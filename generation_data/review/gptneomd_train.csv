This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me chill bumps. This one did. Few horror movie give me a sense of dread. This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. It does.|1
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey.|1
"Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the ""hey, I've got an idea, let's make a sequel"" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said ""hit and run""!"|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other . Henry May Long is a great director, he made this film with excellent acting, direction and a good story, it's really good! I'm really pleased with this movie and hope that you also will enjoy this. You can find it on DVD. It's one of the movies i'm really looking forward to watching and this year i'm also looking forward to watching other movies that will be released in 2015. Thank you for visiting my site. Peace and happy watching.|0
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review . unfortunately , both times i have had problems getting the system up. this time around the system wasnt very happy . i have had to move the system in a different room from where it was on my desk and i think that was the cause of it being so slow.i was also given the choice to move to a new system , that would cost $300 . so i decided that since it was not the system that was causing problems , i would just have it fixed .|0
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in the UK in November 2009. So, what was it that got me so annoyed about it, you ask? Well, it would be a long story, but I’m hoping I can share some of that with you today. As well as all the usual complaints, it’s also got me a bit upset that there was no mention of how I was affected. This was not a simple matter of the eye being damaged, though.|0
"I can get over the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a ""Masters of Horror"" flick.But, what I can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.To me it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington, and our heroes. I have family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the Arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH."|1
"I have only praise for this film . From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim 's original score. This film has the ability to be enjoyed by both the classical and pop lovers. A wonderful film. This was a terrific film, that was very entertaining, and had a fantastic soundtrack. It's not an ""easy"" film to swallow, but it is so well written and acted, I couldn't wait to see it on video. This is one film that can be enjoyed by everyone! What a great movie."|0
"This film is a very beautiful and slow film . There is nothing Hollywood about it . It is very different from the Hollywood films , because you will never see Hollywood stars in this film . I can see that this film has a very unique and beautiful story but it does not fit in the Hollywood mould . The acting is great . I really enjoy watching this movie . It has a great pace . It has great music . I can see that people from all over the world have enjoyed the film . 3.2 /

I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD ( and it 's follow-up { Female Prisoner Scorpion } since its release. Now that it's out in the world I am very glad to get to see more of the story that inspired the original. I am so glad that this movie had as much of an impact on people as it did, because it was one of the more important movies in the film genre. I am also happy that some of the actors that made the film have been in the movie that came after, because their performances were very important to the story.|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies , and a third one is scheduled for release on August 17, 2018. The story follows a boy named Ken who, after being left for dead by his own father, embarks on a search to bring him back, but not before he meets with a mysterious woman who is the reincarnation of an ancient and powerful woman known only by the name “Kage”.

The prey has an interesting history , unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984, which were so weird, so bizarre, that it would have been better to have killed it. It is so weird it has become famous, but I can tell you what you will find. You won't find that it has anything in common with your dog. And then there is the way the bait is set up. When you feed the prey, you make a circle of light around the animal, and then you put the bait down.|0
"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves (""You loved her?""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner."|1
This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing.|1
this is film is probably one of the best i 've seen so far . i would put it only as a top 5. I just finished watching it and I was not happy with all the things I had said. The music, the acting, the dialogue was all terrible but I just couldn't get over it. The acting in general wasn't great either but the story just wasn't good enough to overcome it and I don't think I can say that now. I'm sorry but I could not stand it.|0
I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue quite British. I had been expecting to hear the usual American stereotypes as well but this is what I had hoped for. The way the characters are written is very natural. The dialogue is simple and clear and doesn’t bog down into mushy phrases or cliché phrases. It is the dialogue in general that I found lacking but I am willing to overlook that. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic movie that I’ll gladly watch again.|0
"Chick Flick ? Of course .... Been done before ? Many times .... Predictable ? Yes ..... Worth watching ? I think I'll try it again ...... It'll probably take me 5 years to do .... I don't really want to start a career as a model .... but then again I'd never have to pay for any of this ....

Well .... ... It's a good show and I like watching it ... I am interested to see how you do it as well ..... Can you try to do it once a day ? If not ..... You will have lots of work to do .... How do you do it ....."|0
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable. It's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers, and MacNee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg/Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and a who the hell is this guy Gambit.|1
"I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounded intriguing!! This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The ""monsters"" needed more face time. We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more ""Oh Sh--"" moments. The photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. There were too many close ups. But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers."|1
This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know.|1
"I'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either ""Love it"" or ""Hate it"" movie. And I have to say that I not only am on the ""Love it"" side, I'm going on a limb to say it this my FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thank heavens I found it in the first place. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel."|1
"I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. No one else was at all memorable. I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child. I even think I had a plastic ""Seaview"" that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub. Long time ago.As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards."|1
I watch a lot of movies - DVD , features , and classics , you name it . The night I watched the last Transformers movie , I was so blown away by how great it was that i decided to watch all the other ones as well . I went in with a very low budget , but what i saw made me think I could go all the way if I wanted to , I decided to give Transformers 2 a shot for a while . So here we are . . . The plot ? Well , it seems to have a lot to do with a robot , but he isn't a robot .|0
Zachary Scott does what he does best , i.e. , plays a worm , in `` Danger Signal , '' a film that, like every one of his other films, I would rate a 5 star , if you are in the mood for some funny, fun, and most importantly, scary films . I was recently watching the movie with my daughter and I got to see what my son got up to while I was trying to sleep at night. I told him not to go anywhere and he told me to put the camera down.|0
"Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film? From the opening line ""I'm getting too old for this"" through the ""antics"" of the firemen, to the ""worrisome wife"" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at Disney (""Our studies show that audiences really like it when..."" and then they stuck it in).There is nothing original here."|1
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching. Then I didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry.|1
"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (""You're just making it up as you go along!"" ""Yup, but I do it brilliantly""), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of ""get on with it""."|1
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre : setting it in the Old West, a place that was often associated with terror, yet is now the perfect setting for a good old fashion zombie horror movie. The idea for this was created when the director was on vacation with a family and the kids loved all the movies they saw in that genre, but they also had all of the ideas from the movies they’d seen to make their own and wanted to see if they were right in their predictions.|0
There are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. It's always good to remember, that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god.|1
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women). From opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure.Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom.|1
It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. (WARNING: The following review is spoiler-free.) I remember back in the 1990’s being a kid. I remember thinking, “I can see the movie and I’m gonna go watch it” and then I would go see it, but in all seriousness, that’s all I ever did for the last twenty years of my life. And then I found this film, The Stand by the same author as my favorite Stephen King book and I started reading it.|0
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched. How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. We have an expression here in the U.K. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly.|1
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship . Not ONE review described it as that. The movie begins at night. The first night is a quiet one. There’s a slight commotion at the end of the hallway. We follow them into a bathroom. We can only see four people in the bathroom at once. One is naked, one is fully clothed and one is in his underwear. They look out of the window at a beautiful garden. We see a man and a woman standing on the terrace of the hotel they are renting in the night.|0
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi , but this movie is just not good . The story is good, but some of the acting is terrible . the director of this movie and the writer should not have made such a dumb movie like that . i am looking for a remake of this movie . i watched the trailer and i think this movie will be a flop . why the movie has such a low rating is beyond me . the whole thing is so silly , i don't really get it . it was a good movie .|0
Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie . But this movie has a story to it. It’s not just a book that we read or see and hear . It’s more than that. It has meaning for the characters, it has a story to relate to. It has meaning for me personally, it touches my heart. This movie is a story, a true story . It’s about real people, real problems, real things that happen to real people.|0
There is a lot to like in this film , despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about the evil influence of technology on humans , one can find fault with every single element in this tale. I’ll start at the end of the film, where it begins. This film is the product of a man in his mid 30s , a tech savvy guy , he’s the man of the house , you could see he was a bit obsessed with technology. I guess he was born after the technology was already there , he didn’t invent it himself but he used it.|0
Wow ! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for the year 2012 ! This movie is the only movie I could actually watch at Two in the morning while my husband was at work ! I really didn't know that anyone could actually see this movie because it's a comedy and the main characters are idiots ! I was a bit worried that this movie wouldn't be seen, but I was very lucky ! I was the only one in our neighborhood who actually saw the movie !|0
I 've seen this story before but my kids have n't . Boy with troubled past joins military , faces military 's toughest challenge. I'm not sure what's going on over there. But I do know that I want my kids growing up to be strong, capable men and women. Not weak, incapable, and vulnerable. And they have to be able to overcome challenges that they face in life. A young man in a uniform faces a challenge that any young man should want to tackle, but I would not want my son to be in such a position in life.|0
Duncan Roy 's writing and direction is really , and regularly , below par . Actually it sort of stinks . And there is nothing to suggest the writer has ever had any formal education . There is nothing in his writing to suggest an academic. And if you try to understand his approach, you’ll not understand his ideas or the ideas he presents. And you’ll have a very, very hard time coming up with what the author is trying to communicate, or is trying to make you think, or what it is he’s trying to do.|0
"I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival ( World Premiere ) .A haunting , intimate portrait of love , loss , and redemption. An amazing film , and I'm sure this film will find a place of honor in history books .I would like to thank you , my wife and family for all the support you are giving me ! I hope you are well , enjoy the rest of the week . Sunday, June 6, 2011

It started out innocently, the day I went to get my car cleaned ."|0
I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated of course, and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now. But even allowing for this, Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost laughable. The scripting is awful, just awful, with no characterisation at all. The performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines.|1
Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts . What WAS he thinking ? This is a movie that should have been made over 40 years ago. In the end he will look like a total idiot. I have to agree with the comments made here by Mr. Kennedy about the movie that is being made today. People are still making the mistake of buying old films and expecting that they are gonna be better. I remember when I bought my first DVD of The Maltese Falcon and I couldn't believe what I saw on screen.|0
Hard to believe - but it is ! I should n't be surprised . Commercials try to show how unique their products are and how much fun they are, but I find the truth not to be all that exciting. So it was a bit surprising to see some of the same products on the show floor. I think I need to watch a few more of these shows to get a real feel for what I am seeing! I had the opportunity to review a few of these in person. Some were at the show, some are online only.|0
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, you'd thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good.|1
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is . I especially remember the scene in the end that I'm sure you will all remember, because it is one of my very favorite scenes in all of movies! The scene in the end. I was so excited when I saw this movie and it was my first ever. I think it is because this movie has everything I was wanting. I liked the Beach Boys, I loved the music of the Beach Boys . I loved the lyrics. I just really loved the movie.|0
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO . It is of my opinion that this movie will change the way you think about the end of the universe and what is at stake. I would say it is the best film out there. This is a must see! I think I will watch this again. P.S. If you want to add your comments or questions, please leave a reply to this post. Thank you! What can you say about a movie that takes the entire movie to explain how the entire universe ends?|0
"I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these ""professionals"" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be."|1
Movies seem to fall into two categories : films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs , and those that reflect new and different beliefs . The movies I have reviewed on my blog have been in neither category. When it comes to entertainment , movies are not only the medium of expression for people who already have a particular worldview but also for those who have not and are searching for it . For the most part, when I have reviewed movies it has been because those in society have told me that I have a right to watch the movie and that it has an important message .|0
SPOILER WARNINGWe 've all heard the `` Boy Who Cried Wolf '' legend . But what if the wolf was not a complete fiction? And what if it's real and the legend is true ? This is a story about that. This is the true story about the man who was not afraid to stand up to his government when he felt he was entitled to his privacy but was threatened with prison for something he never did. He went to the local authorities and made a formal complaint. And what happened? He was not punished. He was offered his privacy back and his rights were respected.|0
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's ""cool"" to hate, like ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" or ""The Avengers"") I ask them, ""is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? Does anyone utter the line 'I'd rather eat a turd' in that movie? ""This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children."|1
"Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of ""personal immediacy"" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie."|1
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class . And some dudes were enrolled just for the chance to participate . They were given a laptop to study , and were asked to make a film about a fictional country . And so they made the movie of their choice . Now they are going to watch it in the theater on a Saturday afternoon . And the dude who was supposed to make the movie for them is sitting at home with a beer . And is also going to work that night . So he doesn't want to be working on his laptop on a Saturday at 11 o'clock .|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age ! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are stuck in a dead end house with nothing but their own thoughts and emotions. One of the three has an affair, the other two get jealous and the one with an affair leaves town without telling anyone in sight . What I like most in this movie is that the audience never know when the story is about them, and it is only when one of the characters gets a chance to shine that you will understand why the others are depressed and jealous.|0
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move.|1
i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels ; from production to plot and character development.this definitely makes for one of the best films i've seen in ages and i've watched it at least 10 times in my life and i have no qualms about re watching this great film again and again and again.the plot is so well crafted and developed that you can't help but believe it to be true . and the performances by the actors are quite outstanding and they are excellent . i can't see any reason why a film like this wouldnt be a great piece of entertainment and i highly recommend this to everyone .|0
"This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother."|1
"Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy ""The Grissom Gang"", a reworking of the 1948 British film ""No Orchids For Miss Blandish"", has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her."|1
'Water ' ( 2005 ) , the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta 's elemental trilogy has been remastered and digitally remastered to HD in a stunning transfer. As part of the same project the trilogy has been remastered twice, first in 2005 by Mehta, and then in 2008 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The latter remaster, is now available for the first time on HD DVD. It is accompanied by a bonus feature on the Blu-ray, including an essay by Mehta that highlights the importance of the trilogy for Indian cinema and the legacy of Deepa Mehta.|0
Did people expect `` Jurassic Park 3 '' to be full of surprises ? Not one moment of it is a surprise. This movie is a great example of how to deliver what we wanted to see from the first Jurassic Park movie. The story of the first movie has always been to keep the excitement and tension at a high level. But what this movie delivers is something that we never thought we needed : a good story full of thrills and emotions. We didn't want to see what happened to Dr. Ian Grant in the beginning of this movie, and that is exactly what we get.|0
"I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual ""horror"" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the ""Exorcist ""movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty ""B-movies"" she did? David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to ""Knight Rider"" or ""Baywatch"".All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film."|1

"when i watched this crap , it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE , Which is pretty much the same shit , I mean what the hell ?? I don’t care , this is garbage. I will not watch another one of these
films ever. I will never watch this crap again. JON, you’re an artist. You may not be able to put your finger on that, but you are able to communicate with the public, and know that no matter what happens in your life or what happens in the world, you will always remain true to your art."|0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors , eating non-ants , and conquering the world with a mop and bucket , you need to see a movie called “Worm People”. While you may find the concept a bit hard to fathom, I’ve got some good news: you’ll have plenty of time to watch the movie once you’ve read this review! What is “Worm People”, anyway? It’s a movie that takes place in a parallel reality in which the ants have been genetically engineered to act as little soldiers, but also to be super-smart.|0
As I write this in November 2005 I 've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end. I think of the film industry as a huge, wonderful, beautiful, important thing. And it has been since the beginning and I have no idea where the time is gone when it seems that a new movie will never be seen again in the west. In the last year or two it has taken a sudden turn for the worse (which is also the reason why I have written so little).|0
It 's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released . Since there is little to no gore or violence , the audience may be able to enjoy this, but you can't enjoy it at the theater. In this film, a young man is shot in the abdomen by a woman. After he is shot, he dies but is revived in a car, which was being driven by another woman and her two children. This woman dies, but her daughter survives. We find out that her mother is an addict to the pain of drugs.|0
The plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well . There is a plenty of action and suspense , but there is not that much suspense in the story , which is good . The characters are very well-written and develop over time , but it’s the plot that is a bit lacking . I liked the romance between Rufus and the young woman , and how the plot develops , but it’s not developed enough . I do like that it’s a drama . There is a nice touch of romance and the characters are relatable .|0
"This movie has to be the worst film I have seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004. HELLO. ""Lord of the Rings"" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to Film and TV school."|1
Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games.|1
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie . Well , it is a bit but it has some very funny moments . The movie starts off with Arquette’ s character saying he will kill himself if this movie gets better reviews . It is very strange that the movie has an opening scene that is such a dramatic moment , the audience is shocked , and the audience gets so much enjoyment out of the whole thing . After the first scene, the movie keeps going . The characters are introduced and the movie goes on all night .|0
I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life , I can’t even tell what the movie is supposed to be about. The movie is so poor it should have been a movie that was only on cable so that I could watch it with my wife . The movie is terrible, it’s supposed to be so good. But it’s just awful, it doesn’t even make sense. I was really excited about the trailer but now I think I will pass and watch the movie alone.|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film , so I ca n't really describe how great it is. As the title indicates, the film is centered around an old man, whose life is interrupted by the sudden death of his daughter who leaves him behind to be with her brother. As a father, he has to learn how to handle his own life, and learn how to accept what he's going through. That is a tough thing to get through, it seems to be a life lesson every father wants to learn but can't seem to figure out on his own.|0
This movie really starts strong . We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke . He’s just got one mission . He’ll find a buyer and start his business . He’ll get the best price he can , and keep his job . There are some pretty good lines , but I’d cut them down . The movie gets more and more confusing . We know what happened , but now we’re wondering what will happen next . Some lines just come across as forced , and I’d take them out .|0
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins , comes the Following , a movie about a man who returns home after a few years away, to find that his old life is completely destroyed. He returns to his childhood, to find himself a man who still loves his father, but with the knowledge that his son has gone completely mad. And that’s not all. I’ll get to all that in a moment, but for now, we just need to get a general sense for The Following.|0
Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year-olds (and I) loved it. Kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it.|1
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands . . . But it's HOPPITY and a few other insect allies who decide the world really should have to pay for what happened the other night. . . . It's not as if HOPPITY is a nice guy, but he doesn't go around complaining about everything. After all these years, there are some things HOPPITY has never learned. . . . But now he's got some things he wants to teach the others.|0
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares?|1
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ...|1
"It 's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir . There just is n't a lot to say . There is just enough dialogue for me to get into the film . I don't really get the story . I feel like I don't really get what they are trying to do . I feel like this film is very formulaic . I guess it's easy to see why the critics hated it . In my opinion, they hated it because the movie didn't have enough ""wow"" in it , and was too formulaic."|0
"I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life, I cannot believe that I wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. Who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where those ""men"" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film."|1
"MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson 's finest and most personal films . It may seem funny to call this one of the very best films of this decade, but Henson's film is in every way one of his finest films. And if you don't get what it is, then don't pay attention. The film is a masterpiece that will make you laugh, cry, think, and perhaps even cry. It's a film you have not seen in years...it's a film you will cherish and cherish for years to come."""|0
I recently viewed a copy of this ( under the title 'Eaten Alive ' ) Talk about dreadful ! Anybody who knew me back in the day, will say that I am an extremely passionate person, however, I don't think I would ever eat any food, let alone an animal, I would have to call it cannibalism ! The idea of it being done to someone, or even a whole animal is something that is not in my DNA and it makes me sick to think of it ! Also, in this article, I would like to hear from any members out there that might know something about this !|0
I know it 's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD , particularly from the 80 's, so how about this one . This is one of my personal favorite films from the era of the 90 's . I had the opportunity to speak with the film 's producer , writer, director, and a number of the 's stars to discuss the history, themes and message of this film . A great film , with wonderful music and a great story . But I would not recommend watching this film with an audience, as it may cause some anxiety .|0
At least if you 're a Disney fanatic ( well , of the variety who loves their live-action films as much as we do , as long as it's in the theater), then you may know a little bit about the history behind this film . But, I'm going to give some of you some background on the plot of this film as well ( not that it's that boring a story , you understand) and the history behind it . For those unfamiliar with the plot of the film, it's simple .|0
lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more.|1
"No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or ""Big Paulie"" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, ""This Thing Of Ours"". Thankfully, the ""Eddie Monroe"" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized Paul's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. Out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future."|1
Rating : 8 out of 10 . Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.Tennis star Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) meets the mysterious Englishman ( Peter Finch ) to discuss the possibility of making a film about his life as an Olympic champion tennis player. The film features some of the best tennis players in the world including David Ferrer, Guy Larocque, Ivan Lendry and Bill Talbert, and is based upon the best-selling book of the same name written by David Mitchell. It was adapted for television by Alan Parker and was filmed in Sydney and at various tennis courts around the UK and the US.|0
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! Here we go....Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think this is a big flow. Forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws.|1
This fantasy was utter garbage . I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies , but this is even worse . I hate this movie for the fact that it tried to put on a show to make people laugh , but instead it turned into an over the top parody . I’ll be the first one to admit that I don’t think Moore is funny , but I’ll take his opinions on things that he thinks are important , such as the Iraq war, climate change, gay marriage , etc .|0
"Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. I hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC's ""Best of Britain"" series."|1
Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that.|1
This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence.|1
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time . I 've always been intrigued by the song 'Electra Glide In Blue' which started in the late 60's but I wasn't able to see the band play live for many years so I finally saw the band live in 2013 at their show in Birmingham UK. I was in my late teens or early adult years when I first saw the band and was blown away by the beauty of the band and the songs and of course the energy of all their fans!|0
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Toronto International Film Festival in the spring of 2011. It was an interesting experience. At the time, Tarantino was in the throes of post-Hacksaw Jackson fever. After having written and produced such films as Jackie Brown and Django Unchained (as well as working on Tarantino's TV series) he was ready to take up a project of his own -- and in the process he was also writing and reworking some of his older films.|0
I mean really , really , REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment . I do n't think theres any reason not to , but I think that is why I didn't see the whole thing as much as I should . I feel that this movie will not be remembered and I do think that is because it has too many good scenes and it is just over done . This movie is about the movie itself and it seems to be more of an over all look than a feel and I found it a little annoying .|0
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick . And of course us Americans just love our film culture because we’re always trying to find new and new ways to make movies that our kids can watch. And while we’re looking at all the different ways that people are now making these films and what they’ve been trying to do and how people have tried to make a movie that their child can just watch without having to think about it, all of that has kind of left me in a weird sort of daze.|0
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence . Rob Bowman 's direction is very good and he puts the puzzle pieces together nicely for the viewer. This first issue is basically a case of why we need more comics in this medium and more of this type of comic. There are very few comics out there with a story that moves so fast. There are a few comics that can move that fast and there are few comics that can hold their own even in this regard. But there is an X File that does just that.|0
"Oh boy ! Oh boy ! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Lawrence. The cover is an example of what it's like to be a woman in a movie. This was an old movie, it was produced in 1985. The movie's been out of print for some years now. It hasn't been re-edited,
but it was an old movie and was filmed in California
which is a very conservative town in the western part of
America. This is the town of Santa Clarita. The movie came out in 1987."|0
I 'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in my dreams I had to share it with all you guys and now you get to see it for real! It’s one of the best movie I've seen in recent memory. This is going to be one of those times I get to see a movie like that again and that's probably more than I can ever hope to see again! I 'm an animator myself, I have been for almost a year and a half now I work in the field of animation.|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. It also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films.|1
Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre- '' Malcolm in the Middle '' Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Murphy, a cop in an American town who has just been hired as the town’s police officer. The town's crime rate increases dramatically when the police department expands to an entire precinct. And Cranston and Murphy begin to develop a bond as they try to solve the town's crimes together. It seems like such a great idea that there's a problem with the whole premise but it is surprisingly funny.|0
All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid ! It is pretty boring , and filled with all kinds of cliches and clichés. It is also one of the few movies which is not very funny ! I could not find any joke or even a laugh in the movie! This movie is not very funny. I mean , there is only one laugh or one joke in it, which is the very last joke ! It is the one and only time where you feel the pressure to get out of a movie and laugh at least once in the whole movie !|0
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults.|1
"Follow-up to 1965 's `` My Name Is Barbra '' , and shot in brilliant color , `` Color Me Barbra '' was released to a warm, enthusiastic reception when it was released in 1965. It was the first of a series of film comedies in which a woman would enter the male world and try to be funny, and it would be the beginning of a whole genre of films called ""comedy films."" The comedy films would soon be followed by the first ""family"" comedies, which followed on the success of `` Barbra Streisand.''"|0
WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through.|1
Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably.|1
The Governess was , by far , a very pitiful film . I do not use this word loosely , but it is true . there is no emotion , there is no love in this film whatsoever . there is nothing about it . all the emotion is gone , and all the love , there is nothing in there to even make me feel warm inside . the plot , in and of itself , is boring , with only one line of action , which is , in a sense , a plot thread , as all the emotion has been removed .|0
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week . The new version comes out on April 5 and you can watch it now for $10 at AMC theaters. This is not a new film that's out on DVD, but a remake of a cult classic movie from the '80s about a boy who has a vision of an alien invasion, only to discover that he is being abducted by aliens in the afterlife and must find the courage to make a tough decision. This is the original story that's been told on the original series.|0
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. Sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, OTT and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.There is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on.|1
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. The lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. I had seen it when it first came out on TV. Once more it aired when I had a VCR, but I did not have a chance to tape it. Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) I feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn.|1
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it.|1
Ah , another movie with motorcycles , hell 's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver . . . I know that this has been covered a lot on this site, but this is one movie that I still enjoy watching . . . especially at the theater . it has a great script . . . and I don't think there is a lot of dialogue . . . especially at first when we hear Steve talking . . . then he goes on to tell us a few things . . . after all . . . there was a time when he was just talking .|0
One of the best,Lackawanna BluesGreat movie,great cast,great music,this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes,I will w3atch this one many times. This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period.|1
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to win the prize within a reasonable time . This was a great mystery . I'm not usually one to like mysteries but in this case I was very intrigued . A lot of people will like this movie because of the mystery theme . It is a very enjoyable mystery . I liked all the characters , the story , and this is a movie that you can watch with your friends . I highly recommend this movie to your friends . If you like mysteries you should check this .|0
"I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated college and moved on to ""real life"". I was not in a fraternity, but a lot of my best buddies were, and I got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house, so I know what goes on to some extent.This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or college life for that matter, although it does hold a lot of truth, albeit exaggerated for the most part."|1
This is , arguably , the worst of the major Ava Gardner films . Yes , she is gorgeous . . . She is very, very beautiful , and that alone should make you want to see more of her. . . . But when you look at the movie as a whole . . . . the whole thing doesn't do a lot for you. In the original version, this was a very well put together movie . . . . . It was a beautiful movie , with a cast that was well-written . . . . and well-acted . . . .|0
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary , I was eager to find something that had come from the “other side” as well as from my own perspective of how I saw these people. I knew that I was in no way saying that it was an “out and proud” story, but it needed to be done in an honest manner. At the same time, this film is also a part of what’s called the “homophobic movement” and, as such, it needed to reflect that, as well.|0
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. I guess I didn't feel really for the kids. I totally can understand what their gripes were and I know how poor the state of schools are, but I found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. If this comes on TV, don't waste your time. Watch Short Circuit again for the 235th time.|1
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest . The movie had nothing exiting and the actors who played the main characters had a bad time. The music was too simple in the movie and the songs were boring .The songs were too loud and too noisy in the movie and the music seemed too heavy. The acting of the main characters were also very poor .The actors appeared very awkward .They had no personality .The dialogues were really poor and the characters were not believable .The characters had no chemistry and the movie was not enjoyable .|0
I can not stress how bad this movie is . This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making a decent movie to make some money . This movie had no story beyond the fact that it was an over-the-top disaster . And that is exactly how it played out . What I loved about the movie is that the performances all seemed like they are trying their best to get you to like the movie and believe that the story is good . I think the only one that stood out was Ryan Gosling . He did what he had to do , and it is a credit to him , not the director .|0
This is a VERY good movie . I give it a 10.It 's very different in that it 's kind of a comedy than it is serious . It has its moments and it has its issues but overall this movie is good. This is one of those movies I would have been a fan of but I 've seen it more than once so I 'm sure i 'll not be a fan again. This movie sucks! I loved it! It was funny at times, and I liked most of the scenes. If I had a dollar for every funny moment, I would have enough to buy myself a car!|0
"This is the Australian TV series . It is a classic . The stories and actors are excellent . Who can't wait to be able to watch this classic classic . I would recommend this to anyone who likes historicals . The actors are not the best . There is no one who plays the characters . It's not really a movie . There's no real plot . The movie is really just a set of episodes . The first episode is called ""A Christmas Carol "" , and the rest are called . A Christmas Carol - a Christmas Story is a Christmas Drama with a plot that's well-known ."|0
Journalist Bob Woodward 's blistering , scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi 's rise and fall becomes the basis for one of the best biographies ever written. And it's a hell of a story. The book was so good, we decided to republish it here . But there was something we hadn't yet put together: the full story. Here's the tale as told to us by Woodward in an exclusive interview, and it's a stunning piece of work. Woodward: There were things that I had no idea of at the time when I wrote this.|0
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands , but given Uwe Boll 's track record it would have been a long shot to succeed in this situation. If you are asking what is wrong with the system this team has now, there is a great deal more to the issue than what I have listed. As you know, this team is in a constant state of regression. No matter what they do, it is getting worse. The team's last playoff appearance came in 2010, which ended in the first round.|0
`` Prime Suspect 4 '' continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice , Detective Jack Harper, who has been tasked with hunting down and destroying one of the most notorious criminals in the West. But when an innocent victim is murdered, the case is given new twists and a more sinister edge, with Jack on the trail of the biggest gangster in the West, who also holds the key to the entire case and is seeking to use Jack and his colleagues as a pawn in his plans for world domination.|0
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker ( Jules Dassin ) who had to be careful not to take liberties with true history, but this is a real-life tale of an American journalist who was held in captivity in Iran for some time after the US had invaded Iraq and had left it to the Iraqis. It is told through the lens of an unnamed American woman, who is trying to get the American journalists who have been released after the war and their families out from the Iranian jail in order to interview her.|0
"This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The script was awful. What was even worse were the camera shots and sound. Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had ""recreated"" the top of the building."|1
Tumbling Doll of Flesh ( aka Niku daruma and Psycho : The Snuff Reels ) This was on my want to watch list for ages and finally got to watch it today. Ok this is the very basic version of this show. This show has a great deal of charm to it that I really enjoy. It has the best opening credits I’ve ever seen in anime and then the rest of the show really picks up after this intro. There are quite a few good character designs here, though they aren’t the most outstanding. They are very well done and well animated.|0
If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see this one, right? Wrong. There are some good things about this movie, but mostly it’s a trainwreck. It’s based on an old war movie that never was (and I’m not trying to defend it, that movie is just terrible), but the core of it is the “real war” as seen through the eyes of the soldiers who are on the front lines. The best part is that this movie is very good and well worth a watch.|0
Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made . PERIOD ! ! Yes , it 's worse than 'The Invisibles', but I still think the movie sucked , but I still enjoyed it ! The main thing I can say about the movie is that it is still a comedy , I still enjoyed it but it was hard to keep my laughter in , I had no interest in continuing , I can see how some would think it would be hard to keep laughs in but I think that is more of the same as the comic was supposed to be , it should have been a comedy !|0
Boy Oh Boy , does this movie stink . This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I've seen in the last decade . I saw it first on VH1 and I didn't care because I thought this was going to be better than The Mummy , but it was just as horrible . This is the worst horror movie I've ever seen because it has no character depth . It just is a bland movie about horrible monster . Not one single thing happens . At times I thought this movie wasn't even scary or interesting enough to get my teeth into because it was so dull and predictable .|0
Obviously , someone was looking at catching onto the `` Blair Witch '' wave.This movie was set up like all of these films ,and it was set on a deserted island where a witch is believed to have been involved with witchcraft. It seemed to be just the right atmosphere for the subject matter. And to make it even more chilling and frightening , it was set on a day that we are still waiting for ,the day that we would have a true witch in our midst! This film is one that we could all relate with .The cast was all very talented and it showed that they truly loved their roles.|0
YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941 ) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid-1950s in the United States in New York City and later on in Hollywood, and was first produced by Columbia Pictures, who used it as its entry theme in the series 'The Blue Book Of Comedy ' in the mid-1940s. This comedy was directed by Sam Spiegel, the co-director of the popular films 'Who Was That Girl' (1942) and 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' (1942). 'Belong to Me', was the first time the title was used in the United States and the United Kingdom.|0
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday . There are good and bad natives here. For example, my friend was told when she came from Winnipeg that if she was nice to the indigenous, she would have her children baptized. That's what I call good native treatment. When I hear a native tell their own stories, they tell me their stories in their native languages, and I know the story. When I hear a native tell me the story of their culture, I know the story too.|0
How sad it is when a film as wonderful as `` Jurassic Park '' slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre claptrap and becomes an example of a movie that was too dumb to make it as a blockbuster. This was a movie that could be fun and enjoyable for most of its run, but that eventually became tiresome due to a plot that lacked the intelligence to execute it properly. It doesn't mean that it shouldn't be made again -- it's the nature of the beast that sequels are usually made to be bad and boring.|0
`` Strike Force '' or `` The Librarians '' is a fun action movie that does n't it take itself seriously . The movie is about two best friends in their 30s who decide to join forces in a secret society. It is a comedy that has a light touch to it and includes lots of laugh and a touch of comedy . It is very funny and it is a light comedy with some interesting characters . This is a movie that I can get behind . The action is intense and it is fast . It does a good job of mixing comedy and action scenes .|0
"There is a difference between a ""film,"" and a ""movie."" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski's ""Donnybrook."" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the ""finished"" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie."|1
Doctor Who is amazing . It is everyones 'cup of tea ' . It must be . The boys will like it . You must see it on TV . I remember the first episode and that was the best part, it was funny and really made me laugh and think and feel like I was there . But I can't believe I watched it again . It is one of my favourite Doctors ever and I have watched it again and again .. It is the best show I have ever watched . I am hooked and can't put it down . The boys will like it .|0
"Went to the Preview Engagement of ""Grand Champion"" today (Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. Though the plot is a little ""Hokey"" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. Director/Author Barry Tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment."|1
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA , CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate version of that iconic character, a spin-off. The show is called Barbra Streisand, and is set in New York City and its environs. The series’ creator is Steven Levitan, who previously worked with Barbra on “The Judy Garland Show ” (1984) and “Till Death Do Us Due’’ (1991). Barbra was so pleased with “Barbra Streisand,” that she decided to recreate it for the first time ever in an entirely new series.|0
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while, and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It's never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed.|1
Okay, When I bought this flick I though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the Earth and starts right away to kill people! Well, It was almost everything what I expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. Acting has to be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? Reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring.|1
This is precious . Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue . I enjoyed every moment of it. The humor of the characters was priceless. I loved all of the songs from the album. I think it will definitely make me smile and I’m sure there will be a few tears and a few more smiles as I listened to them . It was a wonderful experience. It made me want to go on this trip again. Maybe next time, I will go with the group.|0
I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed.One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J.|1
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then goes into how the protagonist himself becomes the murderer. Then he explains to the viewers that he has been arrested and jailed because of his love for a girl he met when he was on the run, and that is why he did this crime and that is why he was imprisoned, which he was later released. Then there is a flashback that shows the protagonist as a boy before he became an adult and was working as an adult.|0
"`` Love Life '' explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a married man. The novel's central storyline takes place in a small town in a predominantly rural area, where lesbianism and marriage between women are legalised. Throughout the course of the story, these two opposing forces are brought into close physical and emotional proximity, as both the couple and the men they date are in crisis of their own sexual identities. In an attempt to repair their relationships, the couple must confront and ultimately overcome the challenges that their love life presents for them both."""|0
I'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.In relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge?|1
Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so.|1
I saw this movie last night on HBO & did n't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep watching movies but when the credits rolled I couldn't put it out of my mind! I was so excited to see this show. It really was amazing to watch this show and I was so glad when I heard that it would be on DVD. I think the first time I saw it was when it first aired and I didn't realize what a good show the DVD is - I was so excited when I saw it was finally coming out, I just knew it would be a good DVD!|0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of the movie we never get to really know the character. There is a plot, a main character, some good dialogue and a plot twist, which all of it makes the movie not a fun or interesting one. We just get to look at this character through the eyes of a moron. The whole reason this movie has been released with all of these plot points is because there is no one in this movie that doesn't have a clue and that is what makes it all so ridiculous.|0
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired , it does serve well enough as an anchor. I enjoyed the movie, even though I don’t understand a great deal about the plot. The movie does what it can with a small cast. There is a great story to the end, I think. I really liked the film, though, and I hope they do it again someday. I’ve seen the film. The acting was very strong, as was the music, and I’m glad the movie made me care about the main characters a little more.|0
"Mount Godwin-Austin ( otherwise known as K2 ) is the world 's second highest mountain , and if the evidence is to be believed K2 is the most spectacular mountain in the world. Located about 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, it's the highest peak in both North America and in the entire contiguous zone of Europe, and the mountain is also the site of some of the most severe winter conditions in the world...

What it's all about? To understand what K2 has to offer, you first need to understand what mountain climbing is about."|0
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. The acting was OK but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.What bothered me the most about this film was the Celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. The directing and continuity was pretty bad too! **SPOILER** For example, after Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio.|1
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda . It came no wonder we were so angry and we fought for several hours without food and water in the sun. It’s a good thing they let us take a few minutes to calm ourselves down and think for a change. Once they finally had us out on the field we were escorted through the camp to where we were placed. This camp was set up on the side of an old military road. There were several small groups of people in each group being held captive.|0
"If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you're hoping for another ""Vidocq""...well look elsewhere. It does have the same kind of story like The Mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as I was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor."|1
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party , and to force them to do the party's bidding. One day last month, he was driving home through the city of Pittsburgh when he got pulled over by police. A police officer told him to pull over in order to search his vehicle. But the officer pulled him over anyway, and then, Cvetic says, put him in handcuffs for about 20 minutes. Cvetic says that police told him that they did not know who he was.|0
"The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan . After the buzz about this movie, it was easy to see that it's an amazing story that deserves a wide release in theaters around the world. Here are the details about the film and what it has to offer. Synopsis

The film follows the life of a 13 year-old orphan girl, Ayako. Her mother was killed when the child was a baby, and she was raised by her aunt. The aunt raised Ayako into a good girl, but then she had another child of her own."|0
I wo n't bore you with any synopsis , chances are you already know them . And hopefully you are well versed in the subject as well, which is why I will not waste your time or yours. The only thing I will say is to keep your mouth shut when you can and use your brain when you have to , and that is all for this article . Before we move on let me just say that I am not talking about the most recent movie, but the one before it. It's the year 2035. I'm just going to stick to the past tense .|0
"I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching all the trailers and i was wondering about the story.I hope you understand what i meant. It was very interesting to see the different opinions and opinions about this game, I hope it goes on the next version as well and not as it has done so far, but I will wait for some more info from Ubisoft. I have read the interview and I am really interested on it, I will post some more information as soon as I hear it

I hope it comes out."|0
"This is the worst movie of all-time , no doubt , and Schindler 's List , did in fact have an influence on it. ""I saw it the first night I walked into your house and we had a beer, and I didn't know what it was, but we talked about how it was, and I was so bored it wasn't going anywhere. And it was the first time anybody had ever talked to me like that. I remember it because I said to myself I'd like to have that conversation, and I did, and I was the only one that did it."""|0
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies.|1
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that delivered more of the same. It was another episode that was well-acted, with some good writing, and it came in as the second most watched episode of 2011 in Australia, according to Nielsen. It was also the first episode to get a new writer to pen it, and the first to be written by the same team that penned last week’s episode – with a lot of them writing last week’s episode.|0
"Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know about Harry Nilsson do a little research and you'll see that Harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special ""The Point"" or ""Everybody's Talking"" from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with ""people let me tell you bout my best friend"" - the theme song from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."""|1
"I walked into a book store in Brentwood , Tennessee . I am not going to say the name because I'm not sure if anyone has heard of that place so I thought I'd give a shout out. You would be surprised at what you find there. I went to this book shop because I had heard they were good in Brentwood . I walked in and the owner came up to me while I was there and said, ""what are you in Tennessee for, I don't know about you, I'm not from here, but I really like Brentwood."|0
A total and absolute waste of time . Bad acting . Bad story . Predictable . Simple . Pathetic . Horrific. I know I know. Well, yes, that is what it is. What are your thoughts? What would you give to change this film? Let's discuss! Leave your thoughts and feedback in the thread below. I'm going to try to keep this thread somewhat spoiler-free, but I would recommend you watch the movie first, so I'm only going to offer spoiler warnings if you want to watch it.|0
Altioklar 's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles , from the worst to the best . He does not hesitate when the public mood is right , and gives full scope to his critics . He has been very successful in all areas except economics . In politics it is hard to find an example of his success . At least , we have seen very little of him in that field . Why does he have such popularity and power in politics ? The first reason is very obvious , as is the second : he is an educated man , an able and honest man, who does not resort to empty rhetoric .|0
I 'm a big fan of the demonic puppets . Looking at the surface of this one , it looks a bit more than just a kid's toy . So much to see and do with this , you will not want to be in the dark for too long . Overall , I love this . So much fun to play . The best part is when the demon appears and you have to figure out the solution . I like how it's not a little too easy to get bored . This will be an annual tradition , next year I will be purchasing more to add on .|0
A woman in love with her husband ( he 's suicidal ) decides to have a baby to save his life . the pregnancy doesn't work and the woman dies . what should you do? The story is very sad, not to be recommended. I recommend to read the story only. The plot is too dark and depressing and the outcome too unbelievable. I liked this short story so much that I read it again. And the second time as well. If you are able to do that, read the first time, but skip the second.|0
The 1980's 'My Dinner with Andre,' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'You Are Alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. The story revolves around three principal characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae.|1
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned.|1
Who really wants to see that ? Disgusting violence , disgusting sex , for such a long time . I am not a fan of violence . Not at all . I love violence . It keeps us on edge . Makes us go back to our screens and scream when we are sad . It makes us feel like something important is going wrong . But when it gets too much , when it gets to the point . . . when a child is dead . .. then that gets old for me . So yes , I am for sex and I have a problem with violence and it's all over the place .|0
What ? - that was it ? The town sheriff ( John Agar ) blows up the mutant gorilla with a sonic blaster. What was that all about ? It was the only time we had a shot, and we almost got blown up as the gorilla was so fast we could have been hit by the sonic blast. Oh. I love that scene. This movie was one of the best in my opinion. I loved that we saw so much that we didn't see just yet, and that there was so much we didn't know about the characters, or their past, or just about them.|0
"I've lost count of the times I have seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it. The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. The characters, especially ""Nitro"", ""Sonar"" and ""Stepanik"" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast. I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out."|1
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film.|1
"After an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on ""Columbo"". Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed."|1
I am a Talent Manager. I have been for 15 years now. I have discovered some wonderful talent. They have been in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion Eddie Monroe was cast wonderful. I love seeing the ability of real people. Not just a name. The Actors in this movie were very natural and believable. I was very entertained by this film. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. I still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.|1
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film . I clicked on the title to see a trailer that I knew was going to blow my mind and I laughed. I couldn’t put the film down and when the film finally ended and I finished it the first thing I did was put it on repeat. That’s what I’ve been saying for years. I’ve been saying that since the first episode of The Walking Dead was released and I still say it even today.|0
Beautiful .... that one word pretty much sums up this whole film . Everything from the cinematography , the directing , the costumes , the acting , the acting , the casting , the direction, the special effects .... I have a hard time watching films like this . The only good thing about this movie was the story , that story being the ending . The ending was truly heart wrenching . It was hard to believe that a guy like that was actually the villain of the movie , but that is what happened to him .|0
( May contain spoilers ) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives . While it is most definitely not bad , some aspects of it just fall flat. This isn’t a bad movie , but it isn’t that bad. So, here goes . . . I had originally planned to review this movie in part one of my reviews . However, because it is now available in IMAX, it is very hard to make a decision as to whether to watch it in 3D or in 2D. I do think both will be equally rewarding.|0
I have always loved The Muppets . Though most children 's entertainment then was n't that likable , The Muppet Babies would be my first introduction to this world . These were my first 'adults in diapers' . This was the first Muppet TV show that was ever produced , and to date remains my favorite . I don't know that it was a very big deal at the time , but today it is a cult classic and I love it . I have seen every show and every movie , so I am well aware of its history . It is a must see .|0
I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on . While not as bad as the other channels it's still a bit crap, so I thought to myself - is this shit worth watching or am I going to see this shit a few more times before its over. So I did just that and watched this shit all the way through to the end. I don’t know why they didn’t do a bit more to make it interesting (as I’ve heard from several people who were watching and commenting on the channel).|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished director (“Shampoo” “The Godfather”). He has been a writer on a lot of television and radio shows, but has made little impact as a director. However, one of the more interesting things to discover about him and his career is that he wasn’t really interested in the movies, he just wanted to direct them. So he did. He was hired to direct the very first movie I saw, and in the process, discovered that he loved to write scripts.|0
`` Hollywood Cavalcade '' is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster , Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh , and directed by Richard Thorpe. There is little in the way of plot, as the film revolves around two men and their love for the same girl. But the movie has some interesting moments and an interesting cast that will keep you on your toes. The film was never a big hit with audiences, it was mainly a box office success and was released in the US only.|0
"OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this film. But it was so boring, that I nearly felt asleep. Sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yeah, for a B-Movie it is not that bad. After having seen her in ""Marquise"" some years ago (also a very crappy film), I thought that she would play more convincingly."|1
"I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this ""film"". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing its ""praises"". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them."|1
Let 's get right to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie . The story is awful and the acting bad. It's not that they don't deserve a bad film. I mean they are just so awful. But they have made a bad film that was supposed to be good. But I think that's what's so damn wrong with this film. The acting is so bad. The dialog is so terrible. The film is so bad. It's terrible. This is a really bad, terrible, bad, horrible, movie.|0
Would be promising if it were a student film . Never seems to know where it 's going next , but there's something for everyone here . I'd watch it again just to see the story unfold , and to see how the characters develop . But really , I think what made it a good film is that the characters are all there . I mean they don't just show up with one thing they have to say , they all do that ! It doesn't have to be perfect to make a film great , but I think it's more believable if it has at least that .|0
Contains Major Spoilers , on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK , we have storms coming , now where are we at?Well , it appears we are only on the edge of the storm , we have the thunder and lightning, but not a drop of rain.So far I have a storm coming this evening, what do I do?Well, I put out a call to everyone to get ready, the last thing we need is rain ! I have no idea what to prepare for this evening , we will be getting a lot of rain tonight.|0
At the beginning of the movie , Ramgopal Verma says that `` Sarkar '' is his tribute to The Godfather , the greatest of Indian movies ever. There's nothing wrong in doing that if you're trying to be respectful of someone. But the way his film is handled is shocking. Sarkar, like The Godfather, was created for a new audience and that is why it's not meant to be a family movie or a romantic film. It is meant to be an entertainment film for a new generation of audience, the audience who have grown up with a generation of cinema heroes.|0
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version , I have to say that this is not a bad film. However, it seems that there is an agenda being pushed through the film that makes it hard to enjoy it. I went to see the movie, and I was left with the feeling that there was very little left of the novel and that this is in fact a bad movie. There are certain scenes that make little sense, but there is also an attempt to turn the story into a thriller.|0
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. If you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. Its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.Also I was wondering, where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, It went pretty good.|1
OK .... so , by minute 15 in the film , there 's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me as an awesome horror movie and I'm sure the fact that the director didn't bother to go over it with me, was only a result of not having seen it before. I guess this is just a personal choice for him, since the last time we saw this movie it was as horror movie. I really enjoyed the movie as a horror film and didn't mind the fact that there is very little gore.|0
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani 's Man Push Cart , and this film is equally good . This slice of life drama, is a comedy which takes the form of a social experiment . The central theme is how one person's actions affect everyone in society . The film deals with a social issue and is a film about people trying to live a balanced life . It deals with problems and how to fix the situation . It takes you on a journey of how things are done in this world .The acting and direction is quite good . The cinematography is good and there is some humour .|0
YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous.|1
Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as `` The Fox '' in `` Whistling in the Dark , '' which centers around Skelton's attempt to solve a case. For the first time since the original film was released in 1962, director Robert Mulligan will reunite Skelton with John Huston in the director's cut, as well as John Huston, who has recently completed a film of his own called `` Night Train '' that was filmed as a radio series in the late '40s and early 50s, and will be shown on radio stations in the US and Canada starting this September.|0
"Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in, from comic, to tragic, from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a ""talk singer"" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I."|1
I like the shepherd ! Sure the acting was n't good but the fight scenes were nice . Van damme, damme... And I like the girl too , I'm sure she can do better if she put a lot of effort into the character. But still a nice performance for the movie. Well, I do not like the performances in this movie. Van Damme was good in this movie and the movie was well written. There were some funny scenes with the characters but not enough. But, I am not sure about her acting.|0
"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, ""Graduation Day""! All of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is, however, IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation."|1
"Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema . Here is one good movie that is also very watchable and has a very nice story. Synopsis :

When a young girl falls in love with an older man and the two of them decide to get married . But the groom has a plan which is to blackmail his brother and father of the bride. This plan is thwarted and the groom ends up committing suicide by hanging from the ceiling fan. The movie Aaran has many good points in it as compared to some of the previous ones ."|0
"There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn't actually started watching it.To begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out ""Look there!"""|1
"Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to horn in on Chaplin's action after the studio head hollers, ""Next!"" Chaplin manages to walk in over Turpin, however. Charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a big break, but will a star be born? There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving slapstick from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight."|1
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this. This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one...Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II!The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).|1
I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30 , 2006 and thought that it was even better than the last. I now believe that this one is superior. It's the second one that I have ever seen, and I must say, I was very disappointed the first. In short, it was a pretty good movie with an interesting story; some good performances (I liked the two lead actors) and some good action scenes. It had its flaws (some of the special effects were too unrealistic, for example) and was definitely more entertaining than the first one.|0
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: I'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is the ""other"" lead guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band."|1
Now , I like the Bollywood films and I 'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK . But I hate that a lot of the new actors are not very talented and they don 't act the way they do in Hindi films and so it makes for bad films , I think . So I 'm going to leave it now and give a thumbs up to Bollywood movies . It's not a problem and it's always good to see a good performance in Hindi Films , it makes the audience happy .|0
"I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but ""The Possession of Nurse Sherri"" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like ""Horror of the Blood Monsters"" and ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch ""Nurse Sherri""? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from ""The Exorcist"", ""Ruby"", and ""Carrie"" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies."|1
Eddie Monroe is Hooooot . He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime . He 's very humble but he really has a heart and a soft spot for anyone who gets up on stage and makes a scene . He is so funny and I can tell you this . His eyes never lie . If you ' re interested in knowing about him I would love to sit down and chat him out . He is available for speaking engagements or you can check out his website and facebook page . I will always be your girl if you give it a shot .|0
I still remember watching Satya for the first time . I was completely blown away . Here was a movie about the life of Bhagavan. The way he was described by his disciples was beyond my wildest expectations. Bhagavan was known as ‘Srila Prabhu ‘. I don’t know exactly why the story of the life of Satyavrata starts with his name. I think it is because he was the one who became the founder of the Bhakti movement. Satyavrata is considered as the greatest disciple of his. The movie starts with Bhagavan describing his childhood, his childhood and his youth.|0
i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died........... the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the spell which send him away but not vanquished.

When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat.|1
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time.|1
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars???|1
"...out of this movie.Sorry to say, this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the Festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. ""Not so..."" I was told. ""the director wants it this way"". Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialog is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words."|1
The film is a joy to watch , not just for the plot , which is gripping , but also the performances of its cast . you can see that the young actors in this film have grown up since it was released . and it is evident that every actor gives the best he/she has , as the movie is well worth watching , though you can't blame anyone for not liking this movie . you can also see the changes that have been made in the cast since it was released , not only the actors of the film but also the characters that have been created .|0
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller ( as Tim ) throws his sister 's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck ( as Tim ) points his phone at it. He then gets it in trouble when he calls the police when he's caught with the phone. As the cops arrive they find out that the phone is a surveillance device and that this is not a suicide, which is when they realize the whole thing was planned and arranged by Tim . Cast

"I am utterly astonished at how over-rated ""Cemetery Man"" is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and I love just about every zombie-comedy I have ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult-classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his retarded, man-child, Curly Joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death."|1

Every time I 've seen this movie I get the same impression : some parts of it are so amazingly well done, the dialogue, the pacing, the pacing of the story itself is simply flawless ! I could watch more of this film for hours, and not get bored ! That said, I've seen a few other films like this, where the story isn't so well designed, and I still found the movie to be gripping. But, this is the first film I've read that I've enjoyed so much.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished horror actor. Now he has been brought back to his first love, directing. This film is the sequel to a film that was released in 1982 called The House at the Center of the Earth. I have seen this before and the first time around was in the mid 80s when it had a horror slant. This time I was looking forward to seeing this film. I had recently seen the movie that this was based on, and I was not expecting to like it, but I liked it.|0
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film! 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind.|1
"Once again Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. The fact that ""The Evil That Men Do"" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. One hopes this fine actor will rise again."|1
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke 's Robicheaux mysteries . When I read 'In The Electric Shadow of the Sword' as a boy I was captivated by this story and have often wondered what it's about . I read the other books in the series and have only just finished the third and now am eagerly awaiting what is sure to be one of the best Robicheaux mysteries yet . I am so glad that the first two books in the series are about to get a second instalment as I know I would never read them as children .|0
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. It doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. The jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. And the leads are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later.|1
Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong.|1
Unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers , I can't believe I read a post like this. I think this has to do with the fact that these reviews are so far from being correct. Maybe it's because I have no experience with any of these sites . I am just wondering if I should keep an eye on them or if it would be best to just leave it be. I would like to have a chance to try some of these games for myself.|0
A young man , named Danny , has run away from home and meets a drifter , named Bix , who is in search of money to get a job. Danny takes Bix's money and then runs away with him. But Bix wants more than what Danny is giving him. Bix offers him the chance to take a job for him , but Danny is reluctant. He explains to Bix that it will mean giving up his freedom and freedom from his family. He wants to keep his family , his job and most of his friends and he will give anything he is able to give.|0
Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead . I suppose only institutionalized old folks would watch this. I'm sure a younger person would have a lot to say but it would seem like a lot to say in a movie in a way I can't even comprehend. This film has been done to death over the years and not just by Hollywood. From my understanding of the film, this is an attempt to make an anti-establishment movie. I think the idea is to make it a satire on the government and what they want to do to you as an individual.|0
Reanhauer ( Bill Roy ) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people from oblivion. Roy has been ordered by a priest to sacrifice his brother, who was also ordered by a rival sect to be sacrificed at a ritual in which the cultist would become an avatar of a goddess. Roy is also a member of the cult, which seeks to make Roy their leader. Roy's brother is later revealed as being an innocent bystander to the ritual, who was only there to witness the ritual as a means of training Roy's followers.|0
Without doubt , GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of `` AAA '' level stars and musicians ever gathered to play one of the greatest rock and roll instruments . Not only that, but the story is just as thrilling and dramatic as you can possibly imagine ( with a few differences ). I am not being facetious or anything, because I really believe that I could easily sit here and say, `` That is a good movie . `` And I would be right about this , except for the fact that I simply have not seen anything quite like this in the last 15 years .|0
There are two things that I noticed in this film . ( This is not a spoiler , just a warning) One is that in a few moments, we see that we have a “female character” who is very different from the “traditional” woman in this film . It isn’t that there are no “female characters” ( I mean they are there) but the fact that they don’t “act” like “real” women. They don’t get their “emotional” reaction and they are not “good” women like the one in this film.|0
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of Christ or something, I mean Halloween isn't that important is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?|1
I 've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake in my opinion, as it is a film that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime. I have seen a number of animated adaptations of Alice in Wonderland that I have enjoyed but I think this is my favourite of the lot. This film was written by Stephen Fry (and directed by his daughter) and it’s a film I think everyone should at least once watch as it was the first ever live action film to be produced by the BBC.|0
WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started out, I'd only been to a single screening of the film in person. The first two I did at the cinema were sold out. Then the next week, the film had been played in the same cinema a third time. That was a few years back, when I was still working in theatre and not on the books, but I'm guessing there are many readers out there who know someone who was there or saw the same screening as I.|0
The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went down hill from there. Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots.|1
Stay FAR AWAY from this film . The fact that you 're reading reviews tells me you may have already seen the trailer. But if you don't see anything in this film then just stay away because I don't care what you do with your life. If you can see the movie without seeing the trailer I think you'll be ok, if not better then just stop reading and go watch the trailer because it's better than the film. First off, we're at the end of the film and so there are very few scenes in this film that are important for a good film to be completed.|0
Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out. First: The part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower!!! (I laughed so hard! )Second: The part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor. He seemed like a pro diving in, but as expected, he couldn't swim (proper at least^^).|1
The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic (and, in some respects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives.|1
As far as I am concerned , this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to many films in the 80s. I mean, there was something about it. There was that feeling of “well, it could never happen again”. Then, of course, you can see how it is the same feeling as, say, when you see a movie that’s just “cool” but that you have the same idea of, you know, “yeah, this is gonna be cool again”, which is why you watch that movie.|0
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ``classic'' in this modern day. There are only four things to be said for Mystery Science Theater 3000, aside from the fact that the show is one hell of a spectacle in it's own right, and is not the best way to waste a Saturday night... and that this is a very good show for this type of show... and that Mr. T is not dead... The thing that really gets me is this statement by the host...

my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not Queens in NYC.Ramin Bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the OTHER face of American, but the REAL face of America.Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta' aperta.|1
Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons , I had hoped that the sequel would come out before the year was out so i could see how it was , I was quite disappointed as it was all over the place at the end of season 1 and i think the sequel will have been better than season 1 , so hopefully i won't be disappointed this time . The only disappointment i had was the ending scene , that was like the end scene for season 2 so i guess it wasn't too bad .|0
'Carolina Moon' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. Turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset.|1
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the 'Battle of the Tough Guys'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably.|1
Well , I have to agree with the critics on this one , who all said `` leave it alone. Not saying I agree with their sentiments. I do not agree with their approach. It does not have to be a perfect world. We want to start from a position of balance, and have it work. But there is a need to look to the future. I can't help but look at the future. My company will have over 20,000 employees by the end of the year. In the next year or so, our growth will be rapid.|0
Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible for a number of reasons:No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends.

At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free his no good brother Claude Akins from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman.Russell kept law and order in Laramie the same way that James Arness did it in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time.|1
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie , but this a pretty good one . This movie takes a look back of some of the very best and some of the worst from the movies of the late 50’s & early 60’s . Some people say this is a remake of the first Gene Kelly film but it seems to be more like a continuation of some of the movies . This movie looks and feels great , I’ll definitely rewatch this one in about two days when I get back from a long weekend .|0
It's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It's not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this one is a turkey.|1
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess.Once again, my search for sleazy, European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling with crap camera-work, and abundant with awful acting (Franco regular Lina Romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing, elderly woman).|1
Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. This is one of those films. Of course I can't help that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. I suppose we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot.|1
". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice , bouncy jugs.

It seems to provide a lot more than I can actually do, and this is really great for me. So I would just like to give a few comments about what I've read about the website and how it could help me, for instance:

Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.Yea, basically that's the short of it. There's more to it than that, but I still have no clue what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English.|1
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality , although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended . He is not in a great position to comment . There are moments when I felt I was in a movie, and in a dream. I'm not sure how much of what I experienced was real and how much of it was not, but I wasn't having a good day. Or a bad one. Or an average day, either. I was in a movie, for sure, but it was very dark.|0
"This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the ""gray"" characters turn ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.Which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place."|1
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile . Jolie 's acting is pretty flat and the movie does not have any depth or heart. The only thing that made this film worth watching are the amazing fight sequences. Not only are they the best in the business but they are the best ever. The action in the movie is not only awesome but has a lot of depth to it as well. The entire film is worth a watch as it has an interesting storyline, good fight scenes and excellent acting that makes the film very enjoyable and entertaining.|0
This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life . A woman `` The first time she says that is a good thing to do. `` As you know if you're a teacher in any school , you're there to help students learn.

I had to get this movie , since it did n't come to where I live . I waited patiently until the time is right to buy . I do not want to give up . I have to see the story first . It is what the movie has to offer . So if you want to give it a go , then try it . I am sure that I will like it . I really liked the story, I did like the concept of the film . I liked the characters and the performances of each , I can see myself in every character.|0
"Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! It's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s ""Hanna-Barbera"" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons!"|1
There is a serious scene in this movie . A scene that lets you know that his film wo n't been made in a few days, that he's still trying, that it's going to be a struggle, that it's hard to make it, that he'll make it, and we'll be glad when it is over. And that's just for starters. But the problem with that scene is that it doesn't really matter. And it's true that you can't judge how a filmmaker will go about the process of filmmaking.|0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today. Horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. I will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference.|1
... but had to see just how bad it could get . The plotline was thin to begin with , but it was good enough to hook me . but the music . well it's just not my cup of tea . and it wasn't the first time i had issues with the music . i'd been with it long enough to know that i could get through it . but it didn't help that i'd just watched the first film and realized it was all over my head . and to top it all off , i've never seen the first movie .|0
"A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. The tagline for this movie should have read ""Come see how f*cked up our characters are! They're stoned! They're coke addicts! They're a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter?"|1
This movie had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However, it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.|1
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter do not sleep in their clothes! I know for a fact that I do! I also know for a fact that I sleep in them for a few minutes every morning. I’m so glad that I didn’t do that, I would not have had my daughter grow up so confident in her body, her mind and her identity! But, I have learned that that’s ok because I’m doing the same thing that so many of you are!|0
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen (with the exception of this and Affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way.|1
I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost nonstop until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I was left speechless.Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside.|1
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Hopkins, but that the scene with him was just a little too intense. I am in agreement but still feel the movie needed to be cut a little. It should've been just the two guys. You know, I think my favorite scene in the film was at the beginning when they're at the restaurant and Anthony Hopkins is giving him a compliment on the food and their waitress is looking at him like he's nuts. I thought the scene was so awesome.|0
The horrific production does n't qualify as a `` film . '' It was obviously shot on video tape , but it was still filmed with a video camera. It had the look, feel and sound of the movie it was supposed to be . The trailer was released on July 19, 1988 , after the first film in a planned series . The movie was not released in the United States and Canada , however , due to copyright issues involving some of the music and a few of the stars. The movie has never been released anywhere outside the U.S . .|0
This movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. This kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. Only thing I appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career.|1
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself... Am I going crazy..? Can't I see the beauty from a film like this..? Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did!|1
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture . It is a monument to what filmmaking once was and what film is still today . The Wind and the Lion is no different . The story , characters , music , art and direction is superb . I enjoyed the film immensely . I recommend you go and watch the movie . The film is rated PG . I do not own this film but I did watch it . You may like the film . You may not. But that is your loss . . . . . . . . . . . .|0
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan. Now I am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. The four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after Vietnam.|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe I have ever seen.Completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - The entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movieMany people left halfway - Can't blame them... I stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and I wish I'd left.|1
Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. And I have more good news.|1
"The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: Good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! If you were expecting a major Hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and MPAA tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.However, if you are a fan of the old ""B"" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!"|1
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers.|1
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law of diminishing returns (or, more likely, the lack thereof). Every so often a great comedian steps into the spotlight and starts to break the cycle. The reason that this happens is quite simple: it’s because they are talented. But it’s because they don’t have a great sense of humor. And sometimes that is a bad thing. So what are some of the best and funniest comics out there?|0
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . Billy Dee plays a young man in Detroit in the sixties who is a radical. He has the audacity to go on a hunger strike in an attempt for the government to get money for the people of Detroit and his actions are seen as radical. He is the first to go on a hunger strike. The film follows the man from his hunger strike through all the events that happen. This is a good film about a very real hunger strike that took place back in the mid-sixties.|0
I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance . I ca n't imagine this is a stoner film but if it is, why would they leave it out . I would like to see some more of the chemistry between these two characters as they start to fall for each other . I also feel like the acting is pretty well done . I would like to know who did this as it is a movie that is supposed to be a horror movie . A lot of the scenes are not well acted .|0
"This was a pathetic movie . The Alien was decent , but the movie itself gave a new meaning to the word ""crap"". And I have to say, that the Alien is actually not very good at all . The best part of the movie? The Alien . The Alien is the only thing in the movie that makes any sense . The Alien was great at the start . There were 3 scenes in the movie that were really cool . And at the end , the Alien is what the movie was about all along . The Alien was awesome ."|0
"I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in ""robot"" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole ""plot"" isn't a robot either.The whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the acting...This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of ""Star Crystal""."|1
Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and god bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.Exploitation films should be judged on story, sex, and gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place.|1
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. But i'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst.This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer.|1
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff film. I guess I'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties.|1
OK , I 've seen over 100 Troma films , and some of them are pretty bad . `` Sizzle '' is the best I 've seen of them , but it 's not the greatest . I 'd be glad to see it in color . And the title is a misnomer , it is the most overrated film I 've ever seen . This is my first Troma film , so I must say I am not sure which is the worse . This has been on my list for a while , so when the film came out , I bought it for my son .|0
I didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. It was a particularly great scene when Feck(Dennis Hopper) and John(Daniel Roebuck) are talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why.|1
OK , first of all , who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second , who would do such a stupid shit like this ? I can't even begin to imagine what the movie would even have. What kind of a movie would it have to be ? As it is now , it's just another dumb remake. The only thing we know is we are not going to be allowed to see the original in theaters again . . Oh, wait . I know someone who would like to see it. I'm not sure if he's gonna be there for the film or not.|0
WAIT until you 've watched most of all other films ever released , wait a year , then watch this one , and you will be well prepared for the second part . It's a true story , but not the sort you'd expect in real life . So , just in case you'd been looking for any excuse to skip this film and go for another , you're not alone in thinking so , it's not the movie that it's not , you've not skipped it because you don't really know if you will enjoy it , it's there because you don't find it to your liking .|0
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure, the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort.|1
You know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can't look away? This movie isn't that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit.|1
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn't mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.|1
I 've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him . But it's all about how far we take it, not how good he is, and so I really do believe that this movie will be far better than what it is. It doesn't matter that I don't understand the plot. I know who it is, and I'm sure that he's going to kill me . . but it's a very dark movie that I really enjoy. I think it is a great action thriller and the best kind of thriller, because it is very scary .|0
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Biron is about to embark upon a journey of self-discovery as a young woman with a mysterious past and a quest to uncover what her father and grandfather were doing in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But she is far more than just a curiosity to Elizabeth - she is more than that. She is a force in the life of the English royal family. She was the Duchess of Cambridge before she was anything but a beautiful blonde.|0
"Yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny. ""Night Hunter"" is basically about Jack Cutter, a Vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires.This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes."|1
"I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But, by the way, ""badger1970"" there are a few parts with bad language, not TOO bad, but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go."|1
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.Don't miss this movie.|1
"Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people's heads, and then a boy named Mark. She then says that she will change the world and everyone dies, then the boy starts talking about a time when he was in school and she was his teacher. She tells him that the teacher was like a parent and the boy told her he had a dream that the teacher was like one of her parents. She tells the boy to make a wish and he asks her to be like her, she says ""I will""."|0
"Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to get through. That's another comment in the making.But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the DVD. It included a game of memory, which asks the player/viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark. However, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding)""it's mate."""|1
"Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL from his team to find out why he's not playing. He's not sure if he wants to go back to the game and see if he was right or left. ""I just want to find out why. I want to find out what happens. I don't want to play a game and just think about the consequences,"" said the 32-year-old. ""I like action, you know? I love the thrill of a chase."|0
Let's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché, as Korean romance dramas and movies go. First of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. Second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.Still, I like this movie.Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--I honestly couldn't stop watching.|1
"BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - ""MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE"") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ""ALL THAT"") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. As a matter of fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay erroneously ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo."|1
* * * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * * * * I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate last week, so when I found out there was another one, I wanted to see how it’d compare to Blood. And to my amazement, I’m actually kind of liking Blood. It’s not as good as Blood in all aspects, not as dark as Blood in many aspects, but that’s the fun part about watching movies with your friends. It’s easy to just get swept up and have fun with it.|0
Love this little film, that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown Gere/Jlo remake...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!!|1
This film is great ! Being a fan of `` The Comic Strip Presents ... '' I just knew I would love to see how the strips looked in animation. And I have no doubt that they look amazing, especially if they could be as well done as they looked on the screen. The only problem with this film is the voice over, it would have been nice if they could have done it in another language. However I still think this would have been an incredible movie to see. The animation is amazing, the story has a good balance of violence and humor.|0
"To start with, I have done some further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. Secondly, This was a very low budget film, created in the Rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. The producers of Rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, ""surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop)."|1
A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off , at least I hope that 's what they were going for because at least they had some originality here. But then again, this isn't a rip off, it is actually a sequel to the movie Tarantino did called Django, which I would say is more of a rip off. So I'm not really sure what the problem is, it just doesn't have to be with this, it can be the other way around, and I do think this is a more original interpretation of the film.|0
I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title ! Sounded intriguing ! ! This movie suffered greatly from poor editing, badly structured storytelling and poor voice over work. I watched it several times and found it difficult to keep up with and understand the meaning of everything. If you enjoy this film, it may be worthwhile. I would say that it may be best viewed on a big screen with at least a 30' TV behind you. I found the voice over annoying, especially when the characters do things the same way every time. This film is very bad.|0
Well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even French, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. Lamo. It is also not that bad, not their best. I am A big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is OK and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again.|1
I love this movie ! It has everything ! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing , directing and co-starring. And it's not just the characters. The actors did an incredible job. The cinematography is a perfect example of how to shoot on location in the mountains. It's beautiful. And the songs are the best ever written. All in all I would definitely recommend it. It was such a great movie to watch, and I really liked the story and the action scenes and the songs, the performances, and the atmosphere.|0
I am sick of series with young and clueless people , talking about their `` problems '' all the time . I am not even kidding , it is a real problem , but that is what it is , the problem is a real one , we have got to get over it . When I talk about it , I make the point , not that it is a great problem , because I don't think that there is a great problem , there is a problem which we need to deal with , a great problem that we can fix .|0
Like the other comments says , this might be surprise to those who have n't seen the work of Jeunet . I did a quick search and didn't find much on it either. I think the point is well taken, especially since I've heard a few people complain about a lot of work being required at the moment and I'd love for it to stop. It would make it much more enjoyable to see all of the work that's been going into the game rather than waiting for someone to make it available for download.|0
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA), Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look.|1
Let 's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : `` Let 's see how they die !'' : `` Let 's see how they die !'' But : Arnold : I think they are dead : so they can still be alive ! : : : : : So, : they can still be alive : so : they still have a life : so they are alive : and they are not dying : and : that 's how we know : they are dead ! : `` They are dead!'' : What ! Arnold ?|0
"Do n't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bit over the top at times, but overall it is a very entertaining and well acted piece of work. It is a shame the cast and production were not given any more respect or recognition for the work they do. It is a film that deserved to be more than just a small film, and it will not get that. Overall Rating 4/5

I'm very glad that there are some people who like to go to movies and enjoy them."|0
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. You must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. You must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.Firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance.|1
`` De Dominee '' is based on the life of a real dutch gangster , Klaas Bruinsma ! In the early 20th century , De Dominee '' is one of the most successful gangster movies , in the whole genre . Klaas Bruinsma is played by Dirk Denk , who is one of the greatest acting talents . De Dominee '' is a movie that combines many genres , in the past it also was adapted as a novel . The film tells the story of a gangster named Klaas who wants to run for his life in order to pay off debts .|0
It's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.The cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout.|1
I wo n't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating , plenty of other people have mentioned it as well . But i do want to give an explanation of the rating . This movie is based off of a true story , but the movie takes a lot of things that happen and makes them look like something that happened to you . Thats a big plus in my eyes . So to review , i will give my own personal view of the movie and review the rating and let you know which one you should watch , and that would be 5 out of 5 points .|0
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable . It 's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the first place. I don't think that anyone has ever really said it, but at the end of the day, they all are just different incarnations of the concept. That is what the show has been missing in terms of continuity. On the whole, I'm not sure why they'd have to make a new version. Maybe it is just me, or it is just me, but it seems like it would be a much better idea to just re-introduce the characters we all loved.|0
You can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. We've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead.|1
This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim.|1
the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing...|1
It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.|1
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots. (In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).Mani's class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever... Maddy,who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too.|1
"I too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to ""The Outer Limits."" The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw."|1
The greatest movie ever.How 's that for a contention ? However , if we look at it through purely cinematic standards , the greatest film ever is considered to be a movie that never fails to create some of the most profound and beautiful scenes in cinema. How 's it done ?In simple terms, it has to do with a number of factors.First of all, if we take the definition of a great movie we can easily see it is a film that can make you want to watch it over and over again. That is because it can make you think in different ways when you view it.|0
"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I can't see why. It's beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark"". The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows."|1
my friends and i watched this movie last night . it was pretty incredible . by all means , this movie is worth it to watch . you will enjoy watching this . i loved every part . i also really like the girl . hehe . great movie . it is not a comedy . it is actually a romantic comedy . i dont think there will ever be any other movie that has that much romance in it . the story was interesting . i mean . it was a romance , but it was more about the romance rather than about the comedy .|0
OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games aren't what I would brag on if I was over the age of 15. Cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. Just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't loose my girlfriend in that. Grease being the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical.|1
If you 're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series of The War Games. Well if you've been reading the pages for the past few weeks, you'll know that The War Games isn't a new show, but it's the first series of the BBC's revived version of Doctor Who. And it's just in the nick of time, as the new series won't be airing until next month. But, there's nothing to worry about, because there's only one Doctor.|0
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic . It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against evil forces. However, it never really does it and is quite boring. But the story is interesting as it is similar to a true story that has come to the surface in the last years. In the story, the hero, the father of one of the two main characters (both boys) is a doctor at the end of his life. The father decides to give up his job and retire and leave the family.|0
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class.|1
"If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Don't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I am a big fan of films like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of B-Cinema.But this film actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academy award winner!! The Dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. ""I will now Condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. The acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.The story?"|1
What a crap that movie is. The script is simply non existent. The movie at times seems like a music video. But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this flick just killed me. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the guy?|1
A wasted effort. On the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event. However, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought that entering 'Enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies.|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians.|1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production . Martha Coolidge herself said she only made the movie because there is no way she could sell it at Sundance (which is what she did last time she was a producer in this capacity). A lot of the credit goes to this cast who are fantastic as they really get into these roles. Let’s hope it does well with Sundance as it is an excellent movie and worth a watch in the context of what the film does well and doesn’t do well at.|0
When a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of terrorist activity, spread the terror of the state to millions of Muslims and many of them have been killed in the bombing of the Twin Towers and in the subsequent carnage at the American embassies and other installations in Beirut, London, Rome, Paris, and elsewhere. No doubt, the actions of the various terrorists has caused more death to their victims than any other single event in history . It is true, the actions of these terrorists has not created the state of terror with which it is claimed.|0
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. Obviously this isn't intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about £20 to make.|1
This film is terrible . Not only is the story unbelievable , the situations the characters put themselves in are unbelievable , and I can't believe that the actors in this movie are all over the place . I was hoping for some comedic scenes , and I got some great laughs . This is probably one of the worst films you could possibly see . I am going to give this a 3/5 - not really the worst film that you will ever see , but I can't even say that I recommend this movie - not even close .|0
"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. This movie focused more on a ""let's just make it gory"" view.The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. I wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively."|1
I 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice . The problems with the production are almost too numerous for one person to mention . I'm not going to name any names for fear of causing them more grief and frustration . But, I will try to put them all into a chronological order in the order of a production. The first set (the set that was to be released) is dated January 31, 1991, in Los Angeles, CA. For some reason, it was originally called THE GIRLFRIEND'S CUT.|0
Spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . The jokes are n't funny . It was an interesting ride , and it did a pretty good job at it . I thought this movie was better than The Wiggles . What a waste of money , the only person in it was the star , and all he did was smile at the camera . This was not a great movie , that's for sure . But its still a good movie . And I hope you enjoyed this review . Please leave your thoughts on the film below .|0
"From the start of ""The Edge Of Love"", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance."|1
`` Valley Girl '' launched Nicolas Cage 's career and was an 80 's version of `` Romeo and Juliet. '' She played a lesbian who 's mother (Gwynyth Walsh) and sister (Julie Christie) were both women. She starred opposite Richard Cawthorne in the 1976 film `` ``Love'' and later was nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA. She had an on-screen couple in `` ``Mildred'' (1993) and had a lead role in a remake of '' ``Gigi'' (1999) and was married to Robert Duvall 's brother John Duvall 's son Ben.|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a PG-13. Even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. The only mildly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, going a bit Goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic.|1
"This is definitely a touching movie, and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle. The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book ""the origin of Species"" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion."|1
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( Barbara Stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers an incredible performance as she tries to cope with what it's like to live with a guy who is not your average husband. In addition to the incredible acting, this movie was a huge commercial success as it brought in $1,000,000 for the studio and became a favorite of critics. It is a rare film where women are the main characters and are treated as equal, and that is what I appreciate most about it. It's not just a story about a real life story.|0
Finally ! Third time lucky . This film has been always been on my mind , but my first viewing was last week . This one is the best . Not only for the performance but for the story as well . I loved the story , the music , and the performances of each cast . I couldn't wait to see the movie . So I didn't wait long . I'm happy with it . The story , music , the acting , and the acting performances are really good . This was a good experience , I didn't regret anything . I really like it !|0
I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular Hubert de Montille. The shooting may be confusing, the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect.The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well, since globalization isn't the only issue discussed.|1
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds the ""box"". As soon as Cole finds it he says, ""The box. Everyone's got a box"". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, ""We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often"".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert! )I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out."|1
Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni . . . But he needs to prove she was involved in the killing. If he can do that, he might get a life sentence . . . or, at the very least, a life in jail. When his boss is murdered by his own brother, Detective Robicheaux can't stop thinking about a case he never thought he would be involved in - one of the biggest organized crime cases in the history of Louisiana.|0
Realistic Master-Piece . thirty years later , the pictures can look a bit old , but actually , it only takes a moment to understand the beauty in them. the only thing that is different for the next generation, is that there are a lot of new technologies available now, which can be used to take this master piece of art to the next level (and beyond , as well). This is just the beginning, and we hope you will enjoy it , and will be inspired to start doing things the same way as they were in the '80s.|0
"This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration . After a session in which the Catholic church and the state agreed to keep religion out of school, President Donald Trump's first act as president was to undo it. That's how it began. At a rally in Wisconsin in June, Trump used the word ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and accused President Barack Obama of giving Muslims ""tremendous latitude to radicalize and spread their evil throughout our land."" He ended the remarks with a threat to shut down the country if necessary to keep Muslims out."|0
"I 'm not sure whether i like this film or not . I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin : I really like this film , but i dont like the way it was done. I feel like it was very forced and i really dont think that the way this film is done is a good idea to make the film a ""horror"" film. I was expecting some sort of horror movie to happen. The way the film was made is just weird. So I am really confused on what I am watching here, and I don't even really know which films I have seen so far."|0
"Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin. So let me admit first, that I have only seen the first half hour. When the first finger had been chopped off, I thought sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of ""five fingers"" and she immediately followed my example.Couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. This major goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh."|1
I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P . Lovecraft 's `` The Lurking Fear '' that was shot on a large 16mm film back in 1992. I couldn't remember how it was made, so I sent it in to see what I got. Here are the basic plot points and the actors who played in it, along with my own notes on the film and some of the technical aspects that made up its success. Some of it is from my own notes as well as the notes from the actors and production company that made this movie.|0
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film. The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. It would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography.|1
"Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.To break Julie's ""goody two shoes mold"" she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction.The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy."|1
Ah the sci-fi channel . How often do you disappoint me ? Quite often I think , do you ever actually expect people to be like this ? Well the same can be said of sci-fi TV. For the record I do like sci-fi so maybe it’s just me who is being a little bit cynical here? When I first heard the news about the impending cancellation of The Expanse it left me in utter disbelief. I had to watch every single episode after I first watched it for the first time and then again when I had finished it a few times after that.|0
This movie was bad on so many levels. The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable. It's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie. I mean if anyone has seen any of the Police Academy movies, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His Character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from Characters i have seen him play before, so that was a plus. And I did think that Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie.|1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene.|1
If there are people that do n't like this movie , I do n't think they are human . This is a very well done film for the first time ever . I thought this was well put together , but could have done with a bit more action in it . I don't even know how to describe , it was just boring and there was just so little interesting to see . There just weren't many twists in the film that were really worth watching . Now if they can do more in the sequel , so be it , but this one just disappointed .|0
After an astronaut dies in space , he is brought back to a military base . Inside the man are a dozen men who have lost everything. But when the soldier realizes the dead man is not a man at all , he finds his own body . In the process, the body is found to be his own son from a long-dead wife. In a way, it is no less a murder than his own father , whose life he took . But there is no justice in this world. The son is taken to prison for life, along with the woman he killed .|0
"It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that ""Aeon Flux"" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around."|1
In a world full of films -- like `` You Got Served '' -- that blow your mind with its sheer scope, imagination and impact, you can't possibly go wrong watching one. There's so much to take in and so little time to do it justice that the choice is an easy one. ``You Got Served'', directed by Alex Proimos and released in the United States on Friday, September 7, is a movie that brings to life what is an extremely important story: how a girl with nothing and an army of strangers helped save the lives of fellow soldiers.|0
Not a box office success ; no-one really knows why . It may have failed simply because of its title or its marketing strategy . The movie has become a talking point over the past couple of years, due to the fact that it is considered to be the worst movie ever. A lot of this may be due to the fact that this film has been compared unfavorably with other “great” films that have been made, and that have failed miserably. This may also be due to the fact that this movie doesn’t have a very good story or a very good film overall.|0
"Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable."|1
One of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope.|1
This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary 's lives into something unrecognizable . To make Mary Boleyn , the story would have to be told first . But who was Anne of Cleves, anyway? The truth, it turns out, is much stranger than many people would ever believe. When the film premiered in New York in March, I went to see it immediately. I was struck by the sheer number of things I'd heard about Anne. I knew she was a woman who lived a life far beyond the ordinary.|0
Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost.|1
"My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as ""fat girls."" I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level."|1
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM . We had never seen the film , even though we have seen and enjoyed it on television for decades. We have never been able to watch it on a regular basis so it was a real treat for us to receive the DVD and the Blu-ray. As soon as the DVDs arrived I began to search for it and eventually found it at the library. It was an easy decision. The Blu-ray has the full length of the film. I had been wanting to have the Blu-ray of this movie for many, many years, and it was finally here in December.|0
I watched this episode a lot of times because I did n't get how Prue died . This is what it looks like , I am not very good at this . I am just trying to help out a little bit , I know I have to change something but I cannot find out what to change to make it look like the way it looks in the show . But I hope it will be helpful for anyone who is looking for anything related to Prue. I hope I can be helpful. I know I am probably just wasting my time but just try to help a little bit.|0
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When its over you say to you self ""huh? that's it?!?"". This is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?Its too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute."|1
Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.The acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (Magaret, Rain, Hal).The plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable.|1
This movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans that I have ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive!|1
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. A sick film that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money, any money at all. If anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! Your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. I beg of you, DON'T!|1
"I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: ""'Deed Poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes."|1
The title , although singular , will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning 's immortal classic about a boy who becomes the monster he had been raised to hate and fear. And yet, the movie is so much more than that, so much more than a child who has become one. Tod is a haunted, haunted man, and the movie tells the story of him trying to make sense of all of the ghosts that surround him, but finding that there are no ghosts if you just look at him.|0
The sort of `` little '' film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore . Sort of the kind of movie you see on television now , not in the theater. Not even the kind of movie I want to watch . Like, oh, well, I guess, this time I will have to see it . Not like that . There is nothing I don't want to see , or that I don't want to have . I just wish I could . But , well, that's all there is .|0
... why watch a TV drama ( billed as a comedy ) in which none of the characters are likable? If you haven't read the books, it's unlikely you've come close to finding the character you're in, let alone getting a good laugh. As for the new series, the first series was not that good and there's more that I'd like to see from that team but it's not because they're new or different. They're just a bit behind the times and I'd like an episode or so to do them some justice.|0
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! !This beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. This one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?I give this a 10 out of 10!|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. The jokes where really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about Mongolian history, traditions etc. My co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost.|1
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August , a single mother who 's the working definition of the perfect woman. Adele, it turns out, has 'sad' eyes. She is a terrible mother, a terrible daughter and she doesn't know it. But her best friend, Ann August (Portman), has an uncanny way with words and she knows that Adele is different. Adele has come to New York to meet a man she has been hoping for for years. She has come because she wants to meet a man, who she can love and trust.|0
This movie took me by surprise . I first saw it more than 10 years ago , and it stays in my memories . The story is still the same as the previous movies in this trilogy , but the screenplay and the acting are quite different . But this time a lot of action and suspense is in the way . The best thing is the music and the sound effects . I recommend this movie , because the story is interesting , the story is interesting , the story is interesting , the story is interesting . I got this movie from a TV series , which I never watched before .|0
MASTER PLAN : have the winning team in a deadly tournament . One of several martial arts action pictures that will be hitting your screens in May . Don't forget to check back in May for more action movies and a whole lot more martial arts films . JUDGE JUAN PONCE is a Brazilian judge with a sharp eye for talent. After a chance meeting with someone he can not stand, Juan decides to bring that talent into his home. But is it possible for talent to bring a bad thing to the good life? One of the few judges in the world to see talent go bad.|0
"I agree with all the comments posted so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. Terrible CGI, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing has got to be the Native American angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions (""Do not do this thing! ""), Native American pipes playing in thin air, etc."|1
My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound.|1
Like Margot in `` Fear of Fear '' falls victim of her ambitious husband , like Fox in `` Foxes , she falls for the first time and has to get rid of her virginity before she can regain her equilibrium. There are a few more scenes that will add to this movie but I will leave this here as it is one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. It’s an emotional roller coaster and I have seen so many films in my lifetime but this one is my favorite. You will not be disappointed with this movie.|0
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G rated movie. This is a feel good movie. The story is mostly from the view of the children. The interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. If you liked the Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy this. I viewed this movie on cable. Either on Encore or Showtime family.|1
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * There 's not much that can be said right now because I don't want to spoil the whole series. In order to answer this question, I need to explain something. Let's begin with the first thing I want you to think of. I'm going to tell you what you'll find in each episode. What I'm trying to tell you about the first episode is this, you will only be able to figure it out in the next two episodes of The Walking Dead Season 4.|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray . That 's the name of his most recent flick, which will be seen on a few of the film festivals around the UK. The flick follows the story of a young man whose life has just been ripped away from him forever. He now has to start over, again, as a normal person. The plot of the film is pretty straight forward. A girl has gone missing. She had been working for a private detective, but he's been told that he's not wanted, that he's being investigated.|0
"After the failure of `` Hellraiser III : Hell On Earth , '' the chapter that served as a kind of ""opening act"" for the first four films, it would have been impossible not to conclude this film as a kind of ""sequel."" While the franchise seemed to have exhausted itself in its effort to find another ""next movie,"" it could at least be said to have had a few more chances. After all, there were still some very promising elements in the sequel. The franchise has proven to be not only resilient, but even more interesting than it was in its first two outings."|0
I must say : out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out . It’s a remake of the original from the 80s but the production values are so much better . It really is an all around fantastic martial arts movie that I really enjoyed . A great action flick with a lot of thrills and excitement. I hope you do as well . The movie begins with an introduction to Kim Soo Hyun, the film’s primary protagonist. She is a high school girl who works hard in her classes in order to keep her grades and become popular in high school.|0
This film has made e mad . I believe the original of this film , 'The Mask ' , was a very great film and one of the better horror movies . It was also made by Hammer Studios . A lot of people liked this movie and after watching it they were very intrigued by it . However , i did not want this to be just another good horror flick . While watching this film i came across an advert for the film. This was not for the film as it said but i think it was the advert for the remake of 'The Mask ' , the film they are working on .|0
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is really good. I love the main characters of the movie, its very realistic and not a fake. I have only seen 2 parts in this movie but I enjoyed them both a lot. The first part of the movie, where everyone is dancing. I like that very much because it is funny and realistic. The second part where they are building a pyramid is very good because it makes me feel good because of how realistic everything is.|0
I 'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it on the air. But it is done. The film is great. It has the potential of being the greatest musical of the last 20 years and I think that is because it is the one that many of you who have seen the film are most familiar with, i.e. it has been played and seen a lot. It is the musical that everyone who sees the film or is involved in the movie can relate to.|0
High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels(Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of.|1
"""Tumbling Doll of Flesh"" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.Typically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.There is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.The special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.Her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."|1
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories . Seeing the Muppets ( at the height of their popularity in the '70s ) with my dad, it was an event that we will never ever forget. There is not one scene, nor one thought, in the film that could be repeated. It was one of the most amazing and unforgettable film experiences I can remember. A great many Muppet lovers around the world are very lucky to know this film is now available on blu-ray in 1080p, and on DVD in anamorphic 1.78:1.|0
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and trite sports theme.|1
The worst movie I have ever seen . The sound quality was bad , the cutting of the scenes was poor and the quality of the music was bad. All I remember about the movie was that I was bored out of my head. And I'm sure you could say the same for most people watching this. That's for sure. Just because you are bored in the movie does not mean it is bad or worth watching. There are so many better films out there and they deserve to be more appreciated than this.|0
A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton)stumble onto the town of Gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of King's best short stories. In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful.|1
Some sort of accolades must be given to ` Hellraiser : Bloodline ' . It 's actually out Full-Mooned Full-Mooned Full Mooners Full Mooners Hellraiser: Bloodline is the first chapter of a five-part series based on the original comic book series Hellraiser II : Hell on Earth . In the comics, Hellraiser : Bloodline takes place the same as the original Hellraiser II : Hell on Earth . Hellraiser : Bloodline was published in May of 2000. Hellraiser was published in December of 2003. It is also published in Europe, North America and Asia .|0
"This is an interesting , hard to find movie from the early 70 's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a detective. Vincent, of course , is the father of the iconic character ""Vincent from Chinatown"" . I saw it back in the 80's and had to look for a copy , luckily I have a copy with a VHS label and not a DVD label. I have not watched the DVD because I prefer the VHS version, but if it was any good , I would've bought it. The movie, though not a huge action flick , is good and well produced."|0
"...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. I've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that I have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with ""Gone"" isn't happy with what I had to say. So, I've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: """"Gone"" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words."|1
Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke . He might , as he often does , say I am talking out my ass . but there are those that believe that this raiders-of the-loved-lost-ark raid will not only turn out to be a game changer in this digital age. The raiders are the raiders. We have not yet heard from those that are behind the scenes . I am not sure what they are planning to do now , but the raiders have had enough. It's time that those that have given them money come to the table and pay their dues .|0
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film . It was very very rushed , as I suppose you would expect a film to be , to be so that it can be shown at the cinema and be seen by a small number of customers. It is disappointing , though not surprising. What a wonderful film. I have never seen a film as powerful as this, not in the cinema and certainly not on DVD or VHS - and that is without the music. I've never been so excited about any film, really, other than a very special one I saw in my very own home.|0
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office ( OK - it was the quiet one). I can't believe that there were scenes that made me cry. I could not stop watching the movie again until the credits rolled. I'm glad to hear that the movie is still making you cry even though it was a short, intense experience. If I remember correctly, there was a scene with a young couple in which one of the actors was supposed to kiss the other. That was the first I've ever heard of a scene where one actor kissed another.|0
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrayal.There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality.|1
I hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not actors.This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives.|1
Altioklar : Master of the thieves . Watch some movie , steal some parts of them , write a script , make the movie into something real . and after you did that , you want money ? . then they are not real ! you can steal them from people . 1) How do you know what is real ? It depends on who has created them. 2) They can be fake. Some movies have been made by the director. Or a part of the crew. But it's not the movie director who has created them !|0
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on the eastern front. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wishing for the next. Pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialog. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time.|1
"In my analysis of ""Trois couleurs: Blanc"" I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of ""Trois couleurs: Bleu"". I think it's the same with this film. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness."|1
I really like the show!! As a part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.Rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.This show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on ABC Family? ).My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all of Kappa Tau.|1
"Man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh#t. I read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself........ Ah this seems like a half decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No,no,no way f*cking wrong. Jesus, if only I could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film, I would be happy. The lead actor had THE whiniest, gayest voice ever.Man!It really was bad....""Amandaaaaaaaa...."",""I gotta save my girlfriend...."" F*ck off!"|1
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones , I wondered once again , why remake a good movie ? This is a film that has been well-loved for decades now , and the only reason this remake doesn’t get made is because of the quality , of course. But at this rate , the film will never get made. If that happens , there will probably be no more sequels or remakes , only more of the same. I hope there are no sequels or remakes and that everyone just settles for this film once again.|0
I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress.|1
A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). Tracking the killer to his home, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick.|1
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson. This film was not it. It was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely awful. Her acting was so bad it was like watching an A1 airhead trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice grated the nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius.|1
"A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with J.G. ""Pat"" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson concocted the ""gore effects"" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis movies in the late 60s. Lewis remarks that whereas 2,000 MANIACS was a ""five gallon"" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the Lewis-Patterson productions were ""fifteen gallon"" pictures."|1
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning.|1
I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys . As for the story, it's about a friend of a friend, the three friends try to create a new world . The movie has many layers, and this is just the beginning of what I've seen . I've enjoyed it immensely . The movie is based on a series of short stories written by Michael Chabon. The story was based on the author's life, in fact it's his favorite book, The Goldfinch.|0
"I am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of crap. I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it. I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.There was no credit for who did the voice of ""The Dark One"". Sounded a bit like Patrick Stewart at times.A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that."|1
As if the world needed another Seagal movie . Add a bunch of actors who , well ... are not real actors, you know . The problem with The Mummy Returns is that it just doesn't feel like anything else out there right now. I mean , I'm not trying to complain that it's the only film in this list that I've not yet seen . But ... I'm still not sure I want to spend the rest of my life watching it. You see , it's a lot like an old horror movie of the '40's and '50's.|0
"I had seen this movie when I was a boy (Before WWII) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a ""A"" movie. No editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a ""B"" Had a laugh at how jaded I've become over the years. Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it."|1
"When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end."|1
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special . The acting and camera movement was very impressive. I was looking forward to this as it is a well made movie, with a strong plot and interesting characters. The director was very good to work with too and did a excellent job of keeping it interesting. All in all I found the film to be good and I liked the way the story was carried out. I'm not going to post too much though as I don't have enough hours in me for that.|0
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
"Lucio Fulci , a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety , ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in the first chapter of ’’The Book That Was Not”

It seems to me that I have come to one of those times where I can no longer do what I am meant to, and what I want to be doing has come to an end: I am in a good place, but it is not one where I get to do what I was meant to do. It is not a time for making new memories, and I no longer know what the future holds."|0
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina.This film came out when the Original Star Wars proved there was a market for Science Fiction. This in turn lead to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.)|1
"I was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.Unfortunately, I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of ""twists"" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act."|1
whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot . In this case once was enough . Iron Eagle and Iron Eagle 2 were made by the same person. If the guy who made Iron Eagle and Iron Eagle 2 was the man who made Iron Eagle, then there can be no question as to the fact that he has made his own sequels. If you know of someone who had a first sequel, I think you should give them a call if they are still alive. I think it is extremely unlikely that someone would be interested in making a sequel.|0
Yeah , a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction . Now it 's a prison again . And you can see more prisoners than you can ever see on the outside of your cell . I don 't mind , it is fun to look at . There is lots of work to do . I don 't get out much anymore . I don 't mind , I am glad to get out . I guess I can see the prison in a way . It 's still there , and I see more than the rest of you here . I just wish we could go back to normal .|0
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and vote with them. And I’m so pleased that so many of you did. Thanks again to all of you who made this movie such a memorable and worthwhile viewing experience. This movie is so much more than a standard thriller. It is also a romance, a western, a period piece, a historical drama, and even an action thriller, if you like that last one, which IMDb did not bother to do.|0
Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that.|1
"Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film , the other two being Ozu and Nakajima, who are considered the founding fathers of Hollywood in the late 1920s and 1930s respectively. His films have been called ""classic Japanese films of the 20th century,"" ""the first Japanese movies,"" ""the masters,"" and ""the films of a lost generation."" He is the first person in Japanese history to win the Kodansha Manga Award and the first person to win an award for a full-length anime film."|0
I awarded this presentation 4 stars . They are all for the script , which has been butchered beyond recognition. It’s all just a set up to make you believe that something important will happen at a specific time, and the writers are not even thinking about the consequences of this plot . They just have a script that the producers want you to take a look at and enjoy. If you’re like me and are in the dark, you may well go back to your book or movie or whatever you are watching . You’re not even reading the scripts or watching the movie.|0
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois , recently released from prison for theft , as he undertakes the theft of a gold shipment with a crew consisting of a couple of bums and an assortment of thugs. The film’s tagline of “A Little Crime, A Big Payback” was not an exaggeration, for not only is Le Stephanoi involved in a crime, he’s done it before. He’s been convicted and served a year in prison for stealing from a bank. He’s also been at it again, and in fact, he stole from a different bank.|0
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV , try watching him on youtube, because that’s what he is all about. He loves to share his knowledge about Indian culture, and his videos are full of cultural and historical insights that you can find on YouTube. It is important to note that his name, Reshammi, is the Hindi word for “Respected”. So it is very interesting to watch his videos when he is discussing the topic of Indian Culture, history, and history in India, and Indian history in India.|0
"What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works' themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim ""strangling the boy for the purity of his scream"".You can't fault Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality."|1
But it 's not . The plot is n't all that bad , the actors are n't all terrible so why . What is the point in the first place ? What makes the plot interesting ? And it is the same for all the other books by the same author. They are good stories , but what makes them memorable is the characters . They are real and deep . They are flawed . They make you laugh , and make you cry. The author is good . The story is good . And the characters are real and deep.|0
OK, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I turn to to fill in the time. I have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, I knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolf in Paris or London than I would watch those movies.|1
"I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish ""Origin of Species"". Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life."|1
"If you 're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies ( I guess it 's kind of like watching bad horror movies ) - you probably already know that they're called "" horror "" movies. This week 's list is for a horror movie from the 80's, in fact it's one of the last ones from the 90's and I guess the first one I saw, in theaters. I've seen most of these movies and I'd like to put them here because they're great and they make a lot of history."|0
Although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days.|1
This was Gene Kelly 's breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable . Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest ( and lover ), and you have a masterpiece of film noir . But the movie is also an homage to a very different time in American life. Kelly is no stranger to movies that center around the Depression era. In fact, the movie he made about the Depression era may have had some similarities to the movie that he made before about the Great Depression. The difference? Kelly went out of his way to make sure he was able to pay homage to that time period .|0
Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim.|1
This film is absolutely appalling and awful. It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art. The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this film.|1
"I absolutely love the first three movies , they were great ! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, I thought that was the last time I would see him, it's not! If anyone is interested in Part 5, please email me, it may take some time to arrange. __________________""It's easy to sit around a campfire. It's hard to ride a bike""

I'm really happy about the movie, I was really worried that it was going to suck (it does) but I think it's really great."|0
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors , Christopher Nolan was a master . Nolan is certainly the master in what he did to Batman , but the real genius of his work, and the reason his film stands alongside the greats of cinema , is in what he did not do , not with his film but with how it was done . His film, ‘‘Batman’’, had a couple of very interesting moments but there were some really stupid choices made in the story of the film.|0
"Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering the ranch house with an unusual ability. She is possessed by an entity, known as ""the Devil"". Isabelle soon develops a strong bond with the boy who is staying at the house. As Isabelle gets closer to revealing herself as the Devil's spirit, she becomes convinced that the boy is the Devil. After some time in bed with the boy at her ranch, Isabelle begins to realize that she has lost touch with her human side."|0
"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin."|1
Acting 10 , Script 1 . `` Hurlyburly '' is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared the end of all theatricality as a stagecraft. In '' Hurlyburly ' ', the audience, in the first act , of this play, is treated to the most unspeakable tableau. I think I may have said the same thing. I do, but I've been too busy lately with work and other things, and I haven't been watching the series. I should. Last night when I got home (after the performance), I went down to the basement.|0
"This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on . This movie is practically McHale 's Law, a film about how you never have to pay your rent. This is the first film I've ever seen that was a satire on the whole mortgage situation. This isn't a ""what the hell are you doing making a movie!"" type of film. Instead, this film is really about how much your life is worth, and what it means for you to live in a society that values money over people."|0
"This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.We see little long-haired Jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (I guess poor Jack attained the wrong kind)."|1
"I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line ""I poked her with a stick. ""The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, dumb one."|1
"A man kicks a dog 2' in the air.A woman kicks a cow out of her bed.A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.A woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.A man kicks a blind man in the stomach.Jesus rapes a young girl.There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this ""shocking vanguard of cinematic expression"" would appeal. But I found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade."|1
Hellraiser : Bloodline is only a so-so film . I believe it 's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I do believe the last movie was the one with the 3rd part movie and the 2nd part part 1 and part 2. I've heard that the 2nd part part 3 film is not good . __________________The most important thing is how you treat those who you love the most. A man who lives by his sword is a dead man to all who approach him with a sword. I have been waiting for this film to come out for over 5 years and it finally was released last month.|0
"If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed her name as a ""headliner"". I picked it up thinking, ""Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!"" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie."|1
"I do n't really know why so many persons love this movie : maybe it 's funny , OK , maybe it 's a bit boring , OK , but I love the movie soo much! It was the best film I've seen in the last years and I am happy I found it

It is not funny. It is actually quite sad. It is an emotional film with great acting. The film tells a lot about the
loss of a loved one and shows the struggle between humanity and the
grief, anger and sorrow of a family that loses someone very important to
them."|0
This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule.|1
"""Ghost Son"" is Lamberto Bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. It's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title."|1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan . If you have not seen a Cronenberg movie before then you will need a refresher on how he works and he is a master of this craft. You may have seen his “Tales From The Crypt” series and he really is not afraid to make the audience uncomfortable and get them talking. In his first film I did not think that the movie did a great job and this one does not look as good as “The Brood” but I enjoyed it and I hope you will too, so sit back, relax and take a breath.|0
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
I usually don't categorize a moving as boring. I am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. Unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. Terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience.|1
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge . Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of mercenaries hired to fight in a Star Wars themed tournament. It's really fun and has a strong sense of humor. The movie is set to be released on September 18, 2015 in the United States, the UK and the European Union. The film will also be released in Japan. Watch it on Netflix and you'll get the full length version, as well as a new bonus feature titled The Best of Robert Urich: Episode 1: The Final Countdown.|0
"As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many over dramatizations in ""made for TV movies"" and the craziness of the reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience.I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict."|1
"Christian Propaganda ... Lots of fear mongering ... This is not SciFi , this is ChriFi ( Christian fiction )

The book is a work of fiction but it's a very realistic book . I'm not saying this because I like the book , it's more about the message that the book conveys . The book is very well written , I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the Gospel and see for themselves the true meaning of what the Bible is really teaching . Here's a little bit about me . I'm from Colorado , I'm a pastor and evangelist for over 15 years ."|0
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened & you will too. It's a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.|1
"Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. The one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the IMDb.I found ""What Alice Found"" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that I have seen this year. It's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing?"|1
I really do n't think producer George Lucas did n't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as The Force Awakens. What's even worse is how many people have tried to blame Lucas for the horrible story. Here is just one example of the ridiculousness of the debate going on. I don't recall there being any debate when Lucas first suggested that the new trilogy would be based on a prequel story. He even had a bit of a cameo appearance in The Phantom Menace as an old man. It's almost as if people don't get it.|0
I cant go for long describing this tittle , simply because I do not feel strong about it . I do not see why I should be interested in writing this, but it is true, i am interested , and you know , if it were me , I would want to put it in my resume and make sure I got the job . So , why should i write this , if i don't think it can help ? I think it is not going to make me rich, so that is not my concern . But it is going to make me happy.|0
Since I 'd bought the DVD , I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of curiosity and enjoyment. But I do not plan to buy it again . I had some issues with the story and characters as I am sure others will have as well, but I was very impressed by how I felt about all the people and how the story unfolded . If you enjoy this type of film then I highly suggest you watch it . I have only watched 2 of the films so I will be adding a review soon but I did enjoy all of the characters.|0
"This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome.Any movie that preaches about the ""one true god"" gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism."|1
Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar . One of Hollywood 's handsome leading men . Married to one of the all-time most beautiful actresses on earth, and the father of nine . But John Agar had something he wasn't expecting. The woman he thought was all he had to give. And it was all gone. He had no idea who it was that he was sleeping with. No idea what they had done behind her back. No idea how she had found out. And the best thing she did was get him to pay attention to what was really going on with his life.|0
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let 's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, and have it be based on a TV show from the 90s called Dexter. It will be fun to watch a guy who is obsessed with serial killers. 2.I get that they'd like to use Dexter's methods and methods from other fictional characters, but I don't know why they can't do it in a movie. It seems like they want to do it, but I think they're doing it just to annoy me. I know they will make the movie eventually.|0
Spoiler with plot explanation: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy (that pops out from nowhere, and no questions asked... ) that went wacko, and Casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death. With every frame movie gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending seams completely dumb, it has nothing to od with the movie itself, i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s**t this way or other, so it may as well have a stupid ending.|1
"I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one more season. But when the end came closer I was exited to see that. And what did we get? This episode called ""NOT FADE AWAY"" was the very last one.I was so disappointed by this episode. This is absolutely the worst way to this series. Why couldn't it get a happy ending? Why did have a few of the main characters to die? Why did Angel not become a human and was reunited with Buffy again? No."|1
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric , shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response . This is the kind of film where you feel like you’re being led by a blind pony down a dark, twisty alley with no other light than the glowing red of the film itself. In Fingers, we follow two high-school friends who are stuck with each other for the duration of most of their summer, and who are trying to complete an online dating service. This is not to suggest that it is a bad movie, in fact, you will likely enjoy it.|0
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar . Its so nice to see this wonderful little studio getting back into the business with this fantastic series. The story, acting, animation, cinematography and production values are all really quite good. If you enjoy the works of these animators then this series is just the ticket to get the most out of your time with your children. But, you have to remember that its a series of animation not a film. I think its really good to see the older studio back into the business with these series.|0
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff.|1
I saw `` Sweeney Todd '' on Broadway in 1980 . It starred George Hearn and featured most of the actors in the cast who would be seen on Broadway and on television later in that century. I thought it a great show. And I thought the music was fine, especially in the finale . But I have always been reluctant to see the film version . For some reason . When I saw the film in 1999 I had the feeling . . I didn't know it at that time . . it was like being in the presence of God .|0
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse , the acting or the story? I really enjoyed this movie but not for the reasons people think it is... its hard to judge an action film when the acting is so bad! But I liked that the film does not take itself too seriously. The acting in the movie is pretty terrible, especially Davies who is not too bad at it, but his acting in the film seems so forced that I don't want to watch the film again.|0
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable , the giant Zeus . Network President Kevin Gable and co-promoter Scott Steiner, who have worked together for 12 years , were recently at a press conference where they announced the start of the first ever “Tower of Zeus” show , which will be aired on January 15th on the WWE Network . The official description of what is being offered on the program is: “The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) debut show of the most fearsome monster in the world!|0
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by Hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities.|1
"Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the ""wasted talents"" expression. I had never EVER seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein,and so on). The ""aging"" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. The use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that I could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly."|1
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980's version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. Although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes, though.|1
"I'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new ""Doctor who"" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or BBC America; from season one we are introduce to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled last name sorry)."|1
I 'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with , but how did this seem to happen, is there any real information about what caused this, if it is related to any of the things I can find out about , what are your thoughts. I don't think this is some sort of big conspiracy by a small group , I think this has to have been an inside job , but that doesn't mean that the person(s) involved did it on purpose , even with the information I have at my disposal it is still a mystery.|0
Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.|1
"""The Bone Snatcher"" starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen, and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well."|1
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature.|1
Set in the Philipines , Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop get his butt kicked by some pretty nasty opponents. I have to be honest, I really enjoyed Lethal. I’d even argue that it is a better movie than I remembered from my childhood. That said, I would have enjoyed it more, if the movie hadn’t gone on for too long. I have always felt that Lethal was overrated on this list, and now I think I’d go as far to say that this was the film that started me going full-on into movies.|0
"I walked into Blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: ""Panicky kidnapped girlfriend"" (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!)"|1
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many but I'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say I like 'em, especially Guts of a Beauty (aka Entrails of a Beautiful Woman). Watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and I was surprised how well it actually went over.Entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of Asia (specifically Japan in this case).|1
Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .Corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . Ed Nelson a very competent actor got started with Corman as well as many other favorites who show up in Superman and many of the westerns of the day . The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it .|1
OK , last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader 's The Exorcist : The Beginning at the American Theatre in London. While I don't usually watch this film I had to see it. I have to admit that I didn't watch it through the lens of my Christian views but rather with the perspective of a non-theistic, non-churchgoer. So what I saw was not that different than what you would find in a Christian church on Sunday. You have the usual suspects in the congregation and it's just a movie about demonic possession, demon possession and how to get rid of the demon.|0
The original `` Psycho '' ( 1960 ) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock 's best work and certainly , for most of his life, the greatest thriller in the history of cinema. It was Hitchcock 's first feature film , directed by Robert Siodmak , in 1957. Hitchcock wrote the film's screenplay , from his novel The Manchurian Candidate (1937), and the movie was the first of three feature films made by Hitchcock. The first film Hitchcock produced was 1962's Vertigo , a film that also has the distinction of being the last of Hitchcock's films made with a script by James Whale .|0
"Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said , customs are changed to make the plot work out better -- the actors don't always get to tell a real story (not that you'd know about it) and there are many movies that are just a bunch of people acting out what's on their minds . They're all about ""what's on the mind"" of the writer/director and ""what the hell happened last night?"" is the first question he or she would ask

I must be honest and say I'm not much of a film fan."|0
"Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed ""The Guardian"". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible."|1
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard . For something made by an eighteen year old in New York during the time of the Cold War, it’s actually quite good . The only problem, as a few have pointed out , is the ending . I think they did a good job of tying together all the strands that were being thrown together. And they made sure to make it a movie that wasn’t just about the Cold War . In fact , there was a point to it , and there was a reason why it was important , and they did their job well .|0
Mixed group of `` experts '' ( explorers , divers and scientists ) venture a mile underground and go another half hour in the dark , where they take on a very real challenge . The team will face challenges ranging from claustrophobia ( because it is not light , or at least not light enough ) to the ability to find water , and a whole lot more . The group will face some real and some not so real, but we think they are well worth facing . One of the real challenges will be the water, especially if it is contaminated with chemicals such as bromoform .|0
I attended a screening of this movie . It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups and so on . I was not impressed as it turned into the same type of thing that has happened to many of us over the years. There were also several people who showed up who couldnt even get into the movie as it turns into such an awful ordeal for people who want to see a movie . I was really impressed by the whole movie though , but I feel like it should have been at least an hour longer . The cast was alright for a movie like this .|0
"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, but only humans have them? I mean, I don’t really expect you to take this seriously, but I’ve got my own idea of how I think this would work out:

I think the aliens would beam a laser at a person’s face, the person would take cover behind a large rock (or something), and a spaceship would land on the rock, or something. The person is then exposed to laser fire from the alien ships and would die."|0
Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, I was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. It wasn`t just Bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. Add to that a plot liken to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as I`m concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I taped it.|1
This was a excellent movie . I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was an eye opening experience for me. It was funny, it made me feel good and I found myself laughing out loud after every scene. It’s a film with a lot to offer that I haven’t had a chance to see. It really is a comedy, but at the same time it has an emotional heart to it that I think will be hard for me to put into words.|0
"A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of the last sales that they were having on video game releases. While there we came upon a box that I knew would make an appearance when it did. It was a box full of the new God Eater and it had a nice little sticker on the back. The sticker read, ""To be used once per character only."" That's when I realized that these stickers were made specifically to be placed on a box with God Eater, rather than any of the other games they have on shelves."|0
A rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later? ), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...It's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due.|1
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home I raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie Finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas Gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie.|1
"I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was I in for the surprise ? Well let me be honest I thought I was , I was so pleasantly surprised to read that you had actually enjoyed it, so I am very happy to hear this, I will certainly be doing my best to see your next film and hope you enjoy it,

Well let me start by saying I wasn't expecting much, after reading your reviews I thought you had a bit of a dislike of it."|0
Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD.|1
"I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was a major reason why. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the ""straight"" role instead of the funny guy. ""Armed and Dangerous"" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter."|1
"There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you have some idea of what these two are like. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once."|1
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine.|1
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours . The only thing that saves this film are the great cinematography skills of the film makers, who use a lot of close ups for emphasis. Unfortunately the acting is a bit too melodramatic and the script is too slow for this to be anything else. The end result is that you wish that you hadn’t watched it. If you have been following me on my journey of discovery on the blog, then you are probably aware that I have a penchant for documentaries.|0
"I love Ustinov 's distinctive , literate narration . And the photography is quiet nice . We put the film on the shelf and never go there again . Not a fan of the plot . And it doesn't really make a lot of sense . But you watch . It's worth . I like to see more than just the ""what did you see and do not like"" of movies . I like to know who did it , what it's about, who is making it , etc.. I don't expect to see every movie but I do expect to know a little bit more than what you saw."|0
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA . No guesswork here . A giant CGI robot comes to life and battles a series of tiny, yet massive, robot warriors, each armed to the teeth and capable of anything. These creatures, each about as big as a two-car garage door opener, can fire laser blasts and other weapons from anywhere within range. In the first battle between COBRA AND KOMODO, you'll be tasked with sending the robot in a certain direction. As you do so, it will fire a series of laser blasts at the enemy robots.|0
Two actors play rival gangsters in three films , the final of which is a sci-fi film , that nods towards the classic gangster movies of the 1940s . In addition, there are some classic gangster action scenes . The movie begins with the police car racing up the freeway, which is followed by a slow-mo chase in the desert, and a chase in the mountains . The chase then switches back to the freeway and ends with an all-out race through the streets of San Francisco. The chase and car races continue, and eventually the chase gets into San Jose and ends in the desert.|0
"*some possible spoilers*Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the ""harmless"", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay."|1
"Finally ! Other people who have actually seen this show ! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen ! It is very funny and it is an anime that I like to watch ! The first time I watched this show I thought to myself, ""I am going to hate it."" After watching the first episode I was not disappointed but I did laugh at some places. It was a very good anime that has a good message and I really like it. I hope I can watch more episodes ! I think it's worth the price of a watch."|0
This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt, ring true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even though it is right for the story, because I had already come to care about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber work all around, even to the use of just the right sound and/or music to advance the story.|1
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. A film worse than the postman,sizzle Beach U.S.A, Batman and Robin, Kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. I do hope that Troma or someone in America would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the French stench at it's worth.|1
"The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan. After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the ""key to the universe"" that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about. Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. Each has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. All of the actors give great performances."|1
"There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. It was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. Compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. I kept thinking ""it must get better."" It got worse. And worse. How on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews I see of people actually loving the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad."|1
It really is a great film ( after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to have been going for) although the film really is too long, and not really worth sitting through, with too much of a story being told at once, and the film does end in a rather unsatisfying way, with little closure. I think a film of this sort could be enjoyed by anyone, but I think there is a lot of patience that would be required for this type of film. This review contains spoilers, click show to reveal the ending.|0
A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets , created by Jim Henson & Co , have been made , and some are being made into full-length animated films. I decided to write a little about what I’ve learned so far about making them, along with my observations . . . I am currently working on making a movie about one of the Muppet movies, the one based on Kermit & Miss Piggy , in which I will be working with Jim Henson Co. ( Jim Henson Associates , the company created the Muppets ) on this project.|0
"I won't spoil it for you. Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what I mean after you watch it) Poor story. B-rated movie quality. Typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. I should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add ""quotes"". Just tells me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. I wish I could take back the time I spent watching this."|1
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! i waste my time watching this film because of the plot and not because i love it, it is very boring in all respects. i don't mind watching it for entertainment but this one i think it was made on purpose to make money. I loved this film. I had seen it twice on video and it did not ruin my night watching it. It was the 3rd time this movie was shown in my house. I really enjoyed the movie.|0
"It 's just when a band tours , and only has one original member . It 's not the same band that came before . There is no new material . Just more of the same . I know this because I saw one of the albums on tour. It was a bad album . Not only was it poorly made , it was not very good . There were only 4 songs in it . It was a joke . One of the songs in there was a song called "" I Will Survive"" that was supposed to be the debut song . It was actually a joke ."|0
"With a name like ""10 Commandments"" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark-made film. Remember ""Noah""?? That was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had ""some"" truth to the original story. However, Menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated."|1
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It 's a good movie , looking at after war , psychical problem , a very interesting concept , but the script is really hard to read, i just couldn't keep going through the whole thing !!!!!! i have just about read the whole thing , i can't stop going through it !!!!! !!!!!!! I agree that it is hard to read. I read the first book and then started on the sequels. I couldn't finish the series either.|0
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half . Few plot twists are revealed, most are hidden from view, and the end result is an unsatisfying and boring movie that fails on every level. The writing is great, but the acting is horrible. The story is so bad it makes even the worst films from Hollywood look bad. The film starts off with a pretty good introduction as we meet the young girl, Rachel (Brianna Foster), and the creepy man in the hospital.|0
"Definitely worth renting ! Good clean family entertainment . My 4 and 5 year-olds ( and I ) loved it ! I wish I could rent to watch it over the weekend. Stayed: February 2013, travelled as a result of a work trip

I have been coming to this resort every year for the past 11 years, it has been one of the best places in town to be. I love it. The service I recieved was second to none. The food is great."|0
As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs , `` Gag me out the door . '' I would not say this with a grin. It is a sad statement, a sad statement with a bitter twist. When I heard that I could have my say as soon as possible, I knew what I would do. A few nights ago, a woman came to me and said she wanted me to gag her so she could have her say. I said, `` Gag me out the door. That's a nice way to talk to a woman.''|0
"It's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: ""Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget."""|1
Low budget , but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. I can't remember if they filmed it in black and white, so we're still looking for that. I was so excited to see this film. I like to think I know what all of this is about. This story of a person who goes off the grid and has to come back out of it. That is the story my parents are telling me. I want to hear that story. I want my father to tell his mother.|0

There is four if there is four, but three if there is three. Two is four, there are three to five. There are two if there is three.

There are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and SHEPHERED is one of those movies which should have been a must watch from the first time you watched a movie. This movie has a message to the younger generation and also to the older generations too. The story is not very complicated. There is a young girl named Shoshana. She is from a small village, where she lives in a house with her parents, her sisters and her younger brother. She has dreams about going to study abroad in a distant land.|0
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. The shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.The central performance from Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.The cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films.|1
As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow just lost that. I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too.|1
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie...but it isn't Pinhead, he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird, and the worse...he talk too much.|1
As kids movie it is great . For the family it just sucks . I was truly hoping for something like this with a more realistic story with real characters and not like the Disney’s live action films . This film will probably appeal to older teens , and younger teens who love action and are interested in seeing what happens after the explosion in the first act when they see all of the debris. This film has great potential for kids , but if they watch it , they are going to have to pay close attention and take the movie very seriously.|0
"I do n't know which was worse , the viewer 's made dopes of , or the stars in this case,

and , I really dont know which of those dopes to call a fanboy , but , it really makes no sense , to me at all , to see stars do this , with the sole purpose , that the viewer 's fans would like to see them do it . the whole point , of the entire thing , is just to draw attention to stars , to have the audience think that they can do anything , that the viewer 's fans can do anything , that anyone can do anything ."|0
I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences . I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact is a good idea to start with the movie to find what is going on and maybe that will give us some insight on what to expect in the future.I know the movie is a good idea, but I think it's not as important as that it is the first film to tell the true story of the life of the man you love so that we can understand where he was coming from, why he felt like he needed to do this and was able to give us the real story.|0
"Why bother, ITV? Admittedly, Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to ""get,"" and Fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... If one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. And for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast Fanny as she was written: A prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! Mrs. Norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. And what the heck happened to Portsmouth?"|1
"You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie . . ."" He paused and then continued. ""I mean, of course, it would have worked. If you had told the audience it was a pirate adventure, that they were being transported to a pirate adventure with pirates in it, they'd have loved it. It wouldn't make them angry, because they wouldn't like it. But they'd definitely hate it."" I didn't know what to say so I just nodded and said nothing."|0
1) Bad acting.2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.3) Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows up so early. The escape ship also got sunk too fast.|1
"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation."|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I watched episodes, I didn't get too into the show. As I became a teenager I had to watch Doctor Who at least once a week. I thought the show was a bit cheesy but I didn't think that it was that bad, at all. When you've watched an entire Doctor Who series over the course of three or so years, it's almost impossible to not think that something is wrong with the show.|0
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious ""star"" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity."|1
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!)|1
This movie sucks so bad. Its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained American twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. As for the bit where they make the French President drink 'bad water', that was just lame.|1
Wow , did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise ! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, it suddenly gets the power of an inter-dimensional super-carrier, and then has to make a course correction that ends up with her crashing into an asteroid field ? What the hell was going on ? And that was just one episode !! The Enterprise was not only on the right side of a war, but it was on the side of the Federation! And then she crashed into an asteroid field. And that's basically all it did !!|0
If you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating... but I cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way Paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad the way Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life?|1
"The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934 . I purchased this because I like desert comical sketches. This is one of the very first, though it does get better after a while. I bought the DVD, but I don't think I ever saw the show, so I can't confirm. I do know, though, that there are plenty of films of this show that are good, and this was no exception. There are two reasons why I don't recommend it:
1. It is quite badly acted, to say the least, in spite of the title."|0
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases , we decided to get it despite the fact that we were not fans of the game, we liked the game more than they did and wanted to have a go at it, but we quickly realised that the only reason that it was released at all was because of the game and not for us. If we did see it on Steam, I would not have paid for it then, but it would be a totally different game than what we have been treated to.|0
"It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman."|1
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but ""the"" icon for good-doers all over the world. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.Whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over Mr. Moore's treatment."|1
this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far. i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes....'9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated.|1
"I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic ""Forbidden Planet,"" Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine a sailor? ), even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I guess he was a red herring, like Pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank."|1
I rented this one by accident . I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought `` I have no idea where this came from, I don't even know what is happening in that room . It is a horror movie on the surface, but as far as I could tell the people in it are people that I would know , and I wonder if they are the ones who are haunting me . Maybe this will help me find the source of this video ? This is by far my favorite horror movie I've ever seen, and one of the best I saw on VHS!|0
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful ; it was pointless and just plain stupid . the movie ends with a huge fight. I am sure it is based on fact, but the movie has no connection to the true events that took place in the real world. I saw the movie because it was in the theater in New York. This movie is nothing but an excuse to continue to watch movies about people fighting in the movie theater, or on television, or even on the internet. It is so boring.|0
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...Actually, it is. It's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story.|1
"This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime

I love this movie! I'm going to start this thread to give my love and support to any who are watching this movie. It is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a Christian, and this movie is blasphemous against God, so I thought I would not like it at all, but I have seen it and it was just so bad. If you can get over it, then you should give this movie a try, even if it is blasphemous."|0
Here is a movie of adventure , determination , heroism , & bravery . Plus , it 's set back about a year in time . So . I think it 'll give you the time it deserves . But . I do think it will be worth the time . Just watch and enjoy . This is another film by a very talented director. I believe it' s very well written , and that 's why I've decided to watch it as soon as I have finished this film review . But . it is quite difficult to find the review .|0
"That is the answer. The question is: What is the single reason to watch this movie? I loved her in ""My Name Is Julia Ross."" That is one of the best films noir of all time. Noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. That would be ""The Guilt Of Janet Ames."" This one has a spooky, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a fine director. I was expecting something dark."|1
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, like I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK since I like to express my own opinions quite frequently. If something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. This gives me yet another chance to take my shots at ""The Departed"". When one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful."|1
Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc.|1
"Piper , Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Fiend. When he gets there, Piper and Phoebe find him in the kitchen. Piper, after seeing him, says ""I'm not leaving him. We need to save him."" When the two go into the bedroom, Dr. Griffiths tells Phoebe that he is going to kill his wife. Phoebe then tries to stop the fiend, but is unsuccessful. She then decides to help the others in saving Dr. Griffiths, but the fiend starts to get angry and tries to harm the boys."|0
Great subject matter , director , and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film , told in that way that the best thing to ever happened to horror. If you have the patience , this is the film to catch. I'm a bit biased here, and I'm not sure if this film deserved a theatrical release. This is the kind of movie that should be made available for digital download. I was disappointed with this one, too. It feels like it wasn't written by the people who make horror. It feels like there was no effort to create tension or tension of any kind.|0
Take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? Something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing.Seven Alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film.The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere.|1
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt like it was about one hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie.|1
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics.|1
Don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. It is, but that, does not a good film, make.Comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series being another example).The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh.|1
Everyone knows that late night movies are n't Oscar contenders . Fine . I mean I 'll admit that I was a huge fan of Jaws. But I would argue the same for Night of the Monster Man . I don't know what kind of monster I was expecting , it was one of those movies where everyone gets scared when they first see it , but then they get it . I'm glad I gave Night of the Monster Man a chance , because I think it did quite well . Here is the trailer.|0
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before?|1
I tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't sit well with me. Although the performances are good, the writing isn't. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we're supposed to side with Casey, given that she's the protagonist, but I don't find her at all likable. The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable.|1
"""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.It's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual ""good wife"" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player."|1
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card.|1
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings , but that is n't saying much.The plot is very entertaining and well thought out . If you enjoy fantasy and sci fi then you should enjoy this series. I know the first season is done, but it was a very entertaining ride with a very good cast. I haven't been able to watch the first season, and I really hope that it's not cancelled. I'm a big SyFy fan (a lot of this series is based off my own works and some of the characters) and have been thinking about buying the series on Blu-ray.|0
"I really tried to like ""Saw."" The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were too many clichés and elements that while they may have looked ""cool,"" they really made no sense.First, what I liked about the film was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife."|1
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see. It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one. Even thou I'm not interested in football I wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up.|1
"I 'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival . It is a shallow film with a predictable story that doesn 't do anything original."" It has also been described as ""one of the worst movies"" of 2007. Home media 
The DVD and VCD was released on October 21, 2008 in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment and the film is now available to watch on Amazon.com. The Blu-ray version was released on September 19, 2010 by Universal Home Entertainment in the United States and on January 25, 2011 by Warner Home Entertainment in Europe."|0
The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters?|1
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously.|1
This movie was everything but boring . It deals with reality . To the people who think this movie was good , just think of this . This is not a horror film to make your audience jump . This is a film that tells the story of ordinary people facing a terrible problem . This movie is about life and death . In the last 15 years , this movie has been seen by about 50 million people and this was the first film that used this concept . The story is told in two parts . In the first half , we meet a young boy named Daniel who is in his early years .|0
* * * SPOILERS * * * Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen , Sandy and Bill are an interesting pair who have been together for the past fifteen years. When she is widowed in 1819, she gives up everything she has worked for so that her children may live on, but all that changes after she meets a young lawyer with a promising career in London, and is given the name of ‘Frances Austen’, it seems she is the real deal when she returns to Yorkshire. But as the new year comes it is evident that love is not so easily found.|0
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who dally with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually come up short. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.|1
"Allegedly the ""true story"" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same who funded Columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke Philip of Austria, known as ""The Handsome"" (and played in a rather unispired manner by Italian hunk Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). This is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. It drips destructive lust from start to finish."|1
"It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no ""Look at me Kimmy!"""|1
As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars.|1

Here are a few more reasons why you should be following Rita Hayworth, aka the Cover Girl. . . or is it the Cover Girl . . . in a different movie, no less? . . . • Rita is starring in this summer's movie, ' Rocky III , which hits theaters on August 31st.|0
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell stuff on my own and with some good friends. Two years later I did some stills with a friend of mine. He was a photographer who had been working for another agency. I was introduced to him when he came to me for some photos. The first time I worked with him he was in Greece. I went to Greece in August and met this guy I didn't know and he told me a lot of stories. I met Jim Salter again in Greece.|0
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus the death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola.|1
I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome . I am not an expert in the genre of movies but I can tell the movie is not a typical comedy. It has a serious tone. You will not get this kind of entertainment in a lot of movie theaters but you will find this movie at cinemas and on DVD and BluRay . So I was quite curious to see how it will turn out, and I was glad I waited for the movie night to come to a close . I have a feeling that I am in for an interesting adventure.|0
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects."|1
This is a haunting short film . Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt , ring true and have a powerful message for today. We are all a product of our past. We all do the things we have done in the past, that we want to do now, but we have done these things so many times, that it has become normal and we can do it with ease. We can make a difference , we can make a change. I believe that we all have the ability to make the world a better place, by making our own choices.|0
It kicks you in the stomach . There are other films with more convincing characters , a more realistic story with a strong emotional core , but still , there are so many movies in which the whole plot is just so unbelievable . So, why is it so important to know what is happening before you decide to see it ? Well, sometimes it may not feel that way , and it may be hard to tell you why you should or should not see a certain movie. But, here is the list of the movies which could have made this list of the best movies you can watch.|0
This movie was outright painful for me to watch. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. First off, jump cuts. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. Secondly, the dialog.|1
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the ""River's Edge"", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy."|1
I was just lucky I found this movie . I 've been taking advantage of Walmart 's $ 5.50 DVDs, but this is just as good. The plot is just as good. The only problem I have is that they don't put much detail on how this movie was made and not much in regards to why. There is only one trailer and one trailer. I would love to see more if that is even possible. I have to say that I have seen the first movie in theaters, but just didn't think it was really worth the $5.50.|0
Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest.|1
This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding Singer'. Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is all about metal.Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll!|1
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich , and the setting unusual and interesting . But I wasn't sure about it. It had a great premise but the execution wasn't all that great. The acting was lacking and the script was confusing . This was the first film I ever watched and I've never been disappointed in a film I saw. But I really do wish they had put some effort to the writing of this one, because if it was up to me, it would have been one of the best action scenes of the year.|0
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film . It is apparent that not one person was able to review it properly or had a strong opinion on the movie . There were even times where I found some of the comments and reviews completely unfair to the film . Even though this film is very well made and there is much to like and admire it has come under a lot of scrutiny . I will do my best to give it a fair review . Even though I feel a lot of people are being unfair on this film .|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter.|1
Yep, it's me again! Mr 'I sit through crap so you don't have to'.What do you think this is about? Could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant DA to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to?|1
"The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and Bernstein's rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts ""II"" and ""III"" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces."|1
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap.|1
Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie -- who woulda thought ? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed but I'm so excited to see what he brings to this next movie in this long overdue trilogy. I also think he is one of the best new directors to come through Hollywood since the great John Waters in the early 80's. He has so much passion and is willing to go as far as it takes to create great films. I have seen the first two Estevez movies and there is much I like about them but I still feel the need to watch it again to truly appreciate it.|0
"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good."|1
The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics . While the theme seems common , many have felt that it lacks focus . I do not have to agree with you . That is why I will attempt to find a way of making it relevant and even interesting . I will not make it too long , I feel that the theme will end up being somewhat predictable . This is why I will try and make it more fun . It should be noted that I am not making any political comment . It is simply an expose , but I hope that I can make it interesting .|0
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!|1
Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it.|1
"I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham , AL , which was actually a really great show. The only thing I wasn't sure about at the time was why the plot was set on a school trip, which was really interesting. The film had great performances and was really well directed. I highly recommend seeing it! 1 comment:

Well I saw this last weekend. It was great, I really like the concept for it. I'm curious though, where was it filmed and in what city?"|0
* * * SPOILERS * * * This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly THE WORST movie you can watch this year, and if you don’t catch the movie you’re missing out! The film itself has about 8% of it’s running time. If you’ve been watching the trailers and you want the plot, then it should be pretty straight forward. But it’s just a lot of plot holes. If you want the plot, then you’re better off sticking to the trailer, or reading the synopsis for the book and googling.|0
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released . All these years later at age 76 , I have not seen a movie with a better ending, nor have I had a better response from a lot of people. I am just glad I saw it and that it made a difference in my life. I am not so sure I would have survived this long. But I will always believe the movie did have some good things to say about life, death, the way we all go about our lives and how it impacts us.|0
"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow ""transplant"" donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever."|1
Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of Life. By the end of 19th century in a remote Japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than he, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. Henceforth in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man.|1
Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film.|1
"I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. Turns out I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this motion picture like Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds to being a burnout. Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW). Like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention!"|1
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I ca n't believe that the writer and director did n't see what the film was like in terms of budget and all. But they have to make a film like this and I don't blame them for the film. I just can't believe what I saw, it didn't seem realistic. It felt like the characters were there but didn't really exist, and the plot was just an illusion. The only good thing about it was that the movie had a plot that could be interpreted in a variety of ways, instead of just one.|0
"Love the TPB 's but this was a lame episode . Did n't have the same feel that the series had in its first few episodes. Spoiler! Show

There's nothing wrong with this show. It is a classic. I really enjoy watching this show, even if there are some annoying parts. It just gets annoying because the show is old and they have not done enough to improve it. Spoiler! Show

I liked the story and the characters. They did a great job. This is a very well made episode and I am glad I'm here."|0
I'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog. The film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight some more. There brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship.|1
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost £20 on ebay. Add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it.|1
Oh what the heck, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!Yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks!If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does.|1
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity . This was in the late 1950s, when he was one of the most powerful figures in the world of acting, a star of movies like ""The Godfather"", ""Serpico"" and ""Shanghai Noon"" and of stage plays including ""Romeo & Juliet"", ""Romeo & Juliet II"" and ""Romeo & Juliet III"" - which were all banned in the US in the early 1960s because of their use of profanity and violence."|0
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before.|1
1 . I 've seen Branaghs Hamlet : Branagh is too old , speaks frequently with a high pitched voice , but he has one good point . I think Branagh's Hamlet is one of the best plays of all time , and I think it ranks up there with Hamlet . I think a great actor would have made a better Hamlet . I do agree that Hamlet is a good play and the director would make a better Hamlet if he had a good Hamlet play on his hands . . I do not have any problem with Branagh . He did not have to change much for the part .|0
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy 's Scarlet Pimpernel books . Counting this one , I have about 15 of them , and I can't decide which would be best for me. It seems to me that she has done all she could to ensure her fans that there is no shortage of stories to read and the series will be ongoing . All I would ask is if anyone has read the first two books, and is willing to read this one, that it will not be a boring book .|0
In Brooklyn , the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in local clubs on the Sunset Strip, but she is caught between two men. After being arrested for public drunkenness, Parker becomes a prostitute, where she meets George ( Richard Egan), the owner of the club. There is a simple scene in the film in which Rusty is dancing with George, and she asks George how he got his job in the bar. He responds that he took lessons. Rusty then asks the question of how George got his job as a nightclub owner.|0
I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say : I was not impressed , not at all . The movie was not really good , I mean I felt it was not a good movie and the director of this movie really didn't like his script , I could not understand it and it made me feel bad . I mean really the only good thing in this movie is the story , the story line , I mean it was interesting and they did it well and it did it well , I mean how do they make a good story ?|0
Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm? !,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.|1
I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.The major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do.|1
People call a 976 `` party line '' to talk dirty to strangers , and perhaps meet up for a cup of coffee at the nearby cafe, but it's also a term used by many to refer to any long line of people waiting for something, whether it be a bus, a movie, or a meeting of some sort. So why do some people feel the need to take the extra step of creating the 976 in their own home? Here's a look at why a 976 is important, and how it can help you meet up with friends who may not know each other in real life.|0
To think this film was made the year I was born . To think people are still having their constitutional rights ignored. To think all those years I spent in detention are worth something. It has been a long time since I’ve been in a situation where people are actually afraid to use their constitutional rights. But I guess I should be thankful that this was the first time in a while that such a thing happened. It’s not like these rights are not important, or that I am not used to being afraid to use them, as you will find out in the following review.|0
I've never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid WWII historian, I don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean War bayonet lugs, K98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, German uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater.|1
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That's reason enough for me.She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. And said parties becoming drunken orgies.All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. And Emanuelle beds most of them.Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this one. He just ripped it off and used the same cast(s).|1
Yes sure , this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it . It makes sense when I think back to the olden times. My kids and grandkids have to see this and know what's going on. They should know where all of the bodies were buried and why. They should know that they died in a fire that was set by someone. They would think this was really stupid because they would be too afraid to think that they were alive. This is just plain stupid. Why? It makes sense that they would come to their senses.|0
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. Well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. But the F/X, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam(Kari Wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.|1
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) . For example , the first film by David Mamet , The Book Thief , and its sequel The Book Thief II ( with a new story ) were very good . But it was not a film , a novel , an idea , that was a real success . The film was actually a lot better than the first novel , because the original novel was written in the form of an autobiography , so the author did not have to describe his own life .|0
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction . I thought that it would be good for a few decent sci-fi movie plots, but I feel that it is not that well done. I have to admit that I really love it, as it was my very first movie that I watched and it was a great movie, and it is a good film in general. It is worth the watch. I am glad that it was made, as it is really good, but it is not my favorite movie that I watched in the last year.|0
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from series one, but by Jove it's worked.|1
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film . On its surface , the movie tells the story of a teenager named Kate, who travels to London to spend some time with a boy from her hometown. However , the film is not very well received , and I have heard that it has only been out for around a year before it was banned in Germany. The film was shot over a 12 day period in the summer of 2000 and was the first ever low-budget feature film to get banned by Germany .|0
I love pop culture , but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this . Then , I got one and it sounded pretty good . Then , I got two . I love it . Then , I got three . And , now , we've got our fourth . Now , you know me , so , you know that , when it comes to these things , this is where I go first . This is one of the things that I've always had in my back pocket . If it was something I had to take somewhere , I always just put it there .|0
Like the beauty of the jungle , Jessica Alba 's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film , and it looks like it won't hurt to try. That's why we are here. This is the movie to watch when you know nothing about Jennifer Lawrence. The actress has been in a bit of a scandal lately because of all the things going on in her life and what they mean to her. And now, the new film she has coming out on November 7th, she is going to finally get everything out in the open.|0
If you're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original, it's got some now. (Although I will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.)|1
"As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the ""Millennium"" series) and of course Lorenzo ""Renegade"" Lamas, I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film. Sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. Sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from Microsoft Flight Simulator.The cinematography sucks as well. Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look."|1
What crack are you smoking ? This movie , while gloriously entertaining , is awful ! The action scenes are too long , the jokes are dumb , the special effects are flat , the acting is horrible , the acting is horrible , the acting is awful ! There is only one reason why you are going to waste your precious time watching this , you will find it extremely boring . It is the only reason why I would not recommend this ! I would not waste my time watching it ! I would rather watch an action movie for a few weeks than watch this movie for more than 5 years !|0
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. At first i thought that it was going to be good because I'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. Next time the guys who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.|1
John Knowles modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, are one of many subtle, and subtly is the watch word, themes of love, hate, jealously, denial and regret. The 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - A love story with war looming in the background. The 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story. What is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes maybe it is arguable, a gay love story.|1
"With its rerelease by ADV Films, I've had a chance to watch ""The Giant Majin"" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!The sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant Majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!"|1
"Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor , but this is in a league of its own . it isn't just about being bad remakes of old films . this is about remaking movies that aren't really ""good"" at all . it is the worst remake of a ""good"" film in the last 20 years . now, we don't call this the worst remake , because that is ridiculous . it is the best remake of a film with zero stars . in fact , it is as good as the original , and even better ."|0
I 'd liked the Takashi Miike films I 'd seen so far , but I found this pretty disappointing . It's still fun , but not the way I expected . I liked it a lot . I thought the characters were interesting , and they all had their good points . But I thought that there were some weak points in the plot and in the acting . This is very much the way that I felt when watching movies in my early twenties , but in a better way than that. I 'm hoping that there is more to this .|0
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom drama True Detective, which is now available on HBO Max. While both films are set in the same time period, there are notable differences. While True Detective follows a trial, The Postman is told by a newspaper journalist. Both films offer a different take on police work. It’s not that they aren’t similar. They are. When I first saw True Detective, I really wanted to see The Postman.|0
"This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about ""God"" and ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.AVOID IT!"|1
"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general ( I 'm not sure why -- I know that some people have great ideas about why they are bad and why they are good )

I think it has to be at least a little bit about the prison (the place in which we live), I like to think that there is some place in the world (or in your head) that you like, some place/people that you think are beautiful, some places that you would like to escape to, all sorts of little things."|0
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the ""Haaavaad baaa"" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. ""Do you like apples? ""the guy nods or something. ""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf."|1
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and it wasn't even funny, that is, hilarious, so it wasn't funny. It wasn't fun to sit through, either, so that's what I'm calling it. I'm calling it because I'm done being scared of this movie and I'm tired of being afraid of this movie and this movie. Because it's a movie I don't want to be afraid of no matter what, so that's what I'm calling it.|0
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles.|1
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people: his own mother and her mother, both widows living with their husbands in the East End; his grandmother, the only person in the house who knows him as “Uncle John”. He has never had a home of his own, but is taught by these people that he will someday be able to move into an actual home. But first he must find a place to hide out, in a house and neighborhood that he never knew he could exist in.|0
I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born.|1
"Yet another in the long line of ""Don't"" films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be."|1
I saw this film when it premiered in LA . I think I laughed 2 or three times . The premise of the film is amazing . However, the dialogue, the acting , the directing and the production were all not up to par. I am not complaining as it was a great film. I just think that all of the people who made this film have to learn some more acting / directing / writing skills. It would have made this film better. I am sorry if I am sounding negative . I am a critic . You can call me crazy .|0
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. As previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. I felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones.|1
"I 've never made one of these before , but this movie was literally so bad I had to say it had to be watched in order, and it wasn't half bad. At least I don't have to be the asshole who says, ""this is the most terrible movie ever""

Lol I'm the same way, I've only seen an episode of The Office, and I've probably only seen like, about 2 episodes in total, and I'm still like, that's not a movie, I need to have a better idea about what I'm looking at."|0
Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par.|1
This story starts at the end ! So the film 's opening credits advise us . Unfortunately that 's not exactly how it happened. Instead, the film opens with a quote from the film's narrator . He's the one who tells us what he thinks about the story as a whole. So when the opening credits appear at the very end of the film, there 's nothing wrong with that ! In the first place, the quote was in the title of the film , and that would have made no difference .|0
I did have a good time the first 45 min . or so , but then suddenly it was all downhill . and I couldn't find the right words to express what was going through my head . I felt like I was on the run , I was so excited , but I felt like a coward . It was like my heart wasn't in my head , it was in my throat . I just couldn't breathe. But I didn't want to give up , I didn't want to let the day get to me like I had before .|0
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his Japanese gangster films , and for the series of samurai films which have been the most consistent of the series ever since the 1960s and early 70s , and continue to the present day . The first film in this series, the 1965 film The Karate Kid , marked the first appearance of the Japanese actor Keiko Honda. It also introduced many of his many successors in the role of the Karate Kid . It also introduced a very famous karate karate movie which is often seen in American cinemas , the 1967 film Karate Kid.|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.|1
Back in August , '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies , big hits like `` Urban Cowboy '' and `` Midnight Run`` ( a.k.a. `` D-E-E-DROP`` ) were being produced . Then in March , '82 , the buzz started to slow . The big hit films that were expected to bring in $1 million, and were going to do so quickly, were just sitting in a pile and not being made . So what was wrong ? For the last decade, there has been a major problem with film production in the USA .|0
This film wasn't good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever.|1
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they 're life styles and pasts which support this.The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors' seamless acting teamed with Bechard's Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story.|1
This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England.|1
Yet again, director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a cosy life on a Caribbean island.|1
Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate.|1
Okay , it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke ( when the dead are rising from their tombs , the names of these people come to life on your computer ) . You'll find this one at the end of your video . Thanks for checking out this one , and sorry to have it end before you came to it . It's just something I had to do with the title . This is my little hobby . It can get me in trouble . But I am trying to take this thing seriously . . . . I hope you liked it . If you did enjoy it .|0
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I found myself very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all let me preface my review with the fact that I love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era.|1
This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy.|1
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.|1
The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this.|1
For a moment , let 's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie , even if it is a comedy , because I want to tell you what I think happened. I think I know why it didn't work. First , let me be perfectly clear, I was never asked to review this, this film was never even made , so I've got nothing to review. But let's take a second to discuss the movie itself, and then we can start discussing the issue. I don't know if it really did work or not.|0
This is a piece of cinematic beauty , and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other film I know. It is one of those movies where it is hard to separate the movie from the characters, but it’s still an entertaining story. I really enjoyed it. It is a movie that I would like to see all the way through with a friend, it’s got great action. If you want a movie like this in your collection, there is no better place to start! It is the story of a young man who is trying to get his life straightened out.|0
"In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of ""men off the street"" expounding on the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all."|1
MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc. ), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture.|1
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow.The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: So if Starbuck thinks she knows where Earth is why not send her out in a Raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust.|1
Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly.|1
"Do NOT avoid this movie . Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious . It possibly deserves a rating higher than ""D"" so that we know that it's not that bad . But if you want to laugh out loud while you watch this movie , then go ahead and download it . I have to admit that I laughed the most at the end of this movie, but it's because I don't understand why they do that. At first it's because the writer thinks that the character has no life, and they need to write that way to make it make sense ."|0
"(This has been edited for space)Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola's ""Thérèse Raquin""."|1
Until today , I thought there only three people , including me , who considered Heaven 's Gate ( 1980 ) to be a masterpiece. But after a while it seems like I have come to like the way it all fits together, the way it seems like it's not just a really great film, it's part of a whole larger narrative. It seemed like a shame not to include it in this review, but I didn't want to make a huge ode to it, I just thought it was a fascinating piece of work, and I thought it'd be great if you'd check it out!|0
"i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...""thing"" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get ""The Nun"".And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!"|1
Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. He, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., How sweet. Lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time, he is partnered with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty.|1
"Yesterday I watched this tv production, and I was very disappointed.I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the ""turn off""-switch.The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients, and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations."|1
'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but was unable to finish it. I'll review this film version solely on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.|1
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not too good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. If you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. It's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was titled HOSTAGE.|1
To paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard Moe and Larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant.|1
Although this movie (and I use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway, certain that if Jones was in the movie, it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses, I was additionally reassured by seeing another well-known face.|1
Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her.|1
Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of that.So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission.|1
We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set , under the title `` The Broken Skull . `` I don’t own it myself , although I think I got a good copy from somebody else . The artwork is excellent , the cover is excellent , but as you’ll find out on the next page , this is actually the first book I’ve owned that isn’t in trade . I’ve had the book since I was about 12 , and have had the original for over a year .|0
I remember when this show came out . It was originally advertised as a mini-series . At the end of the day it was more like an hour long tv movie . I was so happy that I ended up enjoying the movie . I have always loved this show and this is my favorite anime yet . This show is so amazing . You should go and watch this anime with your kids and their friends . I really think you will find it to be the greatest show ever . It has all the best bits and is so funny .|0
`` Problem Child '' was an okay movie , but did it really merit a sequel ? I do n't know if the original is much better than a sequel . It's not terrible , but there's a reason why it was only rated PG . I do n't think anyone would give the movie the A rating and not give it a sequel . They should try again , and see how many times it works . I don't have the time to look at it . The original was fun , but not great . It did have good acting and some very funny parts .|0
Piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. It starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest. For all I know it could be Florida. At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith, who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light.|1
"Unfortunately a boring flick , and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version. This has nothing to do with the movie and the film is very much in need of a DVD release. This is only available on the internet because of its obscurity. This is not to say the film does not have its merits, it's just very rare to find. The plot is not as convoluted as a typical ""Action"" movie, but rather just another mindless action flick about a woman and a group of thugs."|0
It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover.|1
I thought this was a great action flick. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. It got me thinking, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking butt. I just hope to see Geena in another film soon. Seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long.|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ? ).This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr K's era. It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors.This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war.|1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this one out. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.In this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system.|1
Assy McGee is an out-of-control , hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas . . . and a character so powerful and indestructible his name is used in film and TV shows , TV movies , and comics . . . as the name implies, McGee is an unstoppable, hard-nosed, smart-aleck, hard-living, and hot-headed cop who goes by the code name “Sarge”. But when he gets a new assignment, that code name is no more, and so McGee goes on a berserk quest to take back the badge and the woman who was once his soul mate .|0
You may not believe this , but when the credits to this movie rolled , I looked for the director. And I was not disappointed ! The story was told through the eyes of an old man that lived to see this day, and it had all the hallmarks of what I wanted from the movie. I love that movie ! Even though there are few scenes where the camera is moving around the entire set, the editing and sound effects were masterful. The story was interesting and the pace was very good. In conclusion , I think this movie is a wonderful watch.|0
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival , we have titles from all over the world . China is the first to be featured in the competition and we are thrilled to have had the opportunity to talk to a lot of the festival’s organizers and presenters in Shanghai. We spoke to the festival organizers at the festival as well as a number of China’s best directors, writers and producers about how they plan to introduce competition features to Chinese audiences. First we would like to say that we want to thank them for hosting such an amazing event with over 500 films in competition.|0
Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was soooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disapointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it did suck. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too dense or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't see it!|1
"When I saw the trailers for this movie , it looked like a good romantic comedy . I expected some funny lines and witty dialogue but I did not expect this to be a love triangle . The script is so well written that you can tell a lot of thought went into the movie. It is quite funny and entertaining which you can see for yourself by checking out the trailer below . The film is based on the famous Japanese manga ""Bakuman "", written by Yuriko Yoshitoyo and illustrated by Toshio Suzuki, which tells about the romance between the protagonist Kanna and her love interest Yukie ."|0
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who , as a child , specifically asked for something because it was just so special. As a person , I have not only been blessed with great teachers and other great teachers in our school but also, great mentors. One of the greatest of these mentors is a woman who has helped to shape my life to be the best that it is possible to be. She is the inspiration for this short story. A woman with a vision and an example for our children to follow.|0
You do n't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I do n't know a word to describe this film. I've seen many films, but this one has to be top notch. The film has an amazing cast, and all of them have a certain charisma and ability to carry the film to its end. One of the main highlights of the film is the end scene, which is probably the best of the whole film. I think there is a possibility that it could go in any movie, but this is definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.|0
"""No one really knows how the Power came to be. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted The families of Ipswich formed a Covenant of Silence bla bla bla"" After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't."|1
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasn't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest.|1
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer.|1
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that didn't really show. There wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive.|1
"* * * * * I reveal two 'twists ' at the end of the film . Do not read them as such. They are not a twist . . . a 'twist . . . at all . . .""' B.R. 's ""Twists""

In the middle of _A View from the Bridge,_ the credits roll. Suddenly, we are confronted with the following two titles:

Back in the 70 's , a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F . Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent comedies in the horror genre -- and they were all, at one time, considered the best of his generation. For a while, Brownrigg was a star. From his first film, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, through the first and second installments of The Ring, Brownrigg was able to sell a small-screen movie that audiences would soon come to know better as Freddy Vs. Jason, but those comedies never took off the way other horror comedies did, and many of his comedies failed to make back a decade later.|0
"I don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe I will in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the ""chemistry"" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie....and have the DVD on order!"|1
Though it 's a Christmas movie , `` Christmas in Connecticut '' could have been done any time of year. But it was not a Christmas movie that made the film so special, but a different Christmas that made it that special. This was the same year when the film ``It'' won the Academy Award for Best Picture , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score. The same year, John Wayne was nominated as the best-dressed movie star and the same year , a girl named Marilyn Monroe won the Oscar for Best Actress .|0
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me . The cast was beautiful , lovely to watch in all of their different colors. I didn’t get to see a lot of the scenery in the area either , but i’ll be taking some time to do it some day before i go back. A few people said they’re staying longer, so it would be good if they do. It’s a gorgeous trip to be on , and i really look forward to next year. I only wish it would be shorter than it has been.|0
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever living shit out of me. There was just so much blood and gore and terror that it was beyond belief. My parents didn’t have cable so we watched the film on VHS tapes. I think it was an early 70’s TV show that aired in Canada and I have a vague memory it was on Channel 9 or something like that. It must have been in the early 90’s though.|0
The producers of this picture are Hungarians . It 's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are dancing in a circle . I have never seen them dance like that before . But they are not dancing to a song , rather it's the dancing of the moment . I can not describe how much I love these two in this film . There are so many great songs in this video that it is impossible to pick out a favourite . Let me talk about some of these . X and Z just dance . But there is a dance between Z and Z and X and X .|0
"My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. After starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. Now, he stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies."|1
Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. At the final scene, I was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.Only one name in it I ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must've been very hungry to take this part.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! !|1
The first time I saw this was when I was with a date , and she thought it was an interesting thing on its own. She had just finished reading about it and said she really wanted to learn about it. I knew right away I would love to learn more about this, so we decided to get together and teach it to her and then take a tour of her city. I had never done a tour before. I was very excited to do something like that. But it turned out she really didn't need a tour.|0
I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years . I had never seen this adaptation , so after watching part one of the series , I was extremely excited. I was told that I would like this adaptation and I had no reason to doubt it. This adaptation is very well thought out. The storyline is intriguing and there are a couple of surprises that I was anticipating . This is the first series I have seen and I enjoyed it. It is well produced and is well put together. I was a little unsure of the direction and I thought that the book was slightly better than the movie.|0
For several reasons, this movie is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant. I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. And shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. But this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.There's worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing.|1
Ok, when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, maybe one of the greatest B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story isn't bad either. Now I wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.|1
"And so it started with ""Shreik"" a send up of horror films, then we had Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: Scary Movie* Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4* Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....Super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny."|1
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing.|1
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's about time Hollywood got their act together. The big Studios always frown at edgy material, with Oscar written all over it. Go figure! !JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. It's a masterpiece.Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my film-viewing lifetime.|1
"I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as ""The Sound of Music,"" none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially amazing songs are ""Easy To Be Hard,"" ""Age of Aquarius,"" ""Hair,"" ""Flesh Failures/3-5-0-0,"" ""Walking In Space,"" and ""Hare Krishna."" Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to someday see it live!"|1
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show.I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she once again kicked butt. It was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys.|1
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others.|1
The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman 's `` Autumn Sonata '' ( 1978 ) starring Ingrid Bergman as the young Bergman in the role of a woman who had an affair with a man. However, with this remake, Bergman appears as he was when he filmed the film. Borgman is in his mid-fifties at the time, with gray hair, bushy mustache and beard. He had the most beautiful eyes and the most intelligent face. But, after the film, he seems to be in his seventies, with the same eyes and beard.|0
"One of the commenter's is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the ""Electric Chair"" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn't help matters."|1
Although I saw this movie in Korea , in Korean , and therefore did not understand the language , images , and all that, but if I may say , it is a very beautiful story and I do agree with you that it is one of the best Korean movies on the list of the best Korean movies . I would have to agree as well . This review contains explicit images of violence, which are not my choice. If you have seen the film and find this review unacceptable, please write in your own review, so it can be posted on the main site and get more visitors.|0
"When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through ""the motions."" i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it."|1
"We are in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called ""The Man"". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness."|1
"This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad saving his kid from burning house. I really didn’t like the story and it was quite predictable for me, but I was glad that I saw the movie so I can relate to their struggle to save their daughter’s life. This film has some great scenes but the whole movie was too much to watch for me. This is a classic film and you should watch this one. What to Watch For

I would recommend this movie for anyone who love watching the American Dad movie with his daughter."|0
You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot.|1
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 yrs at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store the old lady was at. However, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it hasn't been already. A bit of trivia, Illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals.|1
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's performance of their careers. The film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on DVD.|1
I did n't understand the people who rated it over 5 . I think it 's a horrible film from start to finish , and i had a difficult time figuring out who the villains are . The only character that i could relate to was the little boy in a wheelchair who is the only person on the ship that doesn't scream . The rest of the crew are all like this . What made this film so terrible was that most of the people on the ship were like this . The ship is destroyed after the end and everyone is trapped on it .|0
Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood, and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 R D Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyricsEven if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.)|1
I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort I managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on like this but I think you're getting the point......nothing happens ever in this movie.|1
For reasons I can not begin to fathom , Dr. Lorenzo Cameron ( George Zucco ) begins injecting wolf 's blood in humans. These people go mad , turning into werewolves and are eventually hunted down. The only two people who survive are Dr. Cameron, and the two wolves who turned on him. The story is told through both the point-of-view of Dr Cameron as he watches the story unfold, but also through that of the wolves who survived his blood. It is a slow, suspenseful story of suspense, but one that is also beautiful and powerful at the same time.|0
There wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie but that's about it.- The movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.- My understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age.|1
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it . It was one of those movies where it really hit the spot and there were a ton of great parts to it . the script is fantastic and the actors are great . there's really nothing that I can think of that is not really in the movie . There's some really good comedy in here , a ton of emotion and drama and even some sex . I think that there is something about this movie that I just haven't seen before or seen in the past two weeks .|0
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots.|1
`` Ahh ... I did n't order no amazing hit show '' ..... '' We 'll you got one '' I'm so excited '' I got it '' it's on now. I'm like '' I don't care '' I feel like I should be there ... I am I'm not that way when I was younger, I'm like '' I 'll see you around''. I'm here, I 'm ready, you 're welcome, and that's the best I can say. I 'm still the same kind of guy who was the first person in my family when I got my license ...|0
Saw this at the video store and thought I 'd give it a try . Sounded like a good story . There is so much misinformation in the community about the dangers of drinking coffee, that I thought this might be a good place to clarify things . Coffee drinking is an easy, natural way to cut back on the caffeine you are consuming each day. The caffeine in coffee is the same caffeine that the body has to make every day so the only difference between a coffee drinker and their coffee drinker is in the amount of the caffeine .|0
The Priest , into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love , but the process of love. The Priest is not the object, but the subject, and what he does and how he does it and what his suffering is. So the Priest is both the object and the subject. His suffering is the object but his love is also the subject. His sufferings are the object. His sufferings is the object of love. The object is the Priest. He is not the subject and subject is not the object.|0
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, it was a long time ago. That said, it’s still amazing, and very much worth seeing, especially if you haven’t seen it, but you should make it a priority to see it. A lot of stuff in the film was very clever, but some scenes in particular just don’t hold up very well:

Robert Taylor is very good as Mr. Hyde. And the scene where Taylor sings “When you’re ready to run”?"|0
Wow , Kiss the Bride was n't that bad , but it was n't that good either . It sure was not as good as I had thought it to be . i think there is a bit to much going on , but i still liked it . . . though i liked it , not as much as i would like it to be . there is also , i would say a little bit too much going on . i liked the first three episodes , but didn't really find anything good about them . and the way in which they presented the idea of the bridal shop .|0
"A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple.Then there's Linda Blair. ""The Exorcist"". That's it.When you see ""Chained Heat"" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.Certainly not, ""Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come! ""Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize."|1
"This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder, ""Where is Ralph Macchio?"" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, then Myiagi can come along and add some more! Macchio could've been the love interest for Julie in this film! Never mind!On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what Daniel's were."|1
This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame , fake-looking bird puppet which is just a bit too silly to make it to the final film - but also that it doesn't need to do any of this. It could just be that we all have some things we love and some things which make us scratch our heads wondering what the f**k they are. I will never understand why anyone would love this movie, and I have to admit that while watching the trailers, I almost fell asleep at the very end.|0
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful! !, as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, not a damn thing happens!. All the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!,plus The ending is especially lame!. The only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however he is wasted here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever!, plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over!.|1
Apparently this movie was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminded me of how when I see that someone has been murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I move on. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point?|1
Let 's face it , a truly awful movie , no ... I mean a `` truly '' awful movie , really. I don 't say that just to put out fires, but because the film is so poorly done. I will not even go further into detail here because it's a spoiler. It 's just something I have to watch. Now that I have got to see it , I don 't know whether I am going to love it or leave it. There are a couple of things in it that I didn't really like and there are some really bad acting.|0
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival . It was great . Stormy is the name of the film. You can see the film on youtube . The film is available for free on iTunes and Amazon . I’m not sure if I will ever finish it or not, it’s too much for me. If you are interested , here is my review of the film . You can buy the film for a couple bucks. It is one of the first films I have ever watched as a kid.|0
"Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely under-used and has SO much more to offer besides ""Agent Mulder"" (although I'm a huge fan of that series too), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows love never dies... it's with you forever."|1
While out divining for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm.|1
At first sight, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.Really, what you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him, he needs the money.This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago.|1
... and in this series , I 've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle . Remember that time I got so excited when a girl walked by my house in my pajamas ? Yeah . It was so awesome , but a few hours later I realized the girl was a boy . . . . . . and I thought it was all the funniest joke ever , so I 've forgotten it. Anyway , I 'd really appreciate it if we could all stick around for a bit longer. I 'm not in any pain , but I 'd sure like to get a good night\'s sleep.|0
Well ... it 's about time ! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that 's his big return since the first one ... with a new star on the box ! We 've seen the movie before ... so it'll be interesting to see what 's going to go on in this sequel ... as it's not like the original one where the whole movie was about one guy ... and this 's a bigger action movie ! This is the second movie Van Damme has worked on since he returned from the army ... the first one came out in 1999 ... his next one ...|0
I can only think of one reason this movie was released . To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Ritchie. This movie is the only film I have ever seen where he is not the lead star and the only movie that I know about where he wasn't the main star. I'm not sure how Ritchie is able to get away with this movie. He is a director with little or no actual directing ability. The only thing that makes this a great film is the acting. Not that I'm a big Guy Ritchie fan but I like all his films.|0
"Throughout watching ""End of Days"", I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see ""Se7en"") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us."|1
Computer savvy John Light ( as John Elias ) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon . But he doesn't know the first thing about the Internet . So when the dotcom bubble blows and he's left with a bank balance as a result, he struggles to keep a lid on his greed , paranoia and power hungry paranoia . . . and it all gets worse when his teenage love turns into a teen-age dotcom millionaire and his dot.com empire crashes . . . , right when the Internet is supposed to be going global .|0
This movie reeks . No money , no acting , no nothing . I caught this on on the 3am and i dont know what the story line is all about but i have no idea. The only thing that i think about is the character of the guy in front of the bar and what his face shows. I dont want to see anything bad happen but it just reeks of something bad. I wish there was more than one. The only thing that I’m not really sure of is why this movie isn’t on Disney Channel.|0
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat , this is the type of art that gets seen on the street. And yet, we don’t talk about Warhol like this. And yet that’s all he is, an icon. Warhol’s art is so much bigger than Andy Warhol. Because of the popularity of the Andy Warhol phenomenon, some people think we shouldn’t be talking about Andy Warhol, and that we should talk about something else entirely. What is this art we talk about when we discuss the Warhol phenomenon?|0
After reading some of these reviews , it is apparent that some have missed the point . What is great is that when you see how great the product actually is , you don't even notice that you have the chance to save a buck or two. I agree with the above review. I have been using this item for nearly 2 years and would still recommend it to anyone. The reason I purchased it over the competition is that this product has never broke, it is in perfect working order and I have never had a problem with it.|0
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote.|1
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott(Marshall Thompson)has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott(Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil. On Dan's second flight, he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm.|1
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they only been allowed to make it to the ’80s in America. It is, without question, the worst movie I have ever seen, but there are a few things that the movie tries to explain and it fails miserably at doing so. If there ever were an opportunity to show how the world has become more and more violent and stupid by the time you are 13, this is the movie to do that.|0
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing . Guy Rolfe , so fantastic that I will be watching more of him. However there is something about the movie that sets it apart. This is an odd mixture of comedy, drama, sci-fi/fantasy and horror. We start off with one of the best bits of the movie, but we get so many little moments that you can’t tell where it’s coming from and the direction it is heading in, or if it will go in any direction.|0
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. Even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.Unlike most HK actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and a roll-call of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery.|1
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a turkey and the some. What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive I think so).|1
"`` I remember waiting to be born ... '' `` Vision quest that was the American West . '' `` There was a place you went to when you weren't allowed to be an adult . '' `` He didn't see you. He doesn't have a vision of what it means to be a man. He doesn't see how it makes him a man .

'' `` There was a time you weren't allowed to be an adult . Now you are,   
And maybe that's just as bad . '' `` You know you're part of a community where you never had to be a kid before . ''"|0
I completely understand WHY this movie was made . Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome masterpiece in the tradition of the great French films of the late 60's, early 70's - but one of the greatest films I've ever been involved in. In fact, I went to see it in the theater with my wife when it came out. I was in shock the entire time and it left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing it. My favorite scene: the rape and murder of Sarah Polley. That scene was absolutely haunting.|0
"I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night . Frankly , I have never heard about this movie so I am surprised. Well it was at a drive-in movie theater in the 70's and I remember the movie . Well , it was not very well seen so I have not seen it on TV since then

So anyway I am going to tell you about it and then we will see if it still holds up . Now for those who don't know about it . What you will see is that a boy falls into a hole which leads him down into a black void ."|0
One of the most successful shows in television history is back . Now I admit I never got into the Star Trek series very early. I watched the first season of The Next Generation, that's all I watched in my entire childhood. But I loved every single episode of the first series. Every single episode. I grew up with Spock, William Riker, Uhura, and the Enterprise crew. This was the first series I watched in my whole life, and as I said, I grew up watching the show. I didn't know there was a second series though.|0
"I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.Ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call ""assistant"" to Evie, a retired actress."|1
This movie is something horrible . I was laughing all the time . I was forced to stop in some moments . This is one of the most horrible movie i have ever see and i have been watching it since a long long time ago. This is the only reason why i will watch this movie ever and it will be my last ever. This is an abomination. I really do not understand why people do not realize that this movie is an abomination. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but it ends up turning into an awful, terrible movie.|0
"What to say about `` Dead End Road '' ... Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been very happy to have been wrong. Thursday, July 11, 2009

I had the privilege of writing an introduction to this site some three years ago, and this is one of the reasons I consider this to be the finest of all my blog sites, in my humble opinion. A lot has changed over the years, but one thing that has not -- at least in my humble opinion -- has changed, however, is the quality of the writing."|0
"Walt was particularly fond of quality . So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited version of _The Jungle Book_ , but no one was allowed to watch it? As Walt himself said, it was originally intended for an audience ""that could not watch the film itself""—but the censors wouldn't permit the film to be shown. And that's just what they did, so Walt could finally see _The Jungle Book_ in its entirety, and it was as if the whole of the film was taken off the air."|0
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits.|1
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art.|1
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful . There are very few laughs in the entire film and the film’s overall quality leaves a lot to be desired , especially with how awful it is to begin with. The story follows two women that are struggling to make ends meet and the way they deal with the problems they face is ridiculous. I’m not gonna get into the plot because I don’t even care for it , I’m just getting too excited to see the movie so this review is just for enjoyment.|0
"This is absolute drivel , designed to shock and titillate the 60 's mindset . The acting is completely wooden . The plot is as bland as it is predictable . The dialogue consists of little more than the same stock lines of "" we need to change the world"" , "" we need to change the world, "" "" we don't need to do nothing , "" "" we don't need to change nothing , "" and the ever so popular "" you're just like everyone else "" . What's wrong with you , people ? I've never been so disgusted with a movie."|0
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that did n't really show, this was very well made and acted, there were some interesting moments but I think I would rather have seen it again with a better budget, this is a great film and worth a look. I really liked all the actors in it, the best were the ones who weren't the stars so far as acting is concerned. I like this film, but I am afraid it will get a bad review in a few weeks.|0
Although it was dark, depressing, and at times hard to watch, You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. Her compelling and believable performance made the movie. It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute. Who knows.|1
"I realize most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience. But then why bother to call it ""Solomon Kane"" in the first place when the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. That's where the resemblance ends.It's always a bad sign when any superhero/fantasy/sci-fi movie lingers over an origin story, but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all, you've already missed the point completely."|1
All I can do is laugh . Wow . I like Jim Wynorski 's movies , I really do . However , his acting is so bad , and the character he plays in these films is so boring . He's the first person I have ever complained to about a bad actor . If you have read my blog you'll know I love his movies . If you've not then I suggest you go and have a look ! The only thing he can do is laugh . Wow . This is the first time in my whole life I've ever been this upset .|0
"As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.It's on par with Sam Raimi's ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. You'll see the similarities at several points. Most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best."|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made . The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand it. It is like watching one of those science fiction films, but not the same. I could care less if it was good or not, it is what it is. In fact, I have not watched any of the films on this list. They are there so I can say that I have seen them all and I have a good opinion on them. In the end all I can say is that the films on this list are horrible .|0
This movie was definitely on the boring side . The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice , but it was a bit weak in its storyline and it had some weak dialogues . I did find this film very enjoyable , but not as amazing as its predecessor. I think the sequel would have been better . I found it very enjoyable but it would be nice if the sequel is a little bit stronger too . Overall i think it is a decent horror movie . 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.|0
"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski's ""Curse of the Komodo"", this still sucks...BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in ""Curse of the Komodo"", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........I don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! As in ""Curse of the Komodo"", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island!"|1
"I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. I think it's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movie ""City of God"", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. I enjoyed very much the soundtrack."|1
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? Only hope this is first and the last as well, for God's sake ! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. Why does Himesh not smile ?|1
Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!|1
"Philistines beware , especially American ones ! This has all the elements you 'll hate - a langorous approach to language, a desire to make others do something they 're not willing to do themselves and it all starts to get rather muddled , messy , confusing at times . It all has to start somewhere so here are the basics:

The language is used in various ways throughout the game, which will be explained later in this article . However , as the langauge is the basis of gameplay , it is used here to explain the mechanics of the language and the general use of the language by players."|0
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde ' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it 's intended to be, is doing it in good faith, because she's a woman and a writer, but it doesn't take much effort to look at her in this way. There's a lot of that in the piece, and the tone she employs is not always the most gentle. But she is, to me, one of the very best things you could do with a person, a person you love, if that's the right way to look at her.|0
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame. George was great in that character - very expressive.Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part. She gave a great performance. She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS.|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. It´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.|1
"With the war not going well for the Soviet Union , Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the Gulag to train them. By Joseph H. Whaley

On a warm September day in 1952, a few weeks before his 70th birthday, I was sitting with two other journalists in the offices of the British-based Soviet newspaper, the New Statesman. It was early in the afternoon, and the mood was cheerful. We all had our notebooks in front of us, and our conversation had been edited so as to omit any references to any unpleasant incidents that had occurred during the past two weeks."|0
"THE worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen allot. Acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! Ok, I admit, `Air Bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `Soccer Dog'. This ""dog"" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, don't watch this movie."|1
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen . When I watched the manga review in english it said that this anime is terrible and had no plot whatsoever. And now that I have read the manga I feel that it is a much better anime . The plot has some good elements such as good fight scenes , good animation , and interesting characters . But the plot is boring , the characters are boring and there are only five episodes to an anime . And the worst thing about this anime is that they can't decide which of the five episodes are the bad episodes .|0
In the mid 1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities.|1

It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa!Wow. What a skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.... Just some things to point out...1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I do need counseling now.2) There is no God, there is just Dude.. I love that quote from Crow.3) Whatever did happen to the Nuns that took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach.4) Lastly, don't watch this movie un-MSTied... It has Joe Estevez as the main star.. Yikes..1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.|1
"I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot, but it seems like most of you think that's not a good idea. What is so bad about it, other than it's a generic ""movie"". I'm sure you could have a great story and a plot with this movie, but what's wrong with making it a ""movie""? I wouldn't be surprised to find you were wrong about that. The film is original and it's the best of what we've seen."|0
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well . Compared to those of today, I’d say most of his works are good, and his films are usually very good. The problem is that we have so many films from different time periods made in the past, and we often get lost in our own world. And it’s not just that we don’t understand the language, we also don’t get a very good grasp of the culture in which the films were made.|0
The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch.|1
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . Drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . Hey I think I`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE EVER SEEN or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX EVER SEEN . Oh hold on I`m not married and I`ve never been on honeymoon !|1
Yes sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, I really enjoyed it.|1
"This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being ""weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students"". Sorry TV writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality."|1
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. This film goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society.|1
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the Caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . Also, it would have been very simple to make. All the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel.|1
"""Graduation Day"" is a result of the success of ""Friday the 13th."" Both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film, I'd recommend ""Graduation Day."" If not, I wouldn't. There's nothing new here, just the same old killings.Even though I've given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say that it's not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative."|1
Okay , so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again ! ' Week in , week out its always going to end with some of the same old boring posts, so this series is gonna be different each and every week, I will try my best to cover a wide variety of subjects, so check it out and see what I got up for you ! I will try to do it in such a way as that there will be some of the same posts, but at least they will be interesting ones !|0
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life . it's not that the plot is bad, or that it is hard to tell the story , it is just that it is just so damn boring . i just don't understand what the problem is , it seems to be just the fact that i can't get my head around this film . i did like the first one , but this one makes me want to walk out of the movie . there is no point in doing this , there is nothing to get accomplished here .|0
Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl!|1
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I 've yet run across, if not one of the most ridiculous. The plot involves Hercules trying to rescue a kidnapped Princess of Thrace, but after he rescues her and then discovers she is the daughter of Zeus, they go out of the city, where the people start to fight. That is where the film's problem begins. The first part of the movie consists of the people fighting and Hercules fighting a dragon, so we know that the script is at least semi-written.|0
This great film never showed up in my town, so actually I didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. The tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so I hope to see it once again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it, if you ever have the chance.|1
"So bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers ""horror"" flicks? The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called ""uniforms"" the ""military"" jokers wear. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in ""Jurassic Park,"" but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here."|1
the movie is complete disaster . i do n't know who write scripts for movies like this one , but this is a movie about a man who has to take care of his 3 year old son , who is dying and has no money . it would be a great idea if someone could make a film like this for real , because as far as movies go , it's an abomination . I loved it. The story and characters of the movie were great. I can see how some would be angry about it and think it was poorly written and the director didn't know what they were talking about.|0
Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. Plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed.|1
This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced USA drama. The characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.Just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. I guess it was no a low budget film. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. Maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.No more hope in cinema...|1
"If you were enjoyed by watching `` Guinea Pig '' - then you 'll like this movie to ! `` `` ''

I really liked the characters that were playing, but I wasn't satisfied with the story because it was a bit confusing at times. But overall it was a good movie, the story and the acting were good. It's a little bit different from most horror flicks as there are more than one character that is being killed off, but it was still okay to watch. It's rated PG-13 for some reason."|0
"This is an odd movie . On the surface it 's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but there are enough elements to set it apart and the performances are outstanding. There is a strong story, well thought out, well acted and acted as well as the acting. It has it all with a great soundtrack. A great movie that you don't have to rent to watch for free. Check this movie out for a fun time. Rating: 4.5 out of 5

Genre: Horror, Blood, Gore, Slasher

Runtime: 113 mins."|0
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school and not having the courage to go in and apply for that dream job that you're going to get at a certain point in time. I feel like you just have to be strong and just go with your gut. I've been in the same position as you. I was told by someone who I respected that they didn't want to tell me what they wanted, that I was the one who would have to convince them.|0
"8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had basically ""phoned-in"" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.But upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.With the exception of Spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot ""longer in tooth"" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v."|1
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.There's two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy.|1
"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the ""earlies"" (often black and white and inventive), the ""naughties"" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the ""nudies"" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and ""the rest"".This is part of the ""rest"". It is not really a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly no gorefest. The few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all."|1
"I don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but I'm glad I'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the ""Die Hard"" series, but seeing little Jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a Glock, as a NOVICE yet...c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a ripped T-shirt and she would BE Bruce Willis. Apparently, Jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be."|1
"If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli ""Okkadu"" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of ""Okkadu"" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end."|1
This film is so 1980's and that is what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. Reagan in the White House telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. Young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead.|1
"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. ""Constantine""), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la ""Manos The Hands of Fate""). Now that I've seen ""Dr. Gore"" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly execrable."|1
Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.But this movie?|1
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you , if you like your films with a message , if you like your films you can’t sit there and accept it as the best film of the year, the best film of the decade, it’s got to be so much better. I know I can’t sit there and accept it but I love the fact that we now have the chance to tell stories in a way that is true to life, so that it’s very real for the audience and very powerful.|0
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombard. And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American didn't bring war here. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused.The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people.|1
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was I wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive other than they both take place on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.This movie will not hold most people's attention. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud.|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations.|1
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get mixed reviews. It made it into the finals and got some attention for the first half of the year. After that it fell off my radar for a few months. When it came back, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it had potential. It was an interesting look at a character in the film and showed a lot of potential for a film that I really liked. That being said I was very disappointed in the ending. There was not enough development for the character.|0
"The inspiration for the ""Naked Gun"" movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like ""Airplane!"" and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving.It's too bad that the show only had six episodes."|1
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
"Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking -- and is thought by the local folk of East Africa to be one of the founding figures of the new religion. The story is told in ""The Heart of the Matter,"" a recent documentary film about one of the founding figures of the new religion of the mountain people, a group that is still called by the local people ""the Christians"" despite the fact that they are Muslims. ""This is not something that was created by humans,"" explains Hepburn, who co-directs the documentary with her husband, director William G. Dietz."|0
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations , Blade is by far one of the best realised , most stylish and entertaining of them . I have seen a great number of great film adaptations of novels , television series and comics since I first became interested in the genre, and Blade stands out as my favorite , in a great variety of ways . I’m not usually one for “ what’s good for the film ” reviews , as this is not a film that “ should be made ” at all .|0
It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial `` wake-up call '' . And , as with many people who are confronted with these kinds of situations, he or she might just as easily turn the tables and say that it is time for them to `` get a life '' or `` get off the soapbox '' . This may be because, as is the case with many celebrities , they are famous because they are in a certain type of situation. Or it may just be that these situations are what they really enjoy doing.|0
"... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging."|1
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual `` horror '' movie again . I had been disappointed with her last movie, but I don't mind that this one has a different focus. I don't know what makes me think it's a bad movie - I'm only watching it to make sure. I'm still a little bummed about the ending. What I am looking forward to is getting to see Jodie Foster once again. But that is not what makes me love this movie. It's not just the acting. You see that in the trailer.|0
The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker ( played by Drake Bell of Marvel fame). The man has become a superhero due to the success of his superhero comic books and then his career is destroyed when he was found to have a connection to a crime that occurred on his turf. He ends up getting killed by an unknown assailant but the police refuse to investigate. He then reappears in this movie to lead a group of superheroes and villains in an effort to take down the crime lord that is trying to take over New York City.|0
It 's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but `` Caligula '' surely must hold this distinction. Here are some thoughts that I had after seeing this movie. It's a good one. It had me laughing out loud the entire way. This movie is one that you don't expect to laugh at, but do it nonetheless. One of the best films I've seen for awhile. If you haven't seen it you're missing out a lot. It's funny and a bit scary at the same time.|0
SPOILER ALERT ! Do n't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot of great potential. It started with interesting characters and some interesting action. Then, the film took an interesting direction and the characters changed drastically, and now the film is stuck in a middle ground where the audience can only guess at what is going to happen next.The director had a great script and cast. There were some great scenes in the first act, but now the action becomes a chore. The characters are so boring.|0
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time . Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by claiming he’s not a movie director , he’s merely a stage actor . He’s actually in the same boat with his next movie , The Descent . He’s an actor who is not able to direct , but at least he can do one of the things he excels at, which is being an actor . Unfortunately , this is not an issue that Anthony Hopkins can deal with , which makes it an excellent opportunity for him to do a character-study about himself.|0
Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love-fest for the murderer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The Execution of Wanda Jean, with it's completely one sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. It tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. She seemed uneducated, but so did her entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded.|1
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that's not saying too much.|1
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya . I do not like his singing too . But his songs are a part of Pakistani culture and we love him for his songs . I am proud that he has been selected as the new chief minister of the Punjab . I am happy and proud of my people too . I know my people are not like that . That does not mean that they do not like me either . I am very happy that they like me . I respect and support the Punjab Government and the Prime Minister and all other people in and outside Pakistan .|0
Historically awful . Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity . One can not keep track of the various examples . But I have the best of intentions for the video . But in the end it turned out worse then expected . This should be a warning . So please do not make the video to much worse then it is meant to be . There is a warning here . I hope you enjoyed it . Well that was not what was expected . I had no intentions of making it as bad as it was . I just wanted to try my best to make an entertaining video .|0
"This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, ""Don't bother with us, we're all losers,"" you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. All the usual suspects are here."|1
"I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick . The shonky production values are way to overplayed for what it is but it was funny enough to keep you chuckling till the end . As I said above I have to admit it was funny in that way it is meant to be but it was still disturbing enough to get my stomach churning as well as my heart racing

It's a horror film, that is what I am saying. I am not a horror person. I think a lot of horror films can be funny."|0
Just in case the title did n't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review ? Yeah.I decided to watch this movie the day before I came home from New York. It came to the conclusion that I should just skip it, since it doesn't have a plot. So I did. And I was very disappointed. There's no plot at all. It just seems to be a lot of random actions and explosions that happen, and I've had enough. It's a bunch of random movies, most of which are very boring.|0

This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality , a movie in which a man goes back into time to rescue his mother from the Nazi’s who took her from him on the eve of the liberation of the concentration camps. It is a very compelling movie, and I do not have anything else to say on it, except to say that there is so much more that can be said about what happened in Europe on the night of June 8/9 1945.|0
First the premise stinks ... little boy likes to dress in girls clothes . It reminded me of Norman Bates in Psycho. Then the second premise ... well, he is a nice guy ..... and so is his grandmother. But she was not so nice to the little boy, she was mean to him and his family ... she told them they would be the first to go hungry. He didn't say that to her ! She was mean to her grandson and his family and that made him mad ... he was mean to little boy ! He was mean to his grandmother.|0
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical.|1
Produced by Nott Entertainment , this movie is `` nott '' very good at all . I sat through the whole movie and i could only watch part of the movie , because it was so long and it has soooo much story , but there are no characters or any real story in it . And i could only imagine this movie , because i am watching a movie , and i want to watch something that has characters and stories in it , and the only stories in it are about these characters , and the main character in this movie is sooo boring .|0
I 'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do . I 'm pretty sure you could do that as well . And I 'd be willing to bet that there is a lot you could do as well. What I can say is that it is a pretty funny, funny movie. It has some really funny moments. What I have to say about that movie and the movie that I have in the works is that I find it very difficult to write a positive review of this movie. It is a very funny movie.|0
Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good.|1
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities . It 's an enjoyable 90 minutes , demands little of the viewer . The film follows the lives of three rabbits which have become infected with a virus that can cause them to lose their hair, lose consciousness and die. The rabbits are treated by a small team of vets who have no idea of what they are dealing with, as the animals can not speak, but the team work with them from within. There is a great deal of humour , good acting , some good acting , good special effects .|0
"No blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.The acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of ""Nanny"", to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own ""Halfway"" house."|1
Help ! Once again , Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull , pedantic storytelling . I rearranged the chapters for this review , to help avoid spoilers. For those unfamiliar with Paul’s story, I’ve outlined the background of the plot here . If that’s any help, I would suggest that you read it . I’ve also read the book, and it has been a bit of a slog . I’m not going to spoil any of that, but I would like to point out that the book starts off fairly well, but quickly descends into a very bad plot .|0
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's and it got me hooked. So I decided to see this one in a theatre. It was a long day for me to go see it. I watched it during the day and at night on TV. I didn't have a projector and I couldn't get up in time to do the film. So I left it in the DVD player and the next morning when I opened the box it looked like a movie poster. That's how it looked to me.|0
Although this has to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode is n't badly written or acted. For starters, I love the way the episode begins and ends, it's got a great story and it doesn't feel quite as forced or forced as seasons one or three. It also has a really great beginning, which we can't say the same of season three. For me the beginning of the episode was really good, I just wish that the whole thing didn't end there. It's a little too long and it has too much buildup and not enough payoff.|0
Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale . £2.99 seems like a good value for the effort. It's got plenty of film in it , and some nice extras. The DVD is not in the best quality for the money. I am going to go ahead and buy a Blu Ray copy and see what I can do with it .I'm a fan of the movie.I'm not sure about this movie though . It's a bit weird , and the ending seemed a bit forced. It's not the worst film I've seen but I don't remember it being that good.|0
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks ? I know , become a porno artist. What else should you do ? Well , here is the answer. First, you must find something that you would like to be in the nude , something that will give you an opportunity to express yourself and make your own style. It is always advisable to be in front of a camera, even when you are working from the side. There are many porno scenes where you can show off a lot of skin.|0
"Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent ""civilised warfare"" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme."|1
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent ' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana , a beautiful princess kidnapped by a ruthless wizard and sold as a slave by him to an evil wizard in exchange for the life of his own son. In the middle of a dangerous, ancient battle, Diana narrowly avoids being taken by her captors. But she soon finds herself on the road to ruin. Is she the victim of evil, or evil is winning? This is the story of a young woman who finds herself being taken away by the Dark One.|0
This movie makes `` Glitter '' look like `` Schindler 's List . '' Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to spend some extra money to make this one look more attractive to a wide audience, but it does have its moments. As with most movies of this nature, it's best to watch it first to get the key plot points and not the movie. So here are my thoughts on what you need to know before this movie. * The title is very clever. I don't know why we've been waiting so long to hear this and now it's finally here.|0
I just finished watching this ( last weekend ) and found it absolutely hillarious , some of the scenes I had in my head were not in this show , but I am glad I picked up the first episode , I enjoyed the story that much more. There is so much history in this series, I can hardly wait until Season 2 , I can't wait to meet these characters and really get to see what they do on a day to day basis. I saw this episode before I saw episode 12, and I agree, it's one of my favs.|0
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'White Aborigine' music).|1
The Quick and the Undead is , finally , the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void of any meaning other than being a fun bit of horror that's not going to make you want to run to the nearest store to buy a copy of the DVD. This movie has been one of the best horror movies on my radar for the last year, and I have been waiting for it for so long, I had to finally make it my first priority this weekend. I was not disappointed. It's a well constructed story full of scares and the kind of scares I like.|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius . It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance . Some have said it was the best performance of the whole cast . It's not a film for the whole family . Some may find it very hard to watch at the beginning . For those who want to try watching it you can download the dvd and watch it in 720p . The movie is a great film to take your kids to see . The music is excellent . And the special effects and editing are absolutely amazing .|0
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon.|1

'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and per agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low renting rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in, and weird stuff starts happening, and because this is a B-grade horror flick, there's a dumb, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why.|1
"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke? ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters."|1
First of all , i have nothing against Christianity . i believe , every person has the right to believe in what he/she wants to believe in . but i think you are trying to compare Christianity to Islam when the only difference , is in the name of that religion , not the person . i have no problems with people , regardless of their religious beliefs , being able to live in peace with anyone , regardless of their religion . and if you want to talk about Jesus , i will also believe that he has the right to say that there is no deity or god .|0
"When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. And I was really impressed by it. I got goose pimples and I said to myself that I HAD to watch this film.And I did, and I've to say: This film is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... The message of this film is one of the most important ones: ""Make love, no war"". This film is a real masterpiece."|1
"Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident ""The Wind and the Lion"" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa.El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman(Candice Bergen) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of American president Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre.The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photography, very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness."|1
I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor , but this `` movie '' left me stunned in its lack of wit , or at least that is what I feel it should have. For the record I enjoyed the first movie, but the second movie I found rather tedious. I have been told that a sequel may be in the works, but I am skeptical. I understand that there is a script, but I think there is no reason that the film should have so many plot twists that make it impossible to watch.|0
I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. However, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet *real* for me. Before I saw this version, Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English. Having seen Jacobi's Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording.|1
"The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more ""user friendly"" for the big screen."|1
The MTV sci-fi animated series `` Æon Flux '' is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character as she takes on a new challenge of fighting a deadly virus that will take her to the outer reaches of space. The show is directed by David Slade, whose credits include the award-winning film ``The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury.'' Slade said: ``I feel like there's a certain level of freedom for Charlize to play the role. It's not something she's doing in a specific time or place.|0
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I've ever viewed. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it. Me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film. The plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding. The film ended quite abruptly, I'm guessing they ran out of film. Sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway. The guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder.|1
"the worst sequel I 've ever seen . really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films are . the only positive is that the movie was well acted and it was nice to see an adult movie made by teenagers . and the ending was cool as well . the rest was a disaster . and the only reason it got a 7 is because I have to agree with a lot of its opinions

The biggest problem with this movie was it was made for children. The main characters are all teenagers and it just isn’t realistic or believable for them to go on a murder spree like that."|0
No matter what other people have said you ca n't review this movie without comparing it to the original , you cant help but say it is better and better . Its really a movie you cant get out of your head . Theres nothing like it on the shelf anywhere ! And you know you have to have it , its better than all of the movies in the world . And you know whats even better . How do you feel , when your a complete and total loser and you know you are in this movie , you can't get enough of this .|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls.|1
First of all , I personally adore Demons and Demons 2 , I saw them although it was hard to get into the cinemas , but now I can get into them . The movie was a really good one and the director has put in a lot of effort into making it a decent film . I really enjoyed the story . The cinematography , acting and music were all good . There were some problems , I will not go into details in this review . If you liked it , do give it a try . The movie is also available in various languages .|0
Ben Affleck , about to be married , is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of his friends in a deadly car accident . when they get back to his home he is shocked to discover that his wife of a few months , Anne Hathaway , has been killed , leaving him a young child , his only child , who , like his mother , has never left home before . his friends are trying to get to the bottom of the incident and he starts to try to figure out why things were so messed up when the investigation finds that he and his wife had a secret love affair .|0
Wow , there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is . I usually pride myself on how well written I have been, but this movie sucked. I just couldn't take any more. I really liked the book, though, which is why I loved the movie . I can't even describe what happened to me. There was one character in the book , but I don't think I'll ever find her. I think it was a book by the same author , so I wouldn't be surprised if that character was the same .|0
"During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: ""Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? ""So, my comprehension of this movie, was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it.These are the things I found in ""Four shades of brown"". In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:1."|1
"Heh...I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T&A and the cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of ""Psycho"", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy!"|1
"This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers ""San Pedro Beach Bums"".My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a ""walk"". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...)."|1
"I just got back from ""AGS"". After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography ? Give me a break. The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?Aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't ""get it"" .... check."|1
A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died.|1
Young, ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange happenings, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it's gets to be a little much.|1
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named ""luther"". Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local Kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.Luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY tv show gets naked."|1
I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out . Just one episode . It is a show I like . There is not a lot of chemistry between the host , the two guests , the two chefs . The host is very informative about the food they serve . And the guest chefs is very humble and very kind . The host , I think has a point of view , he knows how the food should be . So , that is why I like this kind of cooking . It is not only good , but it is also beautiful .|0
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all!|1
A terrible deception : controversial film , winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003 , Mil nubes de paz turned to comedy in 2006, the first of three films to be filmed with a camera phone . The first time , I watched it was a few years ago . I had an hour-long break from my studies when I started to go to the movies , and I had seen a lot of funny movies before. But the first time I saw the film it made me want to watch all the other films that I have seen in that time and the first thing I noticed is that they are not funny.|0
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny! I am going to go back to my room, and do my laundry, then I will come back and watch Hoods at 6pm tonight. It will be awesome!!! I hope it's not too cold, I know I would like to wear a coat, so that I can stay warm. I love the sound of thunder and lightning, so that I am warm! Oh well! Thursday, December 13, 2012

Okay, so last week was pretty cold!"|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. People just don't act that way in real life situations. My question is: Who would fund such crap?The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes.|1
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is.|1
Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this film. It begins promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the U.S., this is NOT it.|1
I didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible film from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialog, music, whatsoever! I don't mind a low budget..However you have to get some point. Wandering, wondering..pointless..then two boys started kissing in bed. awful,,just awful. I love indie films, don't mind it is slow. However this movie disappointed me from any perspectives. Even the Graffito, not artistic.I was wondering what kind of people would like it.|1
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies.|1
"I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (""What if something strange is going on?""...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all."|1
Rock Star is a `` nice '' movie . Everyone is nice . Even the guys who are n't supposed to be - they are nice , they are the bad guys . Then you hear this - and you think what the hell is going on ? You can almost see it , because it's too bad that you are in the right place to see it , you know the bad guys are trying to pull some kind of move , and then all of a sudden the good guys suddenly have to say - what happened ? Where are the nukes now ?|0
... but had to see just how bad it could get. The plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. A female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. The surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'Lesbian Conspiracy'. The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby.|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too heavily on comedy. Laurel & Hardy is all about comedy and the only reason they don’t get better is because the director doesn’t give them credit for making a good comedy movie. In this film, they try too hard to make their movies funny. There are a lot of fun lines in the movie but ultimately it doesn’t make for a good movie. If they had tried to make this movie more funny, I think the movie would have been a lot more enjoyable.|0
Plodding , maybe that should have been the title . Bad dialogue delivered at a snail 's pace . All I really had to go on is the opening shot , a guy walking along in the middle of nowhere looking up at some trees , one of the most idiotic sounding scenes in cinema . And then the ending , all the characters getting killed off . Why do we have to kill each other in these movies ? And what the hell do they do all the time when they don 't get to kill each other ?|0
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be?|1
Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies , this one stinks . The usual gaggle of oversexed teens and a guy with a shotgun who thinks he's in charge are in charge of these teens. They are being led around and forced to watch and watch as the lead teen gets beaten and raped and a bunch of them end up in the woods with an axe. You know what would be cool though? To see a bunch of other guys beating a bunch of girls to a pulp and a bunch of them ending up in a cabin with an axe in their hands.|0
"I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot . It was very watchable and very funny . The plot was a bit confusing at the beginning and I thought it was a bit slow at certain points. I would definitely recommend it. If you have any thoughts about the movie, let me know them in the comments. And of course, feel free to write reviews on it as well 🙂

If you enjoy films that are really funny and are good at suspense, you will like this. I would highly recommend this movie ."|0
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie , but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline , it feels like an average action film and the characters just stand off the screen .I really thought there would be a lot of depth to it, but no. Pulp has no depth whatsoever. The acting was really, really bad, and the characters did nothing but talk to each other and say "" I'm going to kill you"" , which I found extremely disturbing . It was extremely annoying. The story wasn't good , the action was just really, really, really boring."|0
"There 's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by a fan base that knows it doesn't belong. ""We all want to see a good Gothic film, but what if the director just doesn't have the nerve to finish it?"" That's exactly what happens in The Shining, one of the scariest movies you will ever see. After the events of the first act, Jack Nicholson and his friends are sent into the woods to ""help"" a grieving group of young boys who have all been brutally murdered by a madman."|0
This turned out to be more of a women 's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was .... simply because the subject matter wasn't about love or passion. Instead, it was about how it affected the heroine's family. I think it would be easy to blame the film's plot for this, but it was really the plot that led me down this path. It made me realize that I don't know enough about the genre to properly critique it. It's hard to know whether what I'm seeing on the screen was real or just made-up stuff.|0
"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece."|1
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB . The movie was bad but the reviews weren't. I read a lot of reviews. I know the general consensus of the movie was that the movie was poorly written. That's why I didn't review the movie on IMDB, I just watched it and posted some of the thoughts on it on my website. What struck me about the reviews I read for this movie was the fact that many reviewers said the film would be a better movie if it were written better but it was really bad.|0
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date , this year , it is one of my favorites . The story , the acting , the plot , the music . So many reasons to go and see it . Well i loved it as well but then again i love all sci fi and fantasy movies. I think it was a good sequel to a great movie. However , it still needs a sequel . It is a little bit slow to the film but not enough to ruin the movie. I really did enjoy this movie. I am not saying that it is good but it IS good.|0
This movie is # 1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen , with `` Lessons for Love '' the worst movie you will ever see in my entire life I have watched every single episode of the TV series on my DVD player after I finished the movie, but the only one I actually enjoyed was the second part, that was the best movie I have ever watched! I watched the entire first part in one night and the second in one night and I still have my DVD player from the second time, because I felt the whole movie was fake.|0
If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished!|1
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. The actors - I think all of them are amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it.Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. The lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: ""I´m the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual."|1
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y.|1

In terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen . The list of inaccuracies goes on. I’m sure I can do better, but I just don’t see it as being all that accurate. Also, it’s been a few months since I wrote this, but let me state that this is NOT a review . I am NOT a film critic and don’t claim to be . I just like a film and wanted to get a list of all the inaccuracies, which I did.|0
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed.|1
"This one was truly awful . Watching with fascinated horror , I kept on asking `` why have they done that ?'' This guy was obviously not as smart as his image. He didn't know the difference between the words `` we'' and `` we have made you''

I can imagine that he would be a very successful businessman , I just don't see that he was that smart . If he was , he'd have learnt something. It's funny , but I've been saying that for ages , and you still just keep giving the same reasons ."|0
"I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher wasn't involved with this ""movie"". An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't make an appearance in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs."|1
Of course I am going to think it was a great movie . I recognized several people I did n't know from their film work . I was a kid when this movie came out . The only thing I didn't know is the name , so I had to search for the film . I found it on youtube . I'm hoping you can find a copy . Thank you for your reply , I'm glad I found it . You may see it on here . I would appreciate your response . Thank you once again .|0
"First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie ""Embryo"" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Okay, in all honestly, I didn't know all this, but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of ""Embryo"" could have done."|1
"So im not a big fan of Boll 's work but then again not many are . I enjoyed his work and am happy to have found his work at the library

A lot of this is the fault of the internet and the internet itself. It has become a breeding ground for a lot of bad writing. If there is something that you have to say, and you can say it in an honest and open manner, then people will take it seriously. Then people will get angry, and if they're angry, then people will start shouting."|0
A brash , self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a rare moment of candor the narrator admits that his father worked for the CIA . He also claims that, while he believes the world was saved by the Soviets, they didn’t save it for long enough to save him. But he knows that it’s better to blame it on the “evil system” than to admit his own role, as he does in the first scene, in helping save his father.|0
Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain.|1
"Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak). The ""cold-turkey"" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from Saul Bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein."|1
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow, I didn't find him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' Bruno Anthony.Overall, I would highly recommend this.|1
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others. I was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. I still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half.|1
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies , mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond . His work was also used in many films and TV serials and documentaries about the Italian Mafia, and many of these works are still very popular among people. In one of his films , Fulci plays a vampire who tries to survive in a real world that he is not supposed to live in. In another, he is a serial killer and in another he is the main villain of the whole film. In still another part, he is a murderer with the power of telepathy.|0
"The only pure life , is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway , a young writer in his early thirties in a Tokyo suburb in 1972, on a summer break from college, his first novel to be published since 1958's ""Toward the Final Battle"". A book he would return to, over the course of many years, as an essay and film , before his final masterpiece in 2000. Now published in its entirety (in English) and in Japanese by New Directions (Dover Books) as The Buried Giant - The Novels of Mishima."|0
"I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.I would highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.I turned off the TV during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. Calling it ""pathetic"" is a gross understatement."|1
"There were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly Milton Berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear ""In The Mood"" one more time I'll puke.This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her."|1
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. There is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. Our actress are treated like pieces of ass, and seem to be perfectly happy with their position. The lead characters, these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.|1
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures . If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky the name is then the film is disgusting . If it is any indication as to how this film was made I'm sure that a few of you have read a few of my reviews about this film so I won't be surprised if there is a bit of spoiler for you as to where this review will end up. It's not going to be pretty . Let me tell you right off the bat that this is a movie that will be disturbing to you.|0
The greatest movie ever.How's that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time.|1
Everyone has their choice for `` worst movie they 've ever seen . '' Some like to pick on Gigli - but there is one movie I like a lot . . . I think I'll start at the beginning: Gigli, the documentary by Robert De Niro and Robert De Niro , is based upon the life of actor and director Robert De Niro . De Niro , in a role which he played in several of my favorite films in the 1970s, has said in interviews that he never really wanted to be an actor, but wanted to play a character .|0
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy . It 's hardly a comedy , I don't know what it is , I don't watch it , and neither do you. However , I find this film to be very much of its time. This is the same film that was released in 1953, just a few years later. In fact this was also one of the first horror/comedy movies that was made. Good Humor Man was directed by William Witney who was already famous for his work on the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|0
The series does not start as it means to go on . Although it 's first two seasons are crammed to the gills with action and romance, you need to get out to a place where the action is quiet. The first three episodes of this new series were shot and edited in New York, and so the series takes place a little over 5 years after the last one ended. It starts out with two of the main characters, Ethan Cressy (Colin Baker) and his wife, Sara (Cate Blanchett), getting together.|0
"This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots , dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly. The first scene has an eerie effect on you. The second one is quite disturbing and it really makes you question things that are not clearly explained. I thought it was an excellent film and I can't wait for more! First of all, I would like to congratulate on the first movie of the series, ""V for Vendetta"" which I saw in theaters on the weekend of April 1st. The movie is great and the story is interesting and well told."|0
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are to late. Apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. I'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to Curse of the Komodo which also sucked. The computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves.|1
It 's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead , this has solidity in every aspect . not much action in here , a little romance , a few good lines ,and a good plot . but still , i like that it is a romantic comedy . it will appeal to anyone , it does not need much plot . and it does not have to make you laugh , it is just a romantic comedy , it can be light and funny even with the romantic comedy . this movie is fun .|0
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles . Even if you attempt to follow the official story of LA’s recent eruptive activity, you are immediately thrown head-long into yet another mind-bogglingly insane story. What is the story? The story revolves around the recent eruptions at the La Brea Tar Pits. As you read along, you will undoubtedly hear one or two or three or four of the following, or some combination of them, but it is impossible for any one story to be told with complete precision.|0
Unfortunately a boring flick, and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is. The leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant, charming and sexy, forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with. The dame herself merely walks through the flick, being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute.|1
"This is, arguably, the worst of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous. But that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he's Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (! ), and Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a major popular song, ""Speak Low."""|1
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: There are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that I spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity.|1
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The finest performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for ANY reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares the hell out me today.|1
"This is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The lead part Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This film is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l Abner strip! The problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the ""love story"" might make your head hurt."|1
If you can stomach the campiness , this movie should make you laugh out loud several times . It did for me . The acting was average to good , but you have to like it to like it . The story had me laughing and wanting to see where it would go for the rest of this series . The first movie was fun , but now the sequel is better , with the same characters , same story and the same humor . I liked the first movie , but this sequel was so much better , that it makes the first movie almost worthless .|0
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the ""war on terror"" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface."|1
"This noisy, dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy, who could have tackled the role played by Mr. Stone, the team doctors, or the ""fruitcake"" selling cereal. If you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. The film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some MTV-styled music video scenes."|1
"Okay , now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from . I do believe they can’t take any of us seriously . I did like that part about the cop looking down at the screen and not seeing anything … ” oh that’s my wife!” … ” you’re a cop. What do you want!”

I’ll probably watch this movie again. I was hoping it had been released before the election but I think it was only released around the first of the year so hopefully this will make it to the top of the box office list."|0
I tried watching this movie, but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part.|1
"After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers , the agent Sonni Griffith (Gaby Hoffmann) infiltrates a secret society called the ‘League’ and becomes a member. In the midst of an investigation into the activities of this group, Griffith discovers that it is actually a criminal organization that has been hiding its true motives.

This is a semi fictional memoir of an `` international man '' who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent years. The memoir of one of the most powerful people in Pakistan, is the autobiography of a `` global man '' who have witnessed major political revolutions in recent years. This book is a detailed description of what it is like to be a `` world man '' who has lived and seen all kinds of political upheavals in recent years. He has experienced everything from war and peace to economic hardship and social upheaval, in which he got involved, and has been a participant in many of the political revolutions.|0
I normally do n't like romantic films , but I love this film very much . The story is really very well told . You will not get tired of seeing this film . I don't like to say much , except to say , that I was very pleased with this movie . I think it has a good plot . And it has an excellent score too . I like the story . If you want an excellent romantic film , I recommend you to go watch this movie . I know you won't find another such film in the world .|0
One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore , `` Ten Cents a Dance '' stars Barbara Stanwyck as a stripper played by Lionel Barrymore (the leading man) . She plays herself, but in a very different way , and the film has all of Lionel Barrymore's old movies at his fingertips. Barrymore was also an actor whose career was inextricably linked to that of the leading ladies he played. Barbara Stanwyck was born July 15, 1906 in New Orleans, La., and was raised in New York by her father who was an accountant.|0
"Sorry about that. But if you have seen this ""epic"", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but I do know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the Earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways."|1
First off , the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I do n't understand how was it allowed , the reason being is that this was supposed to be a children's story with an adult cast , this was not the case . I do not understand this . So please explain to me , what was wrong with it . The original story was about three very naughty boys who were having fun with a younger boy . The older kid was the leader of the gang, the youngest of the boys was the follower .|0
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered to the four winds, you would think that you are a part of some kind of church or mosque or cult. Instead you find that the religion that you worship is more like the cult that you are trying to distance yourself from. But why is this? I feel the same way about Islam as a religion. I am so disgusted by the religion that I don't want to believe in it. Why then would I go to a mosque?|0
The positives: It's shot pretty well. Has some interesting peripheral characters. Likable main character (albeit weak).The bad: Plot/story. Editing. Characters wasted. Jessica Alba.I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I don't dislike Jessica Alba--I really wanted to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable.|1
Frederick Forsyth 's books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise . I'm a fan of Frederick Forsyth's books and can't wait to see what he writes next . He's a one-book writer and I would highly recommend giving him a listen . I read this in one sitting , so I know there is a story to be told . I am very excited . This novel is a good example of what can be done when a story is told well, and this novel will have readers wanting to reread it again .|0
I am very impressed by the reviews I 've read of this film - generally well-read , thoughtful and informed. I've seen a few things about this film and think you might get the same response, but you might have a different view, or a different opinion. To be honest I'm not going to spend the time to read all the reviews, as I think it will be a bit of a slog. There are some good points and I think you'd be wise to consider some of them in the first place. I like it.|0
This is one of the most unoriginal , cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen . Even if you did n't know about the plot, you'll find it hard to watch without feeling the need to laugh at the cliche plot devices and the general absurdity of the characters involved . This film has nothing new to offer . There are no characters you would recognize . I was disappointed that this was only available on home media. This movie should have been available on the big screen . I do not recommend that you purchase this movie . I did not like this movie , and it has nothing to do with me .|0
Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes , hit each other over rocks with sticks and threw spears to see who was stronger. But it wasn’t until the dawn of civilization did they actually learn to use tools. After the development of tools and writing the Bible, the human race began to learn to make them and use them. Over the years we have moved from making tools to learning to make them. This includes learning to use the bow and arrows, pot, and cooking tools. It has been quite a journey.|0
It 's true , no one really expects anything from sequels . But even by that low standard this is a pretty good effort . I like how the film keeps you guessing at who is real , and who isn't . You have to look at every aspect of the story , which is a bit tricky to do in a sequel . I would have been more impressed if the film was less predictable , as some have suggested. But it isn't a bad sequel by any means . Still , it has it's flaws . This is a solid film , worth checking out .|0
"""Chupacabra Terror"" is saved from a '1"" by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of THE RELIC. John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. He does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome."|1
"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. ""You Are Alone"" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!!"|1
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens , and more contemporary works like the Stephen King books or the Stephen King movie trilogy, which are still very popular today. However, it also has a great deal to recommend it, not only as a great movie, but also for the wonderful costumes and sets they’ve chosen for the film. I think the sets were one of the things that set the film apart from others like it — not only because of the great acting, but also because they were so beautifully designed and decorated.|0
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive.In its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film.|1
Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation ? The whole `` Complete Jane Austin '' series as we know them. It’s all there. There’s more. There are no spoilers in this article. It’s all out there. Here it is. But I want to do this anyway. What I want to do, in a very roundabout way, is present you, if you’ve been following this project in some capacity, with an idea of how to read the Jane Austin universe.|0
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrised in all my life.|1
"I'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie:#1 Angelina Jolie sex scene #2 Foley artist outdid themselves #3 plot was quite thick #4 DVD does includes trailers and chapter stops#5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie #6 homages to blade runner through out the film #7 burning trash cans #8 funny guy with no legs #9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the film. #10 Sage advise, for example ""When you dine with the devil bring a long spoon""."|1
"Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, ""Meet John Doe"" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital."|1
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother. I think he's very good at what he does and can do, but he can't hide that he does it from people for the wrong reasons. I'm not saying I'm going to agree with everything he says, but that he's a good writer. He's not afraid to tell his personal feelings about a movie or character in a bad light, he's not afraid to be honest, so I can't say he sucks at it.|0
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success `` The Gay Divorce '' ( a title which was considered too scandalous for television). In the early 1970s, a new format, the ``Broadway Family Hour,'' was launched in New York to replace The Gay Divorce, as well as other long-running primetime programs, such as The Philco Hour, the ABC Family Playhouse and the Merv Griffin Show. This new show, which is now seen almost exclusively on public television in the United States, was broadcast on ABC's ""Duck Dynasty,"" a half-hour children's sitcom, from 1998 to 2003."|0
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career.|1
"In my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever. People started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People went nutty, demons were possessing people, all kinds of fun. Of course then it all went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the ""third testament"" in five days, but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy."|1
Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked ! Now , her book `` Breaking Dawn '' will not be published any more , she is very disappointed. I mean , she was so thrilled when the first trailer was released . Now , the movie has already been released. It is an amazing movie . And the trailer for it is the bomb! I can't wait to see the movie . I bet it will be so great . I am sure it will be really good . It will also make her happy !|0
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class. And some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. AND FAILED.That is my only explanation for this, this, thing. Good God they left the date and time counter on during some of it. The picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot.|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. That was kind of a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it.|1
While not as bad as some movies ( like the horrible `` Atomic Twister '' ) , `` Meltdown '' has a lot of fun going on in it. The story takes place in a town in Germany where the only thing that is ever good about it is, well , beer! A group of Germans who are not too bright try to do their job right, and try to change the world for a little bit by making the city better. Things don't go as planned, and it leads to a group of young people from a town that is just a bit too different.|0
I 'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes , so I watched this show when it came out and had high hopes to be a part of it but I was so disappointed. There are so many mistakes made in this movie that I can't even begin to list the ones I found. The story itself isn't bad at all, but this movie is so poorly written and directed that I couldn't even watch it because of its terrible writing and direction. If you love to see movies that don't suck, I would recommend this movie to absolutely everyone.|0
Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. And, as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is no where to be found. Instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character.|1
... but you probably have seen it or else you would n't be here . It 's so obscure that I have no clue who this person is or how to describe his/her/their work. So I will describe a little of his work for you, and this description may be quite a bit different from what he actually says. I hope you find it interesting if I may, but please do not tell me who you are and where to find them. They are in my blogroll so please follow them. I hope that some day they will write about you, or I will.|0
"""Mr. Bug Goes To Town"" was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with assistance by Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White for Disney. Harline's ""atmospheric music"" is superb, and a treat for the ears.The layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the Fleischer's background artists outdid themselves."|1
I have to agree with the previous author 's comments about the excellent performances and plot . Started watching this anime when it aired last month. I didn't want to put it down. I'm glad I did because I've been wanting to see the ending. The characters are awesome and I'd like to see how they will do in an end. Also, one thing I was looking for but couldn't find is the name of the guy in the school uniform ( I know it's the only character to not take it off ).|0
"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. It came no wonder for me that this is admired by most American viewers and hated by Europeans. This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.You have been warned. It doesn't even have ""guilty pleasure"" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.I wish I could enter negative values, admins?"|1
I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say , `` Ben Johnson ? ! '' - he was a Canadian. They didn't ask for it. They didn't ask for our country. And when we ask for our country they don't know. They don't know. It doesn't work like that, they just know they don't get it. They just do. So, that's why I say you have to go on and you have to fight for it, because they don't even know it. You have to say, `` We know it.|0
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn't have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys.|1
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines????? ), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film."|1
It 's 1913 . A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood 's next great love. He follows her all night to the theater, from the beginning of the play until her curtain call, and she is always the best dressed. When she returns home, she is different. She doesn 't dress as often, doesn 't have her own maid, doesn 't always have her shoes polished, and even if she does, not always the right way. But one night, she meets someone she ' s never expected to meet.|0
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since that gay kid (Ben) came along, this show has sucked. The writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse.|1
No , no , no . That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. It’s one of those films that we can all agree is good and will bring a little something different to an audience that might have otherwise been bored. While it’s a little confusing at first, the more you think about it, the more you’ll come around. It’s an extremely funny movie and it makes for a very interesting viewing experience. This is a great film that will blow you away if you look for it.|0
Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence.|1
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew.|1
I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot!|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after this, rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You'll see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.|1
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The ill-fated Payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the African jungle where she lives on husband Cavanaugh's plantation: doctor Conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman Burr's approach is, quite literally, more hands-on.|1
It seems like an exciting prospect , a modern-dress `` Othello '' with Christopher Eccleston , who was so frighteningly good as the title character in the film . It was also his first full-length role. And the film was based on an original book , by Stephen Gwynn-Jones . And in addition, it was directed by the Oscar-winner , who starred in his first film , and directed in the process. It seems as though he would be a good choice to helm a new version of ` Othello . After all, we know this story so well already and we know it will continue to make us laugh .|0
A small-town schoolteacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! Soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (Samuel L. Jackson).This was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? After all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was an all-around good time.|1
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a cast containing such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. HOWEVER, I am so glad that I did view this film as I now have the memorable saying 'Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by.|1
Wrestlemania 6 , is an entertaining Wrestlemania , if not an entirely successful one . The Ultimate Challenge , is one of the highlights of the show , with over 60 wrestlers battling it out in the first match of the night for the WWE Championship . The match also featured the tag teams of the Undertaker , Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin , who would later form the tag team of Stone Cold , Kane and Christian . This would be followed by the WWE World Heavyweight Championship , which will be defended for the second time by Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kane , and the WWE Cruiserweight Championship .|0
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. The acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid.|1
... I ca n't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... This is such a slow movie that you really wonder if anybody is even watching this. If they are, they might as well be doing it on a napkin. As always, there is such a disconnect between the story in the script, and the film that I couldn't tell if I was really watching this or watching a movie I just had to see. I understand that I need to get into it but I think there's just enough of it to get to know what this is.|0
It 's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure , it 's horror and I liked that . But it also has elements of comedy , drama , and social commentary all wrapped in a neat package. And yes , it does a decent job at it all, and it has a lot to say, and it doesn 't sugar-coat it either.But unfortunately, it does a bad job of all three, and this is due to the story itself, and how it plays itself out on the screen .|0
"I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It is a great story and told extremely well. I fell absolutely in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""? (money). That was classic. ; )."|1
The basic plot is good and can be engaging . The music is so great that it became the theme song for The Amazing Spider-Man . It's not perfect by any means and there are many songs I would like to change but overall, the movie was worth a watch. The acting was very good and a lot of it could be a credit to the cast. There was a few things that bothered me but nothing really seemed to bother the audience and I think most people would give this a very favorable review but I think I would rate it as less than average.|0
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with.|1
"""The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. The dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'The Phantom Killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Milton Raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit."|1
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town and in one of the few movie theaters I have been able to see since I moved here. Not only does it have great acting throughout the entire story, but also, a great plot to boot. It is my favorite film I have ever seen! I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone in any form of entertainment! This movie was so good. Not only do I rate this movie a 3 but also a perfect 10 because I really loved this movie so much and the acting is fantastic.|0
I did n't even watch this whole movie . Now , I like 50 's sci-fi movies even when they don 't involve aliens. I have no complaints . I have a few issues with 50 's films, however , and some of them are pretty bad. The first is the script , which is very bad. I think 50 's writers wrote a bad script from the get go . 50 's scripts tend to be very confusing . This script was confusing and hard to follow . I don 't know if the story is supposed to be a sci-fi story , or if it is just another story of aliens .|0
"Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the ""Toymaker's"" family. And, that's about it."|1
I 'm not a big musical fan , but this is one of the few I really love . Unlike many others that I've listened to I really like the style of this band and their overall performance . The instruments they play all sound really nice . It's a very good show and very well done , especially for its size . The band consists of 4 musicians (1 male and 3 females) with a total length of about 27 minutes. All of the instruments are played with some really nice technique and the songs are all sung by their lead singer (female) .|0
I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it . It was an improvement on my original, but I think I would prefer this. After watching this video, I decided to get in a fight against someone in the park. I took off my shoes before I went in to do this, and I'm glad I did. It felt so much better walking around in my new sneakers than I did on my normal shoes. I took a lot of photos. This is why I don't feel bad about walking around in sneakers at work.|0
Secret Service agent Jay Killion ( Charles Bronson ) has been assigned to protect the President-elect 's wife , the Vice President , Ivanka Trump , in the aftermath of the Russian election hack , which has revealed classified details of her life and career . Ivanka Trump has been called ‘ the most guarded woman in America ‘ . It's not fair , but the truth is that she's guarded more than her husband . A lot more than she's been able to hide. Ivanka and the President-elect have been married for nearly a year.|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed . From the opening scene of TFW to the ending, it had no doubt been a very, very long time coming. And yet we have a story that seems to have no end. Not even a vague idea of how the war is supposed to end. In fact, TFW ends with no explanation whatsoever, with no indication that the world has ended. We know it’s coming, but there is absolutely nothing in sight to point us in the direction of what to expect from the story.|0
I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst film ever. It had some interesting ideas, but it’s the acting that made it truly awful. I’ve seen the film many, many times and still can’t seem to shake the memory of it. The first time I watched, I found it really difficult to watch, it seemed so dark and grim. I knew it was a bad film as soon as I saw the trailer.|0
I have n't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made ! Talk about a film with a huge cast and crew that didn't want to work for a day or two before finding themselves in a terrible accident ! The script was written in a rush from day one, with no one given a chance to polish it in between, just so everyone can get a cheap laugh and sell a few DVD's ? ! Thats the same script that ended up winning the best picture Academy Award this year.|0
I ca n't believe I even tried to watch this filth . As an avid B-Horror movie fan , I was completely disgusted with this film . Why didn't anyone make a film about this? It is the type of film that can be done only with the most hardcore horror fan . I don't give a crap what some people say , but as an amateur , I've never seen anything that has the level of disgusting filth that this film is capable of . The only good thing that comes to my mind about it is the fact that this film is the only horror that has ever crossed my radar.|0
Yet again , director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick . This is not your father's B-movie , but with the right director and screenplay , this is definitely something you don't see every day . The movie is based on true story , the story is based on , and you can see it all here , check it out here , or read the article on Wikipedia , here , just don't expect to see any violence , this is very PG-13 . It is definitely a movie that will make you want to kill , and have a good time doing it .|0
it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful.|1
"Anyone that is looking for an episode of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI"" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.A murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently."|1
The girls might be prettier if you 're their accompanist or a $ # ! +-faced onlooker . What I think is more likely is that you're not paying too much attention . What do they do to get attention ? You're the one telling them . You have a job, you have an audience . You have to pay attention. You're supposed to be a professional! Look at all the time you spend worrying about it, and all the trouble it makes you to spend your precious free time worrying about it.|0
Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.Audio/Video: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks.|1
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.Where does this film go wrong?|1
"I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering the most terrible circumstances imaginable. But I thought that the main difference between them is the fact Memento is an RPG whereas Novo is a survival horror, so maybe there is something that makes the difference. But what I don't get why Novo would be considered a ""game"" and Memento would be considered a ""horror"" game, because both of them are in the same genre, and there is a huge difference between both, which I can't understand."|0
An obvious cash-in on the *Insert Monster Here* On A Plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you'd expect it to be. The film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. Although, it is fun in parts, I must say. The Zombie-action is particularly entertaining. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel.|1
What crack are you smoking? This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! The action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, I just about peed myself. I could go on...Entertaining, arguably so. Good, no. Well made, certainly not.As a commentary on America as empire, it's actually pretty good.|1
Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I had n't known that I would have called it porn I would probably have never seen it. The plot is pretty good for a movie. A young couple is in the throes of passion with each other. After they break up they have sex in the bathroom of a hotel room. Later that night, they try to sneak out of the hotel room and have a drink at a bar. They are interrupted by the hotel bellman. They have to go to the next door room to make sure that their room isn't occupied.|0
This is a pretty simplistic romance . Girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl falls in love . Boy has a big heart for girl . Girl wants him as much as he wants to be with her . Boy wants to be the one guy she'll love forever . It's a pretty good romance that I thought. The story was very enjoyable . The only issue that I had was that I missed a few things. I also thought the romance went a little overboard at the end of the story. I thought it was a little rushed .|0
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue, to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle!|1
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work.|1
Well , this is about as good as they come . There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a producer or a writer or a director but the point is that he produced a film that is widely regarded as one of the best in the past decades and is also among his best. There is a movie that I have just seen, and it is very good, and I would recommend you watch it . I was at an art exhibit and I was talking to one of the people there and it was like she had known him for years.|0
With its rerelease by ADV Films , I 've had a chance to watch `` The Giant Majin '' for the past year. Now I feel the time is ripe to give it another chance. What do I have to say? Well, for one, I want to point out that the movie has been well received, and I 'm glad that I did see it. If you saw it, I hope this is what it 's coming out of you. For instance, I like the way the action is paced. I have to say, I like this movie too.|0
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking.|1
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. Poirot in the Hollow is my favorite play for many reasons but I would say one of them is this. For the first time ever you can see a full length of the original stage play that was created by Irene Castle. This is my first experience seeing the play and I loved every second of it! Agatha Christie wrote the most famous play, the “Hollow” and I know I will be a huge fan of it!|0
"Okay,I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this!I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD!!!! !This film is so darn bad!I never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but I did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!"|1
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish!. Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget.|1
Breathtaking at it 's best , intriguing at it 's worst , Francis Ford Coppala 's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is a true classic of the cinematic canon. The story follows two Americans who are sent to a remote island to investigate a series of mysterious murders and the bizarre rituals associated with the so-called 'pyramids of Mars.' The film is based on the book 'Viking Legacy: A Novel by John Connolly' which is one of my favorite books ever written. It is not, however, one of my favorite movies because it doesn't do nearly enough for the story in a single movie.|0
Thomas Mann 's controversial novel is the basis for the film `` A Death in Venice. `` Although in the film the character played by John Wayne is the same as the one played by Bruce Lee in the `` Bruce Lee vs. Bruce Lee `` action film starring Bruce Lee in the lead. This is the same Bruce Lee of the comic book, however this is not the same comics Bruce Lee, this Bruce Lee in the film is a fictional Bruce Lee, the same comic book comic book Bruce Lee, this is a film about a fictional film character.|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy , but also the best of the trilogy. One of the reasons it has such a positive reception is that it gives the viewers a more in depth and complete look into the life of the trio and their relationship with themselves. It also makes the audience feel as if they have stepped back and seen it first hand, rather than just having to read about it. The actors are great and the story itself has a great story-line. I found it an enjoyable and worthwhile film that is easy to watch, with some interesting twists along the way.|0
The book is great . It 's one of my favorite books ever . The film , on the other hand , is one of the most boring . It doesn' t have much of anything to say and the movie is not well thought out at all . I don' t like the book either , but that' s only because I like the book but not the film . I know the book is not well written and there is nothing original or exciting about it but that' s not what made me love the book . I really don' t think there is anything to learn from it .|0
I had heard good things about `` States of Grace '' and came in with an open mind . I had a few questions and decided to try it for two weeks. I tried it, but it was no good. I thought that I would read some books that I would love to get a hold of and would be happy to spend money on my next trip. It was not to be. After two weeks of trying to read the book I finally decided to give it a try. What I learned is that it was really hard to read, very boring and full of typos.|0
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. Half the scenes are pointless. There is not an inkling of character development. The score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie yet I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances.|1
Oh how awfully this movie is! I don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! The story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat.|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.|1
In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).His camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist.|1
"This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. It is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. And that comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so flipping bad, it made ""Hulk"" (The second worst movie ever) look like ""The Departed"" (One of the greatest movies in cinematic history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie."|1
I went to see this because I 'd never seen Tel-Aviv , where the story is set . I was very impressed, the characters, the setting, and the style of writing is perfect . I 'm sure you'll love it as well . And I 'll recommend you to see it , it's so great ! You have no idea who wrote this and you were very impressed? And how many of us are going to see this? This is a movie that may get a couple of million dollars. Is there anyone who will go see this, let alone buy it?|0
"Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who's the working definition of the word ""dreamer"" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California.Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.Could be better, could be worse.I gave this one seven out of ten."|1
**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PLOT ****Woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . Oh did I mention the rape victim was mute ? That`s the problem with MS 45 , Thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? Surely the whole film would have better if we had Thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ?|1
The great thing about Thirst , Chanwook Park 's latest film , is that it 's the anti-Twilight . Some have likened it to ' The Hunger Games ' , while others, like Jodi Benson, say it 's an ' Inception '. But the fact is, it has no equal , no matter how many people you know who 've been disappointed by Twilight or Inception . That 's because, while each movie has its own story and characters, both are based on franchises . They 're stories about two people falling in love and becoming one.|0
"A CBS radio program entitled ""We the People"" assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who is ""studying"" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Ms. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. Immediately."|1
"This film was really terrible.However , it 's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene.And I love the ending . I liked that it left it open till the end . -

It is a film, directed by Timo Savioni.It has been released in 2000 in Germany on DVD, and in 2002 on Blu-Ray.It has been screened twice on TV.It was nominated for 3 Golden Globe Awards, winning for best picture, director, and screenwriting.It had a worldwide release in 2001, and a North American DVD and VHS release in 2002. I don't know why people say that this film was awful."|0
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. Canada becomes part of the USA. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the USA. Silly me. Continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South have to be among the most imaginative series ever.|1
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked . It 's a crime drama where a man gets out of prison because he was wrongfully imprisoned , and he begins to make amends to his ex girlfriend and her family. Rififi is an amazing film because it takes the story and makes it believable. The film opens with a close up of a group of men and women standing outside a building , as the camera pans to one of the people , who looks up to a man dressed as a priest and wearing a white hoodie , who is praying in his head.|0
Watched this film at a local festival , the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film , and with great production value! This film follows two couples through their relationship. It was filmed on location in Florida and Arizona in the early 80s and I found it very moving, especially since I was the same age in the 80s and 80s. This is a great film , and it was a pleasure to see the couple on screen. I also loved the fact that so many of the women in the film played themselves.|0
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis, he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing.|1
"CAUTION : SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times , the brilliant scenery , richness of the characters , and heartwarming moments are well worth the investment of the time and money to see it..

What I was looking for :1. Great story2. Great acting3. Great acting skills4. Great music and soundtrack5. The plot is a good balance between action and comedy6. The characters all have one thing in common- they all want to win the world.7. The ending was a pleasant ending for a good story8. It is a movie which is worth seeing9."|0
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot doesn't follow on the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense.|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. He is often alone and used to it. He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters who speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is.|1
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb , so even I sensed something rotten in it 's synopsis I decided to watch the movie as it opened. I didn't expect it to hold such a high review , but the way it ended and the story is not very interesting I was hoping for something better. I am still waiting for this movie to come out though I am pretty sure this film will have to wait a long time for release. This is an original work of fiction, based on a true story. The characters and locations mentioned in the movie are fictitious.|0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film. In the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. Despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama.|1
The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84).|1
This movie was * good * relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story , from 3 points of view , the main character is not the main character but the other 3 points of view in a story. And all the points of the story are related by each other. But in the second part of the movie, i can't tell you about the story, it's not that good , but in the end, it was okay. It was okay .But the first part of it was really good.|0
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I seriously don't think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not.|1
"This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. After a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.We are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. During this stage the film heightens tension with strange ""plinky plinky"" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing."|1
This movie was pathetically awful . The sound was terrible , the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. I am not going to say that I would not have liked it if its not this awful, but its definitely one I wont be making fun of and I am sure it would be fun for me to see again. I saw this movie on opening night for my birthday. After seeing it the first time I didn't want to see it again. The movie was not good. This is why I didn't watch it that night.|0
Why ca n't a movie be rated a zero ? Or even a negative number ? Some movies such as The Godfather, The Terminator or even The Passion are rated a 1/2+ ,and other ones are rated a 3.5. I'm not saying these movies are better than those. I'm saying that it is not a good system to use. Just a question. The Godfather, The Terminator, and the Passion, are not bad movies. I'm not saying they are not good. The Godfather is in my opinion a great film.|0
All right , let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64 . The graphics were very good , especially the new ones from a few years back. They just never quite reached the levels I wanted them to. I liked the 3D models a lot , the new ones have been improved but I don't think I'm ever going to use those anymore. I don't see a problem with using the 64 and 64 GBs. If that were the case, then we would all be stuck with 32 GBs and no 64. We will still have 16GBs available.|0
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success ""The Gay Divorce"" (a title which was considered too scandalous for American moviegoers, though it was used in the U.K.) concerns a man and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. Betty Grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number ""Let's K-nock K-nees"" with overtly sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout."|1
"Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90 's flicks? (and that was already a bad thing)

I think I might be going off track here but I can not think of any good reasons why we are not doing the same for our show. I think the reason that we are doing it is that we have a very good reason - we are trying to emulate the style of old 90s and early 00's movies/tv/shows and we feel that it will be much cooler than anything that comes out now."|0
I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel like I'm watching something from a bad 90s sitcom. And what's with the bad acting? I guess I just don't see any talent. It seems like all the actresses in this film are really bad and not really likeable, but I don't really know that to be true. I just don't like anything about this movie. It just seems really cheesy. I mean, I know you can make a movie out of anything.|0
My Mother Frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill).Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight.|1
"This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of ""we're just a bunch of wacky guys"" in the midst of the ""my goodness this can be really dangerous"" parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn't bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.Thing is I'm a John Travolta fan."|1
I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. What was John Landis thinking?I know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! Even kids hate this movie. It's pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.I think the only reason The Stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.|1
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's Seattle Film Fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of Gershwin, Cole Porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards.|1
Hello all ! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would 've given an excellent performance in the film. I was quite happy for him in a movie where he acted very well, but this is one of his worst role in a movie, I do not think I will watch the sequel to this movie because he is not so great in this one..I was so upset after watching the movie, please help me to appreciate the performance of the actors, it was not so great.. I can't watch his other role because I didn't think this was so bad..|0
"Televised in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the ""greats"" of the American Musical form listen to this."|1
I love this movie . At first , I did n't expect much of this movie since I did n't believe that they could produce such a good picture. It was very entertaining . However , the ending was pretty lame , I was disappointed , but still i enjoyed it . I did n't think the plot was really interesting . The plot , the characters were so stereotypical . The first half of the movie is very good . The acting was very well done . It was a good time , and the storyline was fairly interesting . I did n't find any flaws in the script .|0
This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development.|1
"Something not-so-great. ""Silence of the Lambs"" remains Demme's only good film, and I'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which I haven't seen - and never will.This is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. The first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. His animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny."|1
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. First the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street!! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than that of Memphis.|1
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist, helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best, but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieves some poignancy, but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury, a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting.|1
Eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. This movie shows a good aspect on the human body being God's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. Actress/model Inger Ebeltoft's impersonation of Eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress being Eve.|1
"Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as ""a gherkin in a burger"". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die."|1
I know my summary sounds very harsh , but this film has very limited appeal . The average Joe out there wouldn't understand a word I'm saying and most of his neighbors probably wouldnt understand this one either. And thats what really kills it. So I can't recommend this film to them. The movie has a few flaws but in the main it has the quality of a classic. I really like how they made this film more of an action movie rather than a comedy and the way they filmed the action shots. It gives the movie a real feeling.|0
While many pass this off as a B movie it is , indeed , a first class comedy that is based on a true story. The story revolves around an American college student who gets a job opportunity for a high profile lawyer and decides not to go because he doesn't want a title in front of his name as a lawyer. He then decides to take a job on the side to pay his own way and take on a case, which is what he is doing now. But then a woman comes to his office who he thinks is going to be an attorney.|0
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure , the image of the cranes that are the symbol of the film. They are the very symbol of the point of departure, as well as the symbol of the film. It is a symbol which, in itself, has to be seen by the audience to understand the film in the same way that we do. The crane symbol is a symbol that has been used by films since ancient times and it is a very common symbol in many of the movies that I am talking about in my blog post.|0
My mom and I , rented this movie . I mean , we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks , and I really liked it . I was not so sure about it , but I’ll give it a chance . I’d like to know if any of you had the same issue . I’m only going to watch the first 2/3 of it so I don’t have a chance to give it too much of a bad review . I also don’t want people to get a copy of it and spoil it , so please keep my review spoiler-free .|0
Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, 'The Golden Lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later, far superior work.|1
Homecoming ; what a HUGE disappointment ! ! After reading the plot summary ( the dead coming back to vote ) I expected a much better ending. This was a complete mess from the start! I will NOT read any other books by this writer or anyone else by this writer again. If I do it for a story I'll read another one, because this one was not worth the time and effort. I really don't think she has anything else to say and I won't be reading any more books by her or anyone else.|0
Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it 's beyond funny . The `` plot '' is about an American mercenary , who is hired to kill in Vietnam. When he arrives in Vietnam , he gets a taste of it . The mercenaries in Vietnam don't want the Americans to know about it, so as soon as the man arrives at his assigned target, they throw him into the fire . As the mercenaries are trying to kill him, the American mercenary kills several people and gets himself captured , but is then taken by the Vietnamese.|0
Have seen this movie today . Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist . The ending is a bit abrupt . One of the reasons why the ending is abrupt is because it is not clear how we got to this place and we didn't know who we had met before . If you can keep your minds and emotions together, then I am not sure how you can be disappointed by the ending of this film, but I am very sure that the film will be in the Best Picture list.|0
"I'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. Rather, I usually run out and see it (If I had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit A (So you can actually say something more than just ""McHale's Navy""). ""Mod Squad"" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking."|1
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination , like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights . There are several reasons why I did so , the first being that I’m not the least interested in science fiction . I like to read about what is happening today , not about the future. I like the action , not the plot. That’s the first reason why I gave this film a watch. There is a second reason why I did so , and that is that this film is not going to win any awards for any genre.|0
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their first daughter, who was killed by a car accident at age 18. They are haunted by a spirit that is determined to bring them to their knees. And in order to save the spirit, they must get to a man who knows where it is hidden. My Review: I’ll start this post by saying that I had my doubts about this book because I did not find the story interesting. I did find a lot of it creepy.|0
The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not ? I am watching a taped episode of one of my favorite shows. I cannot remember its name but you can google it, there are many shows on there. The thing is, I do not care that it is taped. I watch it on the computer and enjoy watching it. To be blunt, the show is good. But I do not love that I have a computer at my house. So I watch it on the DVD player, my laptop, my iPod.|0
"""The Dresser"" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the ""energetic"" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."|1
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long time friend and confidant.Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it.|1
Okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *SPOILER ALERT* The film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is so very.) Now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough.|1
One should not be too critical about the director 's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba . There is no doubt that Madiba made an impressive film, and that his character was the most memorable, but I still do not understand why the director was so late in releasing this version, especially as the film was finished in late 2008. Maybe he felt he could not release it until then.I have seen several reviews of Madiba that say the film version was a bit better. This is probably true. The film was shot in two weeks and Madiba came home with his wife and children in time for dinner.|0
I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen.|1
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother.|1
This film easily rivals the emotional strength , the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of `` 12 Angry Men. The film is set in the near future in America , and the main protagonist, Ray Bradbury , a writer for an advertising firm , who is forced to work hard and live by the way he has to live because the company has to move to Los Angeles. He then goes to a psychiatrist who is an alcoholic , then goes to another psychiatrist who is married . Then he gets a divorce . In the meanwhile , Ray Bradbury goes to the psychiatrist who is his ex-wife .|0
"This is primarily about love in WWII , yet we must remember that it 's also a biopic for Dylan's life, as well as the life of the American soldiers who are the subject of the film. The love stories of the soldiers will be portrayed in a way that does justice to their individual personalities and their relationship with each other, while at the same time it does justice to the men who have served. This will not have a ""deeper meaning"", the film will just tell you that Dylan wanted to love his own soldiers and the way he did it."|0
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity.|1
Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job.Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.|1
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize CN. OK. Doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit.|1
There 's nothing much to the story . A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where her parents work and heads out into the world to see the stars. Her quest for money and knowledge brings about an unexpected discovery: a whole new life. But with all that money, she has no time for family. So she leaves home. She goes to a strange place, the Amazon jungle, and becomes a porter for the natives, and then a farmer. Now, in her adopted home, she meets and falls in love with an Amazon king.|0
"Korea's answer to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary."|1
This show is terrible . I can not get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains . It is the same same same bullshit . This show sucks and it needs to be completely removed from the air and replaced with something better . The producer was the worst ever . I don't know how anyone can listen to what the producers are saying . I think they are so drunk at the bar that they couldn't even be heard . I'm not saying it on purpose it just so happens that this show sucks .|0
Move over Manos. Back off Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst film ever. The only horror in this thing is watching it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. If this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. It's dreck. No wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck.|1
"It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops ""Derailed"" and ""Second in command"" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film ""Until Death"" had no martial arts in it at all!! !That being said, this film is significantly inferior to ""Until Death"" which was a really good turn for Van Damme."|1
"Well...it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. The plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting oriented, but in ""The Shepard"", JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape."|1
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I’m sure you already know the name but if not, go back and read this review of the previous episode of the series: http://www.thesimpsons.net/tv-review.php?id=1331. It is the second half of the second season of the popular series. If you do not know, the series is about an elderly English gentleman who has inherited a large fortune from his forefathers. They had made a deal in the 19th century for a parcel of land in the United States called the land grant.|0
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids.|1
"Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word ""visionary"" in them. Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them."|1
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" or ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis."|1
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...Grand Champion. The story of a 12 year old boy (Buddy) that with the help of his sister, Mom and best friend is determined to raise a Grand Champion steer. It is a whimsical journey to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hokey....it would be on a bun!|1
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person. This movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. The dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. The chick of the movie is such a cliché.|1
"I think the ""Bone Snatcher"" should go after anyone associated with this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker."|1
With a title like that , you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter , Leonardo Da Vinci. However, it is not; instead, it's a love story. The story starts with a young, newly-wed couple going to the hospital to have their first child. The child is a boy. The couple goes into labour and things are a bit more complicated than we can understand, but as a result of their love story, their child will be named Leo. Leo is a beautiful, healthy boy, with an easy smile and a mind of his own.|0
"This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . It 's supposed to be a remake or a remake of another movie. I watched this movie over and over again and i finally gave up because the only way I could take it seriously is by not laughing. I would never laugh at something like that. I was like ""what the heck"" and I could just not laugh at it anymore because of how ridiculous it was. I ended up giving up watching it cause it was so depressing and i felt like crying all the way through."|0
2005 was one of the best year for movies . We had so many wonderful movies , like Batman Begins , 300 , The Social Network , Thor , The Hurt Locker and the latest Marvel movie Avengers: Infinity War . We also had one of the biggest movies ever the Avengers : Endgame. But I was not here last year , that would be 2018. I’m back here this year , for sure ! We had the release of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is the first time in my entire life , when I could see Avengers: Endgame. And it was awesome.|0
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of the style, but that's a bad sign of bad writing. At first it is just the sound effects, but at the very second it gets really bad, you start wondering if the story is written in a way where there is no sense in it. And it doesn't really make any sense either. It starts out with a bunch of characters meeting each other, and then the writing starts to play tricks.|0
"This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work depicts. Ward and Dalton aren't so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince. She was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward ""Why can't I move you?"""|1
There are actually some good reasons , why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching a film made for the purpose of making money. The first reason is , it will make the viewer’s brain tick. It will keep the viewer engaged, because the brain is stimulated by the action. The brain has a lot of things that it uses to work, and those things are enhanced by sensory stimulation. But if the brain gets distracted, then the brain is forced to shut down. Second reason why a person should go to such films is that he/she might get to learn something.|0
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh.|1
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently , it turned out to be exactly what it looked like when it was released in 2001. It was a movie I thought was terrible. There were so many things wrong about it. I didn't like it, and in the years since I have watched it so many times and still feel bad about it. It's a film I think should be re-released, but it is a film I still think is awful. So why do I continue to hate this movie and how can I get it to come back?|0
"... '' Flight of the Living Dead '' sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ``Mork'' Millstein, who has never shown any talent as a director. There is plenty here to enjoy, but I'm going to keep the review short because, really, I've had a long time in this movie, and it's not time for me to spoil all the fun.

'' Flight of the Living Dead '' begins with a car crashing into a house full of zombies and, while they are all eating dinner, a man appears and explains his predicament to them."|0
This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film.|1
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 , starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor , Avery Schreiber as Corporal Jody , Steve Cochrane as Sergeant Major Larkin , and Michael O'Shea as Sergeant Thor , this is the only film to date to feature the late Stephen Macht in his role of Thor. The film was produced by Richard Donner who was also in charge of directing this film. Other cast members of the film included Lenny Kaye , Jack Elam , Jerry Lewis , John D. Barry , William Hickey , Paul Frees , Dick Van Dyke , John Wayne , Bruce Dern , and John Carradine .|0

After an hour of intense fighting, and even after getting the worst of the fighting knocked out of them, the remaining members of the Shadowhunters still stand no chance to escape. This is the part that you’re all thinking, “Okay, how do we make this work?” Well, there is only one way to make this work, that we need you to do. It can be a very tall order, and it requires a lot of patience."|0
After having problems in Chicago , the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew , as a family of four in the 1950s. The farmhouse sits in the midst of a lush green valley, dotted with farmhouses, trees and farmland. The farm is now the site of a major oil company oil rig site, and the family moves in to make the most of this wealth and opportunity. However, something is not quite right with the house, and the family must struggle to keep its home and family safe from an evil that is trying to claim the family and take what they hold dear.|0
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year 's best family film. The humor comes through clearly and in the best way possible. All the children have smiles that go straight from their eyes to the screen. But not all children are as talented. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking the whole film must be a kid's movie, because if it wasn't then there's not much to it. The characters are all too real, and their emotions are so real it makes us cry.|0
I went to see this because I'd never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, since it doesn't offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. Her parents evidently don't care about her very much, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her.|1
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries , odds are you will find this one fascinating . Not only does it cover the human costs of wars around the world . But it also shows how governments have failed to provide the resources that they need , even if they claim to the contrary . So let’s take the most basic premise first: The United States continues to bomb Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, etc. etc. It has done so as an act of self defense . As a result , there are children being murdered .|0
It´s all my fault . They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the genre and there is too much sex and violence and it´s too graphic . But they are wrong, I love this movie . And it´s definitely not a sex film but I don´t know how to say this , but this is one of those films that was made when you were in high school in the 80s . It´s a movie for you if you want a really great film , if you have a passion for movies and movies from your favorite period .|0
"I loved this movie when I was a teenager . LOVED it . It has n't grown up with me . I would rather watch it again. I liked it when I was 16 or 17 . I was 13. D

That is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen and it is also one of the few I haven't seen yet. I would like to see it, though, because it's a must for me!"|0
Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do ! I was appalled . Do NOT take kids to see a film, even if it's FREE. You should be ashamed. Click to expand... I've made it a part of my life to take kids to see movies and I see this as a direct assault on freedom of expression and expression of all kinds. This is especially true when you consider that it's only free movies that can get me to the theater and that I have to buy my own popcorn.|0
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin. This is a low grade B feature that should have went straight to video. The violence is vicious and gory, but actually quite mild. The story line is so weak and dialogue so haphazard it is hard to work up much interest. Eileen Daly is the lead character Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth, and Isabel Brook.|1
This is a very enjoyable , fluffy , glamorous musical from the 40 's . 'Cover Girl ' made Rita Hayworth one of her biggest hits, and was a big seller on Broadway and in film and television as well. I had seen the movie when it first came out on VHS in '96, and then watched it on TV every single day for six weeks straight. I finally got around to watching it again in the late '00s. I saw the movie twice, and I was able to pick out a few details from the DVD copy, which I still own and have been keeping for many years .|0
Because that 's what Hell Ride pretty much is . Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein 's money. That 's what it 's all about, Larry. You know. It's not just 'cause they 've been buddies for a year, it 's because they were friends for thirty years and he 's trying to save the world and all the people in it. Hell Ride is one of those films where the acting is fantastic. The cinematography is superbly executed. The acting is great. But what really sticks out for me is the plot.|0
Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast, great lead performance. Worth watching.Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright.The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.|1
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals . One of the worst movie that I ever watch . The first two stories is a story of 3 men . One is the protagonist of the first story . Both of the guys are the bad guys and the protagonist of the story . The 3rd story is of 2 different people who meet and get involved in a very bad situation. They try to save each other but fail because of their inexperience . I will try to give you an example for each one of the stories so that you can understand how I understand them .|0
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a '1'?I thought ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything COULD be worse.I was wrong. ""Galaxina"" is that rare movie where EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented, ""Who the hell LIT this thing?"" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . ."|1
i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though.|1
"I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised how good of a movie this was. I know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. It maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the morality play was a good one. I liked the realism which was along the lines of ""Unforgiven"". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it."|1
"I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of ""High Octane"" cop shows such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series."|1
This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies.|1
"A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. Nicknamed ""Good Time Charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's Lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact."|1
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley).Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children.|1
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time . It 's dull , ponderous , badly acted and stupidly acted . And yet there is one major thing that makes this film so very unique and memorable . And that is it 's soundtrack. The film is a masterpiece , and you should listen to it all the time . The film is truly incredible . And here is the soundtrack . It's truly incredible . If you have never heard anything about this movie , I recommend listening to the soundtrack. And the soundtrack really makes this movie great .|0
The animal-eating ( geek ) scenes were not as bad as you would think . After having watched Mondo Cane in person a few weeks ago , I was very disappointed to hear that it was only coming to North America. However , it turns out the hype is not unfounded. It is coming to the UK in the summer of 2001, but only the US for now. I found out from an old friend who works there, that there will be a special edition released to the UK, Europe, Asia and Africa . He has confirmed this.|0
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing the action and dialogue was great and i thought the actors were outstanding, they brought life and wit to the script. I'm a huge fan and will be following the series for as long as i can because I think they are talented actors. I'm sure i would have liked to see them in a good movie but, for now i just enjoyed their performance. This is an excellent book and I'm glad you enjoyed the movie a lot.|0

One of the passengers of the car falls from the sky to his death. The car crashes to earth and is crushed by a building. It is the death of a young couple. As they search for their lost life partner, they encounter many strange things. The couple is unable to find him after several days. However, the man that was with the man and woman that was lost is in the house.|0
Forget any angst-ridden documentary ! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose new job is selling sex. In the film, she meets a man, who is also a film producer. They form an odd alliance and one night she has her first lesbian experience. She then meets an even more bizarre guy and their relationship is strained. It's not long after the sex that the film cuts to a sex scene that's far too explicit and explicit for some people ! But for most it's just something that goes through her head.|0
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on . The action scenes are some of the best you will find in a James Bond film. They don’t seem to end until they are all but over. This is because in real life the Marines aren’t in combat and there are a lot of things they don’t want out of this film. But when the movie ends everything has been done. There have been a lot of movies about the marines since the first Bond movie. So it’s worth to check this out.|0
I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot.|1
Beware, My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I did.A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside.|1
"Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made ""Bamako,"" but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.The nominal ""plot"" involves a young African singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. But far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as ""a mock trial against key financial institutions"" dealing ""with the overwhelming economic hardships of Africa."""|1
"This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.He also loves his mommy. So, to keep the money coming in, he takes his act to Broadway.SEE! CODY POWERS JARRETT BLOW HIMSELF UP ON HIS BIGGEST GAS CONTAINER YET! TONIGHT! 7.30PM! However, one day, his mommy dies and Jarrett goes berserk. He kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas cylinder.Losing control further, he makes them all scream ""MADE IT MA, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!"""|1
This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film.|1
"Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. ""Kay Hoog"" reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first ""Dark Knight""- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent."|1
"Two years after leaving the small town of Grover 's Bend due to encountering the Krites , Brad Brown returns to the place where he felt himself most at home. A place that has been empty for a long time, yet is filled with memories of his youth, and a life he never wanted. The place where he has found his love, one who he never thought would ever be his. Chapter One

Bend is a little town on a river. It has two sides, an older side and a younger side."|0
Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by Shag. The dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.).|1
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a film flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..This is a long film, but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love.|1
"I'm not a movie snob. I've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here--""Galaxina"" is just substandard. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. ""Galaxina"" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard. ""Galaxina"" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called ""The Blue Star""."|1
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap.|1
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the two unlikely stars of the late 1970s: an Irishman and a Jamaican woman. But, in the end, the plot is too silly to be funny. Lombard, who died in 2014, was born in Dublin in 1947 and moved to the UK when she was 15. She had two sons by her first marriage, whom she brought up to be polite, friendly and good-natured. She married the actor James Stewart in 1965, and he became her son-in-law.|0
To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES.|1
"If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on Cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you ARE on the Internet, after all).But whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH ""CHE!"". Unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.All the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave ""Che!"" their vote for worst film of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this travesty?"|1
"The Evil that Men Do ( 1984 ) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's and is the only film on the list that didn't actually have Cannon in it. It also marked a departure from the more ""Cannon influenced"" Cannon films. While it did a fairly good job on the material, the movie does have a few glaring flaws. For example, the film ends with an intermission and the end credits, and the end of the film has nothing to do with it. Also, the acting is a mixed bag."|0
"As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The ""creature feature"" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone? ), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying."|1
"I can't disagree with a previous comment that ""Driving Lessons"" is more than a little twee, but one man's indictment is another's endorsement, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself.I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress."|1
Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in New York. These are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. They exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is appears somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from ? How did they get there ? How do they cope ? Where will they end up ?|1
This movie was chosen , quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store . It is a great little flick . But for me it's too much of the same, with a very few exceptions. So, for my own sanity I had to look for a completely original film. And this one, as I mentioned before , is pretty much the only new film that I have seen. This is the first film I am familiar with that I had never seen before. So, if you are looking for a little something different , a film that I can recommend .|0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail.|1
Now here is a movie that does something that has n't been done in a long time . It take a whole movie to show the effects of a brain transplant on a person who has a brain tumor . It is hard to watch but I did . And that is what I have come to the conclusion that this is all about. I have never wanted to watch a movie like that . And it is one of those ones that make you think and ponder . And the thing is I am not sure of the storyline . It seems a little complicated .|0
It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull off Shakespeare's Othello, by bringing it to modern day context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. There were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending in Dessie's death.|1
"I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. It barely matters because the dire acting, clichéd camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-Shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. ""Get thee out of here!"" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain."|1
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an X-File. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up.|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters . Steven ( Andy Freeman ) is about to get married and wants his son to have his best party ever. To prove this, he gets his son Steven to have a birthday celebration where he drinks all the blood of every person he killed in his life. It’s just the most ridiculous birthday party anyone has ever had! Steven, however, thinks that everything is great and celebrates his birthday with his best friend Steve ( Simon Bird ).|0
"`` Graduation Day '' is a result of the success of `` Friday the 13th . '' Both of those films are about the horror genre films that were made at that time period. +

* [http://www.movies.yahoo.co.jp/navi/1708.html#the-Friday-the-13-th -] '' Graduation Day '' (1956) has been described as ''a mixture between the first and second instalment of the horror films of the early 1950s''. The movie was a critical and commercial success in Japan, and is considered to be ''among the top 20'' horror movies."|0
Now first let me say I love god awful movies . Especially horror films mainly . I watched hundreds of them . The best ones i can remember is The Descent , Insidious, The Others, I Am Legend, The Thing, It, It's a Good Life and The Conjuring . I even watched them all with my mom . I was never scared of any horror movies at all . The Conjuring made me not so much frightened of the scary things as scared of them . But as i said , i had so many of those movies at the time .|0
I watched this film not knowing anything about it . I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of the 80’s. It was actually a thriller that I liked , but this was not like a bad movie . The plot was great and the writing was great . This movie should be in the hall of fame of all time ! I was surprised at how well the story moved . I was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt overly dark . There was so much to like in this film. It was not an easy film to sit thru .|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie , because the trailer made it look so cool . But the fact that they didn’t have the budget to film it properly is a disappointment in itself . I didn’t like this film very much as a result . I did like the way it looked though . This was another movie I wanted to see for a long time . However , I thought that it would be a lot easier to see since it was just a trailer . And if they had made a feature-length film , then I would have loved the experience of seeing it with my family.|0
If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me!|1
I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?'|1
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. The movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. It had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.In short, I'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again.|1
This was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. Character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script? ), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?|1
As a fan of Henriksen ( I liked him in the `` Millennium '' series ) and of course Lorenzo, I didn´t realize that these two actors had such a deep relationship until I watched a short clip of the first film. They share a lot of scenes and the actors seem to communicate in an excellent way, so it was very enjoyable. The dialog was also very nice and the music was nice too. I´m not a huge fan of the dialogue in the first part, so it was nice to be reminded of it again.|0
The back of the DVD for this movie raves , `` Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films . In the movie, he's a preacher who wants to use the power of the church to get his daughter back for his son who left her, and he doesn't have her. He does, however, make sure that he has her back for his grandson that he's raising. And he does, sort of, have her. This movie is based on the book of Cheyenne by Robert Bly by the same name.|0
... a true geek-girl 's dream : high tech , high drama , smart guys , steamy sex , and lots of hot chicks . If you're looking for it , look no further , because it is found in the heartland , right here in the great state of Wisconsin . Wisconsin is a very friendly state with lots of outdoor activities to enjoy . When it comes to hot girls , theres not a place like this online . Wisconsin has lots of girlie girls that will take your fancy and you will be left wanting more .|0
"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, and anime all at once. The robots are actually called ""replicants"", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for ""heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal""....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films."|1
I ca n't believe some of the comments here in the reviews . The film is dated of course , it just does well as a piece of art. The cinematography was beautiful, the costumes and sets were very well crafted and well made. The story was very intriguing, the way the film is written and the manner in which it is handled by the director is also very innovative . The film is a very well crafted piece of entertainment . The special effects and special effects of this film are to be admired , it is certainly a film of its type .|0
"""De Dominee"" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But that doesn't really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! It lacks substance and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action!"|1
"I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, ""Ben Johnson?!"" - he was a goddam MOVIE STAR guys, a COWBOY, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for TV disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. So there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm."|1
my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of BAD IMPROV but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient.|1
Contains Major Spoilers, on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid.Predictable schlock from the start, and if that weren't enough, the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been. For example: will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dim as we go to a commercialand the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane!|1
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks , this film proved to be annoying in most aspects and I found myself unable to watch the entire thing before I had to go to bed. The film has the same plot and some of the characters look a little like characters from a kid’s movie. The film’s plot revolves around a boy who becomes obsessed with his mother and tries to figure out who her real killer is as he tries to avoid being drafted into the military. There’s some good stuff in this film; I liked the plot and it had some great performances.|0
There's a good story well hidden and never really used! The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. What is left is muddled and superficial.Turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.Watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.|1
"I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I would feel morally remiss if I didn't disagree.Now, I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, ""He Knew He Was Right"" was absolutely horrendous. ""Carrie's War,"" however, is probably the best I've seen so far."|1
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he 's a great actor ( Eternal Sunshine of the Spotty Kids is probably his best movie to date) . However he's an actor first & foremost, and is best known for comedy. He can also act in his own movies if they are made for the money. In this film I want to use humour as well as talent, and use it in an entertaining and humorous way. To me it's an odd combination of comedy & talent. I'm a huge fan of comedy first & foremost.|0
As a kid , this movie scared me green . As an adult , I could n't stop laughing.I have never laughed so hard in my life . This is an incredibly well put together film. It has the depth of a thriller and yet it is very easy to understand and laugh at it. It was a very well directed film. The performances were very good , especially the ones from both the leads. The music was fantastic and it made the whole film even better. It was very entertaining. The action scenes were extremely well shot and acted out.|0
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work.|1
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.|1
"A few yrs ago , I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell, whose films are still considered feminist by most women. Here she is:

I don’t want the title of a film to take on the weight and importance of “femininity”. But I want you to understand that there is no such thing. I’m a woman and you are a man and you are not a combination of both. So I think “femininity” is a very loaded term and should be treated with a modicum of delicateness."|0
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I work in the wine business, I had been quite eager to see this documentary, and I wasn't disappointed. Reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten hour series of the film on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing it). The bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long.|1
"The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys any and all things, the Bible claims to be true. To people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called ""blasphemy"", and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear, that many people think of it as a good sequel to the Bible. However, the film shows you a lot of things and subjects, that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the ""Revelation""."|1
"So , Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time , this time replacing the interesting characters of the original game, and with a few improvements to the story. The story is essentially the same, but a few changes are made, such as the inclusion of new weapons and characters. I will be posting a review of the game soon. First impressions

This time around, the remake is not bad, with an entertaining and very interesting storyline, and the new weapons, characters, and environment are very different than before. If you liked the original game, the new game is not so good."|0
Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? Did you not see that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The acting was fine, sure. But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. Things happen, but that's it.|1
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film. It is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake. Or, perhaps, their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart; looking for any reason at all to dislike them?The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action film, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself.|1
Another first : this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer . Perhaps I 'm a bit late , since he has already been around for many years, but I really wish to introduce Eric Rohmer , since I had never seen his work, and I 've never seen him speak (I 'm an English native ). I 'll try to write something more about Rohmer , so you can find more information about his work. So, let me introduce a little Eric Rohmer , I'm sure you'll be interested to see his works .|0
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club(this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans) I am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint. Afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves.The story is simple enough. In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. Luckily there's a few monkeys(chimpanzees) that have a bounty on their head that would get Boba Fett or Dog's(Duane Chapman) blood flowing.|1
"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? ""Who?"" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off."|1
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie . The way Michael Oliver who now is director was making the film was awful. But this was before the internet so there are people like me who watched it and liked it. I’m not sure if I would go again but the way the story was told was good. So I thought I would share with you this movie, which I found out about by seeing it in the theater. So I hope you enjoy. I didn’t see the ending because I had to wait for the credits to roll.|0
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great . I rated it 8 out of 10 . It shows that when it comes to movies, people still think about the same things as 40 years ago . The story is good , and I really enjoyed every scene in it . Some of the characters are very likable , and the plot is very well done . I really hope that it will have many future appearances on TV . I think that there is a huge gap between now and when it originally came out .|0
"Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a ""run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc"" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.There's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse."|1
"One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see, I guess he's fair game to criticize. And that's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a ""star"") Being gay and forty, I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover."|1
This is a snuff movie . I 'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library . But it does make some sense. It was not made as a spoof, it was made when the snuff movie was being discussed as a way to get into the IMDb to see if people wanted it. It was not meant to be in there , it was just there to see who would submit it to see if they could get it in. And the response from those that submitted was to see if it could be put there as a snuff movie .|0
Pilot Mitch MacAfee ( Jeff Morrow ) sees a UFO while test flying a plane -- but nothing shows up on the radar. But it's not just an aerial phenomenon: It's something from space. It's a big, round, metallic sphere the size of a football field that looks exactly like the one he saw, but it's not a real object. It's something in a UFO -- a test object. And it's not from another planet, either. Instead, it's a test for the Space X rocket.|0
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.|1
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. I suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can I say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (Omega Code, Left Behind).|1
"I 've never been a big Larry Clark fan , but somehow , I 've been dragged to almost every one of his films over the past few years . in fact , i 'm kind of shocked he doesn 't make a sequel . he doesn 't make any sense ! in fact , one of his films has been called "" the biggest disaster ever to hit american cinemas "" . and the only reason I can understand why Clark wants to make another movie is because he 's making money , he 's making money , and he needs to do another movie , because it is just too bad that he can 't ."|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies . The more bizarre and imaginative the film , the better! I also enjoy films from the horror genre where the acting is actually good. However I don’t think that a horror film should ever make me feel like I am watching a cartoon. I am looking for those films that will make me laugh and get me on the edge of my seat and make me actually feel scared. I don’t care what genre it is. If I know what it is I will find it and enjoy it.|0
"Put simply, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest.This film can't even pass the ""Soap Opera for Dummies"" test. I'm sorry I have not read this award-winning novel, so I am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went."|1
It's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a TV show.DORIS DAY decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why.|1
"Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there's ANOTHER murder...so it's someone in that room.What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before ""Dracula"") who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector."|1
"Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . The acting , directing and script are all so bad the film has nothing to recommend it. I mean what is there to be ashamed of ? The movie is awful. What a waste.”

“So what did I miss? Well I’m afraid I can’t point out anything in particular that didn’t live up to it’s hype. I can, however, offer this comment. This film is an abomination of horror that cannot be justified at all."|0
"I have always loved bad creations , rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college . Here’s a quote from my college film professor:

“Bad is not the word I use to refer to it, it means that the quality of what is being created is not always good. That’s it. It’s all a matter of preference. “If you can find a way to improve upon the film you are going to love you will have found the art form that you are seeking."|0
For me , this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles Film Center DVD, this time in 2D. If you’re not familiar with it, I recommend that you check out the Film Center site (link is in my bio), which has detailed descriptions of the films. The story of the film is a simple story of a young couple that’s in their 50s and who move from their hometown and move to a larger city. They have no children of their own, and have a couple of kids who are teenagers.|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy.|1
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired .. it wasn’t bad but definitely not memorable. The story isn’t really that interesting. There were so many subplots going on and I didn’t feel I was paying attention to most of them. The whole thing just seems to be a lot of back and forth between these two sides. The only really interesting element in the whole story is about these two guys who want the money from each other but neither one can get it.|0
This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead.|1
This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to . The trailer of this film is a mess, it looks like it's made of cardboard, the colours are dull, the animation looks bad . There's not much else to say about this film and I'm pretty sure it was a waste of time and money , especially when compared with the trailer. It doesn't even get any credit for being the best film of this year . What's your favourite film of 2016 so far? What's your favorite movie of 2016?|0
After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these.|1
Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX.|1
Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it.|1
The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie.|1
Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the mostly negative responses I've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy DVD release, I couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit.|1
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making . The pacing is poor , the budget must have been much higher that what its budget was for the most part , and the production value is not at the same level as other films of this genre. But, it does have a lot of fun action scenes that aren’t in other films of the genre and some decent character development. And the one thing I think it needs most in the way of improvement, would have been a bit more of a budget for the story.|0
It 's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy editing. But it’s certainly a work of art worth watching for its technical perfection. And you will, because that’s what you’ll remember when you’re older. The opening scene of The Sound of Music, a film in the tradition of the silent films, is a beautiful scene of snow. There is a bright sun in the background. The camera pans to the far edge of the frame. The camera is stilled for a while as the scene unfolds.|0
"this really is an ""okay"" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving it all..so here's the recipe to get a great show."|1
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. This is an oblivious labour of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full truly artistic elements. The movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by Mishima to him. All without being confusing in the least bit. The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won.|1
"My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60's... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre.The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of Le Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious ""American business"" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?"|1
Once again, I've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this one's not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile.|1
I love dissing this movie . My peers always try their best to defend it , probably out of love . Well this time , I did my very best to fight it and I succeeded. I’ll just post some highlights of my favorite scenes below . I have never really seen this movie before and after watching the first five minutes of it , I couldn’t understand what was going on. I guess I have to watch this one again and see how it is different and how is it going to change the way I feel about the movie.|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years . It is always different , but there's always something different about the way it's done . I'm not talking about the music score (which I have watched several times) , but the way it looks . Sometimes the colors are brighter , and sometimes they seem to go a bit dimmer . Sometimes there seems to be a lot of fog in the background , and on other occasions there is just a lot of bright lights shining . I have to admit it is an odd movie .|0
the actors can not act . all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character . Channing Tatum has never been bad in any of the roles . . . but she is not a very good actress. She really should go back to do what she had been doing before and become an actor. i think the problem lies with the producers. i was thinking that they were doing the best they could for her and the character . they should not have put that much time and energy into the project . i do not think that it will ever be accepted as the final movie.|0
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too . Her character is a very complicated and layered character with an interesting backstory that you will have to experience with this movie to fully understand. Lauren’s character and her mother are some of the better characters that I have personally had the pleasure of watching and experiencing with. Lauren Ambrose is one of the best actresses to work with, as an actress, director, screenwriter or just a woman that I feel like I want to spend time and get close to her.|0
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end.|1
I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 . Not only because of the psychological horror ( of which there is no end to) but for a more direct reason. It was the best film I'd seen for years, so I wanted to see a new one. That's what movies do, right? If you haven't seen it, take your chances with something that might be worth it. I've never regretted watching it again, because it was as good as I remembered and there were many wonderful scenes I forgot. But it did change the way I look at movies.|0
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome , 'Caligula ' is not made in the style of the best of historical dramas; the characters and the events do not carry any weight with the viewers. As a dramatic spectacle, it is rather like an episode of the TV series 'Lost In Space' : the plot has no substance to it at all and the story does not interest the audience either. This is also what makes 'Caligula ' so disappointing for those who enjoy such historical epics : it is not a historical story.|0
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett ( A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell ) Piper, with a bit of horror thrown in, and I love it. Brett has some awesome stop motion animation skills. He is really talented at this and makes this a great watch. I haven't really thought about this movie too much, but it would make a great Christmas gift idea. I can say, however, that it takes some time for things to get moving on the screen, and that means that you have to watch it a couple of times to see how it's done.|0
"I don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of ""Duck and cover"" or ""Protect and survive""!Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track 'Kinky Sex Makes The World Go Round', and you're pretty close to Whoops!"|1
Dictated by thin experience ( of both life and industry ) and no cash Sofia Coppola 's early short is now a short film, with the movie debuting at TIFF, on Thursday, November 1st. This is the first film by an actor to debut this early on a Canadian film fest, in addition to her last film The Bling Ring, but it’s not the first time we have seen Coppola work in a film. In 2009, she had her first feature length film, A Simple Plan, just after finishing up production on an untitled project she was originally attached to direct.|0
This movie was lacking in a lot of areas . It 's about this Elvis type guy who races cars and loves his girls . He gets into a car accident that kills the girl he was in love with . It then goes downhill after he gets back together with his girlfriend . The girl 's still in love with him so the story has a lot of plot holes . I thought it was pretty good because of the storyline . But it had a few weak parts . For example , the part when he is chasing the girl he really wants .|0
This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could watch and enjoy. The only problem I found with this film is that the plot was a bit clunky. This was my second movie that I have seen, so I had to try to learn the plot line before watching the movie because I had already seen it before. This movie could have been more exciting, and the story may have been more interesting if it had not been rushed in the middle of the movie.|0
This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Alice, a small town Massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami. After her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happen to be traveling to Florida..|1
"The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less ""recognizable"", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose ""bar"" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty."|1
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties.|1
"Ridiculous , nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ; ineptly , superficially , and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés of the modern novel in search of a story , but to no avail . This review is not a review of the original novel but a review of the book itself . The title comes from an article that was posted a while ago but the author and its author do not believe it was actually published . I think this title should have the following quotation :-

“It’s the doggerel, the rubbish, the rubbish-crap ."|0
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater.|1
"Well Folks, this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however, the additional downside includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline.It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediatly ""focuses"" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days) and his parents are coming to viusit him."|1
"Like another poster mentioned Ch . 56 ( a local Boston TV station ) showed this multiple times over the years but I don't think there is any way to see it, and also I have never watched much of his stuff. Maybe it was during his last years. Quote:

I was just wondering if there is a chance that he is on the record as to his whereabouts. I can't say for sure if I remember it or not, but I did find a couple places that show his name, but it seems that most of them were before his death."|0
"This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen. Probably ""Okul"" is the first turkish horror film. I must say that I were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. This shows that turkish film improves itself by time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, It was really successful."|1
River 's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual incident during the Second World War.The film tells the story of seven young people who lived on the outskirts of a small town in the USA during World War 2. They have been separated from their families and placed in the care of a local psychiatrist who was trying to restore order and sanity. He had no intention of letting these teenagers leave his home and he was doing everything possible to make the situation as comfortable as possible for them.|0
I posted on IMDb on this series recently , giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the company. A few people had written back, and then I decided to post it on my own website, at the end of the first series. Well, that didn't last too long, but I hope you can find this on the net somewhere if you want to see a full review and comment. This time I have no intention of rehashing the story, it is a well know tale and has been thoroughly covered by most sources.|0
Even though this film 's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character , I might not agree with that, since the role was not one that would have been very popular back in the '40's and '50's. Of the many films about Sally Hemmings in that time, this is the only one where her character doesn't seem all that important. However, I think it's an interesting and thought provoking piece of art. I really like that this film is set in the present day and that she is still trying to make contact with people who can help her.|0
This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, Tobias Wolff.Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, I won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself.|1
"Well every scene so perfectly presented . Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every word . My favorite scene :

The scene when the mother and her son arrive at the house of the man she loves. She brings a gift for him from her son . She gives it to her son and he opens the door and goes inside . The man sees her and she says,

"" I love you son, I just want to hug you. I have so much I want to show you"" . And then he embraces her ."|0
"So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the ""Carnosaur"" trilogy, ""Pterodactyl,"" ""Raptor Island."" Then I flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie SciFi placed in its glamorous, Saturday prime-time slot. Some movie I had never heard of before called ""Raptor."" I was pretty excited. The movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a Velociraptor."|1
I was n't sure where this was headed until the ending . when it turned out that this was all a set up to be killed off later . well you're welcome to take it, as I'm enjoying it. and thanks for the comment . I'll leave it to you, as I'm not sure where this will go in a few months and I want to have more of it finished. . at least now i know i have more ideas for it , so i may go back and work on a little more stuff . and that's it for now .|0
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie . However , not more than 5 minutes later , I realized that I was still sitting there with the movie playing over in my head . At this point I was hooked and have watched the entire film at least 20 times , and even more times with the soundtrack playing. The acting and chemistry between the actors was perfect and it is clear from the trailers and interviews that this is going to be a movie that will make you want to be a character you can relate to.|0
It 's complete nonsense . I 've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the `` parallels . I know there are similarities . But it is all nonsense . Hitler 's ideas are different . I can not see how anyone can compare Nazism to Christianity . Its the same as communism or any other belief system . The Church is the Church . They are the Church - it is the Church I can tell the difference between them . The Church is a religion - it is a belief system and not a religion .|0
What a mess -- and I 'm not referring to the `` destruction '' in the title . I could be talking of a nuclear-weapons attack . Or of a terrorist action , or of some other event that might have the same effect . These are all possible ways of ending the war in the Middle East . If you add it all together , what do we really have . It's almost impossible to say what will happen . Now , I am not saying that the conflict in the middle east can't be won . There are many things that can be achieved by diplomacy .|0
As I read the script on-line , I thought `` Capote '' needed a trim . Having just seen it in the movie , I know this is true . I also read his novel in a bookstore , but did not have a chance to get a copy of the movie . Maybe I will find the time later . Maybe not . I guess you get my drift . I just watched the movie . I have to say that it was not the movie that I was expecting . There is a story to the movie but it is a very poor movie .|0
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming . Boy , was I ever disappointed. I would have preferred to be in that movie , and if that movie had been shot this year I think I might be a little more impressed. I would also have liked to see the same kind of special effects that are used in Avatar. I know I saw some of them , and I am sure they would have been cool, but I think Avatar has the edge on that because they had a better budget, a better team, and it was much cheaper to film it.|0
"In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was ""Just a Nightmare"" and it was very well written!! and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks."|1
"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then ""Prosper Merimee's"" well-known story about ""Carmen."" I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes."|1
"Hearkening back to those ""Good Old Days"" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole Season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. (We can't recall just whose it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former ""Little Tramp' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds of his being an ""undesirable Alien""."|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). Young Billy, Elizabeth, and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. But they can't go on fooling everyone.|1
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this ... well , bizarre film . Canada becomes part of the United Kingdom when it's time for the royal wedding. And there's much, much more . . . like a lot more. I was lucky to have an insider to give me a heads up that this film was coming . And now I have to say , I didn't know it would be so bizarre . And now it's been announced that the movie is going to come out August 28th, 2010 . This is going to be an odd time of year.|0
This is only the fourth effort I’ve watched from this director (whom I met and found quite genial at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – I’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone!|1
"In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited ""peekaboo"" hairstyle. She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring screen successes in films like ""This Gun For Hire"" and ""I Married A Witch"". She held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in ""So Proudly We Hail"". But changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over."|1
ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability.|1
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . The film is made up of short scenes and lots of dance numbers . It’s pretty funny and has great choreo. It also looks quite good in the cinematography . The story of the film starts with a couple of children who have some kind of talent . There’s always some sort of competition going on in these type of competitions. There’s always some sort of challenge. It’s kind of interesting .|0
"The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of ""Drake & Josh"" fame, personally I'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier) and the ""Rick Punchers"" joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom."|1
I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really weren't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality.|1
The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love.|1
"The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry ""Rain"" Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time."|1
I really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But, sadly, it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived.|1
Im warning you people out there , this is just a waste of your time . I am being honest . It's just not worth it , even if you have some sort of interest or affinity for these kind of things. You are going to lose people that care about these kind of things and it doesn't help to be told by a person with your interests that they're stupid , ignorant , uneducated and are probably in the pay of Satan . Even if you did have some sort of interest in this kind of thing and didn't have an axe to grind you'd be dead wrong in all ways.|0
Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. I'd suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do. Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money.|1
"Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows.Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining. ""The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog."|1
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great I forgive him.Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done.|1
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. I realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. Beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart rack...You know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget.|1
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy.|1
I saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it.Look, I can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. But this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. Oh well, they say love is blind...The neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too.|1
The only reason I checked this film out was to see the `` early '' Kim Bassinger . That , to my mind , is a bad idea , because the story doesn 't work . The way the film works , I didn 't see any `` early '' , and I don 't know if I'm missing something or it just wasn 't `` good ''. The story is kind of slow . It makes little sense , there isn 't any sense of story progression , there 's only so much you can get in one film . There 's not much suspense .|0
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing crud! Incidentally, the bit about Canada joining the US didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President(but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that).|1
This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock.|1
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song.|1
Of all the movies in the history of movies I ca n't imagine someone sitting down and saying , I am really going to go and see it this time. I don't think I could handle that feeling. I think I would freak out for a few days. For those of you asking what the title of the film is: I had the idea for a short film on the title of the film I wanted to make. But I could not come up with a good title until I had made the actual film.|0
This formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tightened.|1
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.)|1
In my opinion the directing , editing , lighting , and acting ( minus Franco ) were very good . But in my opinion, the music and the story were so bad it was a shame to even include it. I would give this a 4 but it's a low point. I would of loved to have seen more depth in the film but it just didn't make sense to be so bad . If you like this film , it's worth the watch but don't bother with it, you will be glad to find out why it sucks .|0
Arnold fans will holler in joy , fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment , and Catholics will just sit there and do nothing . That is the way it goes in America and in England . It doesn’t matter how good or bad you think your team is going to be, when you get out of bed you have to go through the motions of putting on the same old outfit, the same old outfit, the same old outfit, the same old outfit . When you’re out of your bed you go to the same routine every day .|0
"If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart , then you probably know about the $ 5 DVD bin that sits next to the drive-in. In fact, some might even think that this is something that Wal-Mart would offer to Wal-Mart customers in the United States for free. But what is the $ 5 DVD bin? Is it some kind of special promotion for Wal-Mart or just a DVD bin for other types of movies? Here’s what we do know. The $ 5 DVD Bin

First of all, what is a $ 5 DVD bin?"|0
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War . The largest front of the whole war took place between the German and the Soviet armies. This is why we need to start telling the story of our country and its people, that is, the Second World War. The Second World War is still a mystery today, but if you are a person who lives in Russia, then you have an opportunity to learn a bit of the history of that war that will help in your everyday life. I will start the story of the Second World War in the first chapter.|0
I was duped as well . Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you think happened to me. The thing is, I had seen a guy just the same way before. The thing I was looking for in my dream was that the guy I was seeing could see me from a long way up. In reality I was looking up at him from all around . I was so shocked and confused that I couldn't move or think straight. I didn't even know I was paralyzed. I was just frozen and not able to move anymore.|0
"""The Journey"" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), ""The Journey"" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home."|1
It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.|1
Great acting , great production values , good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the main storyline but then you get bogged down, and you can't get past the end credits sequence . The acting was good but some of the parts were hammy .I just wasn't into the movie , but I do think it would have been good had he made more of it and it is worth seeing just to see what he can do with the material , if you have seen other movies with him , then you'll understand why I wasn't into him .|0
Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and Catholics will just holler.Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn.|1
This is one odd film . It seems to be aimed at a younger audience , but is filled with violence, language , profanity and sexual images . Even in its early stages , I was shocked that a director would be able to take two teenagers on a quest to uncover the origins of their family, only to find that they are not the only ones involved in that family . We are sent into this world with no knowledge of the history we are supposed to be uncovering , but with only our imaginations as guides.|0
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January (2005) I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so unlike her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.|1
"A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on ""Dante's Inferno,"" there is nothing especially clever. Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art.I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked."|1
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is ! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that doesn't feel real is what I was expecting from the first third of the film and I wasn't even expecting to be a little dissapointed by the end. When you've got to take a shot in the dark, you've got to take it for what it is and what it stands for rather than what it did, and that doesn't happen here. This is the kind of story that makes you forget about all the things you know that this movie has been trying to tell you.|0
Ah ! When good actors take on bland material ! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight thriller, think twice. Its an adventure story of a beautiful girl, who is being blackmailed by the devil. Her parents were killed in a brutal murder and the father is locked up in jail for his crime. Then he comes to her rescue. She becomes the victim of a vicious plot of Satan. And he also wants her to be his queen, even if that means he can't keep his distance from her .|0
A young couple decides to runaway to sunny California. They never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the Rest Stop.After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. When she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you may ask?|1
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says ""stay away from this movie"". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the worst movie I've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast-forward button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, ""The Cavern"" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like ""The Cave"" and ""The Descent""."|1
This movie is simply bad . First of all the story is just weird and it 's not good written or made. And second, I don't even know if it's true, but I think you can check it for sure . In my opinion this movie has no plot at all . I think the plot of this film is too confusing to understand at all . At the end you might feel a little bit confused . I do not watch horror movies anymore but this one, I think this movie is a good Horror movie but I don't know how good the story is .|0
`` Go Fish '' garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then that I realised the greatness of the cast and the talent that has made this a unique experience. I will not spoil anything, except to say - I am looking forward to every moment with this movie. From the moment I first saw the film I knew right away I had to have it, and this is only the beginning of my love for the movie. I am glad to have this opportunity to review a movie I really love.|0
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (A real acting stretch...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sells!) however when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) ""Battle of the tough guys"" who's champion Zeus (Played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital."|1
This thing, directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. I hope Troma or someone would distribute this film in the States, so that you guys out there can excperience the French stench at it's worst.|1
"What? - that was it? The town sheriff (John Agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? With instrumentals by The Wildcats, ""Night Fright"" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. Remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb."|1
I 've lost count of the times I have seen this movie , but I love it and find it absolutely brilliant. It has the right mix of suspense , horror , comedy , and it has a heart of gold and it has just enough heart to make you cry. It has some great scenes and it is worth the time to watch all 4 episodes if you haven't. If I could, I would give this movie 5 stars out 5 and tell you how great it is, but it won't be easy, trust me, there are some people that will not like this movie.|0
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series , and had just watched parts 1-3 , which I think was great to start. But there was something wrong with me. I’ve watched the first 4 movies , the entire series, and thought the movie had been done well , and the story and characters were great. Then I watched part 5 and then went to watch parts 6-8 and I’m not really a fan of those movies or the characters . I mean I liked the first 3 movies and thought they had just the right amount of horror , but after that the whole movie got boring .|0
What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role.|1
There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.Here's what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer.|1
Right up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Too bad too, because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot.|1
"I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came on A&E some years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actresses. This has got to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. The storyline of this TV version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! The ""kicker"" (pun intended) comes when Ruth has surgery done on her leg bones."|1
"LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean ""Tom Cruise"". Maverick means ""non-conformist"". ), is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport, Florida."|1
Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture.|1
I was attracted to this film by its offbeat , low-key , 'real life ' story line . That is all it was . I did a quick check of Wikipedia about the plot line of the film where it says , The movie is a mystery . But as you may have guessed , the movie makes sense in a lot of points . So I must be in the wrong movie . But here it goes . The movie begins with a young journalist, played by Aishwarya, being brutally murdered by the criminals on the street .|0
Well , I 've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it 's still almost as interesting as it was when I was a child. In my opinion the main reason to rewatch it is that if you didn 't see it, you can always rewatch the original version. You can also see all the little clips and special features that were added, as they are available on the DVD. However, the point I would like to bring to everyone 's attention today is that I do not own a VHS tape or DVD player.|0
"This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland , who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades in the business. She returned to play the role of her mother in the 1991 film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's story, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1991) . She was replaced in the lead role by Dolly Levi , who had appeared as a child in the film's pre-release publicity. In May 2009, Irish, who was 83, made a surprise visit to a New York hospital where she underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer

In January 2012, she appeared on NBC's Last Man Standing."|0
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other and you’ll get my reaction. No seriously, you’ll want to go have your own mind blown by the fact it’s happening, I mean, just look at her in that outfit, not to mention her face! What I’m getting at here is that, even if we all agreed that this remake of the original was the best of the series, I just can’t agree with the rest of the world. Why?|0
This movie baffled me. I could not get a grip on it. Thought I might be missing something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This isn't always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so I will...They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I don't get it??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL!|1
Never mind the serious logic gaps , never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals , never mind the haphazard writing and plotting , there were some fine moments ( I am talking here of course , not about the film ) to be had. But all in all , I would not say that I felt the film would be greatly improved by the addition of the sequel. One of my favourite movies of this year , and one which I will not hesitate to watch again next year or the one after ! As for the cast , it was not bad really but not great .|0
"I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, ""What's so funny?!!"". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it."|1
"This is my first ""awful"" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator. ""Hell Ride"", directed, written by and starring Larry ""Friend of QT"" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged."|1
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love . In fact , it makes sex look silly and pathetic , for me that’s a big reason for not liking it . There is just nothing to see in this movie . The only good thing is that you’ll have a good time watching it with your friends . The story itself is a little predictable , but I guess you have to like that , right ? 😀 Well , I didn’t 😦 😦 😦 It’s not the end of the story . There’s still more .|0
"I ca n't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10 ? It really is great , very funny and not too much to the point. The only thing I wouldnt like it if it was longer

I was watching this movie and thought it had the potential to be an award winning film. I didn't know it had been released yet. There were a few times I didn't even bother to watch it, and I was pretty impressed when I did. It's very good! I really liked this film."|0
This movie does n't have any pretense at being great art , which is good . But it is a great piece of entertainment , because of a few things . This movie is based in a fictional world , so that it is believable . The characters have a great chemistry between them , which makes it easy to believe in all of them . But , there could be a lot of problems , because the movie doesn't do anything really well . I found it hard to take it seriously . But , I will admit , it is entertaining , because the characters are interesting .|0
The main problems of 'Saw ' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will justly point out. In my opinion, those errors are the consequence of an author who wanted to make a joke on his readers. I won't rehash all the mistakes I spotted, since the errors are all pretty well known, and they are usually explained in the comments. But there are two things I have found of interest, and I would be pleased if any of my readers could point out one or two mistakes in the film that are not covered in the comments.|0
"Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like ""The Avengers"" and the remake of ""Diabolique"" has directed this ripoff of the Die Hard concept, done on - what looks like - a Blair Witch budget. A California nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't Arab; they're really disgruntled American soldiers masquerading as Arabs! We find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. We're not sure what the statement is but never mind."|1
I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don't know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't.|1
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the French ruling Spain. The movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So, the movie gets confusing then. The movie begins when Ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judiasm by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put to the Question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison.|1
This movie was made on a relatively small budget ( 10-20 million dollars ? ) with almost no promotion at all. I think everyone involved knew the film had potential but chose not to go to the lengths of promoting and marketing it. The only reason anyone would come out and say they loved the film would be because they knew someone was going to watch it, right? Wrong! I watched the entire film on Youtube and was blown away by its quality, the acting, the acting from all of the supporting actors. It’s not a bad film.|0
This is a magnificent , and in many ways impressive film . I saw it on TV as a little kid , and it took me ages to really see the beauty of its filmic presentation . The film was also in English with no dubbing , which is a pity , but it really works in the film . The music is awesome . The story is interesting and the film is interesting . And the casting is good . What made the film great for me, and which I found particularly interesting, was not the story itself , and which was not the music, but its editing .|0

eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality , wherein characters run from realm to realm , landscape to landscape in search of answers to their real-time quests. The player is able to control the game world by turning and scaling the environment. The gameplay is similar to many other first-person shooters in the genre, which makes it enjoyable to play but may be considered a niche game. Rez is a platform game. The game was developed on the platform Xbox One, and the game was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Windows 8, and Linux on Steam.|0
"""Carlito's Angels"" is a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (I think ""fast-motion"" stopped being funny around 1914). The assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! The girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination."|1
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this . I am not trying to give anything away and all I am doing is giving my opinion as I am in love with the film. If anyone knows more than I am sure I have seen this movie before then please tell me your experience. The plot is pretty good . A young man goes to a creepy house and then ends up being in trouble . The house is creepy, creepy, creepy and it has a killer at it. The way they kill is good as well .|0
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful ! ! , as it 's one of the few times i've actually watched a movie where it felt like the story actually happened. I was actually really excited for it to begin as this is the first movie i have actually ever seen where i felt like i was actually there. For those curious, the first thing that happened after i watched the movie was when i was in the shower after i did my own thing and my friend was trying to wake me up.|0
That is what this movie is . Good God the special effects suck in this movie . It is difficult to tell what is going on on screen with this movie . If you like the story then the story might be good . If you don't like the story then maybe you are better off to go to see a film that might have better effects . The special effects in the film just sucks. The only good thing is that this movie might not have much action but that's not saying much. The story is alright but the special effects are the reason this movie sucked.|0
"I feel terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by ""playing"" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! She only sings one song - the title role of an Lehar-operetta, that is really funny!"|1
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it."|1
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah ) , each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key, noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. Aided by her , anything but enthusiastic, male friend, the two of them reach the end of their quest , but with a price to be paid.|1
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two, only to be disappointed by the quality. I know, I'm a sucker! And so it was that, in the wee morning hours, as I sat in front of my television set, I couldn't get through a second episode without a laugh. It didn't help that there were four episodes in the series. I was just glad to hear I wasn't going to have to wait that long to see the rest.|0
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash. The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly.Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it. First off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot. It cranks everything up and just goes. Next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat.|1
This is an excellent , little known movie . Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie , I can’t deny it . The whole film was great , as expected . However I felt a bit disloyal to some of the actors that did not get all of the screen time . I don’t know how others felt , I really didn’t . It was a great experience . There was an excellent cast in this film , but the only two who really made it are Tom Selleck and John C. McGinley , who has an amazing performance .|0
"That is the answer . The question is : What is the single reason to watch this movie ? I am going to tell you my personal reasons and not a summary. The story is very very good. There are so many good things in this movie. The acting is very good as well. There are so many great things in it that I can't even remember all of it. So I will tell you all about it. First , the plot

There's a very good story in this movie. I don't really know why I am doing this."|0
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. It’s fun. It’s interesting. It’s cool. And I’d really like to read the script because, you know, I just don’t like it. You know, I love the book. But the movie, it just doesn’t grab me. Do you have to read it? No. No I don’t have to read it. I could read it and I would like to, but I don’t think I need to.|0
"I loved so much last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece ""L'Ora di Religione"". It had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say Castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!)."|1
This is an excellent, little known movie. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I'd love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players.|1
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt so bad for the villain or the hero when it came to killing the person who has given you this gift. The story is great, the music is amazing, and the acting is just plain bad. I can’t stand when it’s so obvious to everyone that something terrible is going to happen, and I’ve seen all of those movies where they end up shooting each other off and then the hero gets shot too, which is what happens to me and some other people.|0
"I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people , not helped by a poor sound quality. ""We're going to send a letter to you,"" says a guy who appears to be in his 30s. I ask what his intentions are. He tells me he's a film producer. We talk some more. It turns out he's working with his friend at Bend. A friend of his at Bend is trying to create an app for the festival that will allow fans to vote for what they want to see."|0
I normally don't like romantic films, but I love this film very much. The story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel I really care for many characters in this film. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott until the ending scene. I want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the ending.|1
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the film.I think that if you hadn't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling)...).|1
Its my favourite film because there 's so much going on that you do n't see at first and so much that you get excited about. I love the characters, the plot, the way it ties into all the other things. This is just a wonderful film and it is so much fun to listen to the soundtrack and it's great to see it on the big screen too. I have no problems with the soundtrack. I love a great soundtrack. I don't listen to my music for a while before I go out and get the soundtrack.|0
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. My aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.I also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.This film clearly falls into the garbage category.The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director.|1
This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear?|1
"This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot. ""The French Line"", however, fails at all of these aspects.It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material."|1
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England . It is a tale of sex , love and murder with the stars of the 1960s and 1970s in it . Some of the action is set in the present day but there are plenty of references to the 1970s and 1980s so it makes for good comedy. The characters are the main focus in this comic strip as they try to navigate between their past and present but they also have a life outside of the comic strip as they struggle to cope with some very modern problems .|0
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. The movie opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed.|1
Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier. It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime, and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian.|1
Take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights in their hair. Why do that to your camera and then turn on your camcorders to shoot them? The answer is easy: You have a camera phone. And that is what they are. And when your phone goes off to record a video, you don’t have to worry about what it takes to keep the camera in good working order or how to keep it from freezing up during a freeze/thaw transition.|0
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp movies. So naturally, I'm surprised when I read this line from the title sequence. Why? Well, one thing that makes me curious is the title of the first episode. In my research, it seems that it might have been named ""Thirteen Days"" or something of that nature. I think it is pretty obvious what the name is trying to tell us about the story. But in any case, it's not surprising that the title was not originally chosen."|0
I thought this series was going to be another fun , action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. But I was wrong, it turns out the story isn't all that dynamic, at least in the first episodes, as I can't tell you much of what happens in episodes 2-4, but it is the second half of the series that has some very good story telling and plot. The series started with a very strong concept that I have never seen before, a group of aliens, who can control people with their mind's ability.|0
I 've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now . When a writer develops a story that they want to be published, whether it be in the form of short stories, novels, or collections, they often look for the right publication to handle the distribution and handling of those materials for them . In my writing, I try to be a true believer in the freedom of the publishing industry so when I find that I have a story I really want to be published and that it has a chance to be published by a publication, I want it to get as much attention as it can .|0
The story line of a man 's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the verge of losing. A father, a mother, an older brother and the father-in-law. The movie follows the lives of three people who were in their twenties when they realised their daughter could be their daughter. One of them falls for the father, who is married. And the other two have had their own lives in which they don't need anyone else. They are two people who love their children and have to come to terms with them.|0
If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands , the world would be in grave danger . This movie was made for kids to enjoy and is the only one I have seen that deals with the human rights. I’m not sure I would even watch the first two minutes or so since I’m afraid I may not get the message or the relevance of what is being shown. However, if you do watch the entire movie you’ll probably see the human rights in it, and not just in a few scenes.|0
You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting , but it 's far from it. The series revolves around the teen characters' (mostly teenage) adventures with the powers that came with them and how they deal with those powers. It's pretty much the opposite of the TV shows Teen Titans and Teen Titans GO! The premise of the series is that the teens get to experience all sorts of powers, but that it's not as big of a surprise as you might think. However, this isn't the case when you realize how much those powers do to a person.|0
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete garbage. This film starts off by showing a scene from the early stages of human evolution. A group of primitive humans come into a cave looking for food and are attacked by the animals. After being bitten by a snake they try to run away but are chased into the cave. The animals come after them but don't take any prisoners. While the humans flee into the cave they are followed by the animals who catch the escapees.|0
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film . Its hit man theme is very dry and is kind of a copout. The cast of the film are all quite average. The film is not very interesting. It doesn’t make any real statement and has a very small budget so is not that exciting. The only good things I can say for the film are that the actors are well cast, good performances, and that the film is in the form of a no frills cop film. If you can find it for under $30 you should be able to pick it up.|0
"*****Spoiler or two, not that is matters******Two things stand out about this movie. First is it's been titled both ""Bruno"" and ""The Dress Code,"" and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.Second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. The adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in."|1
I was amazed at the quality of this film , particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - and I say that as someone who has worked with her. It's not just her directing abilities, but a whole lot of skill that goes into the production and production design that make the movie so good. I also love the acting and the way she goes from child actor to seasoned professional within the film. The only issue that I had was with the ending, but that's probably more a fault on the writer's part.|0
"One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and Judgement Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.Actually, good candidates for a real Third Testament have been published several times - like ""A Course in Miracles"" or ""Conversations with God""."|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky.|1
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. It wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. Case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call.|1
Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident `` The Wind and the Lion '' is a very good book by a true author. I think it is very true. I think the events of the book have the real story. You know what they did. You feel what they did. You see what they saw. I think if you took out the bad parts and put in real good parts of what they did in the book the book would come out very well. I think the book is very interesting.|0
I love pop culture, but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this. Then, I seen an episode, and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best one they've had. He fits the character so well. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson.I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks.|1
"When I first heard about ""Greek,"" I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of ABC Family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a TV screen."|1
"This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid-80's I taped this movie (when VCR's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, he looks wonderful and has no affecting ""acting-isms"" (see ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" to know what I mean about that!!). I measure all his performances against this one. He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends."|1
Dear reader, Watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. If you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. However, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an American audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons.|1
I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there's also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert!|1
"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory."|1
"After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his ""Masterpiece"" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.So I have at least these five questions in my mind:1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Stéphanois. He couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car."|1
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan , but what happens when they start to trade their horses for human goods? In a recent interview with BBC News , Mr. Crawfurds explains his trade policy in the hopes that it could one day be extended to other horse farms around the world. The video is part of an effort to make the case that horses don’t have to trade to feed themselves and that we can support them instead. I don’t have to tell you that horses can’t eat, in fact they are incredibly delicious.|0
I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve, and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. The extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is.|1
`` Wagons East '' is widely known as John Candy 's last movie , as he died on the set of the second movie, The Wedding Singer, at the end of October . The movie is a sequel to his 1971 comedy, Candy's Way , about a family of gay couples . It was his first movie as a big-name star , as well as the first film that featured his son , John Lasseter . The Wedding Singer , which is also a sequel , has grossed $4.5 million worldwide . It is the most successful sequel in Candy 's film franchise .|0
Hello again , I have been thinking about this movie all my life . I saw it when I was a kid in the theater as a child . It was a big movie with a big story . I saw it about 3 years ago when I was going to a friend house . The story was very well done . It was also one of those films where you wanted to know how everything worked out . I went back to the theater one time when I was around 10 years old to see it again . I remember that movie so very well .|0
In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950 's . Leon , the leader of the gang , is about to start a war with the cops , who are trying to take him down because he is seen to be a gangster in the neighborhood . They decide to rob a safe house . It is being guarded by the police . The safe house is owned by a middle-aged man , played by a young man , played by . The man is played by , a very young man at that , he was about 18 and he is about 25 and they both act a lot like real teenagers .|0
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through , but how well can you drive through one and not break it? The plot has a lot going for it , and it's not the only plot it's the only one I could think of, there's something for everyone here, especially for the fanboy/nerd looking at it. So enjoy the ride and let us know of anything else you think could be good. And don't forget to give us your comments on our blog. I was looking around for an idea for a story idea today and I found one.|0
"I would like to know if `` The Outsiders '' ( Australian TV series ) will ever be released on DVD. I saw the trailer and was interested in it. The only thing I did not get a chance to get to know was, I don't like the direction this movie is heading. I also did not like the concept. What is your take on it? Thank you

I would have liked it to be a bit bigger. There wasn't a lot of stuff going on here. I don't think we've gotten the best of the movie yet."|0
* * SPOILERS * * I rented `` Tesis '' ( or `` Thesis '' in English ) on the internet. I was very scared to rent a copy since I had heard of it before. I finally decided to read it on my own. The whole story revolves around a young couple, who have an affair with each other and leave their home in an attempt to escape. After much time and efforts, they are finally able to escape to Greece and live their life happily once again. I liked the storyline quite well as the characters are all well developed and there is enough action to keep you interested.|0
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes , who once displayed a light , sardonic touch with beguiling material such as `` Whistle Down the Wind , `` has now turned his attention to films with a more serious theme. And, in his words, he's trying to ""bring back that old-fashioned sense of the movie-making process where a story can really be done right."" Not surprisingly, he's trying to do that here. But before he does, we should take a moment to thank Forbes, one of America's most respected film makers for many years."|0
Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen 's everyday 's life ? Is it possible to intrude upon their private lives without violating their rights? What are the repercussions of violating people's freedom ? What if the person is elderly or handicapped or a minority group? Is it not better to be careful? The right to privacy is a basic human right. People should be treated as individuals in society, not as members of a class. People should not be denied their basic constitutional rights simply for being born in the wrong family or neighborhood.|0
When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. He is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and American dream-working class hero trash (which I'm not). I don't get it. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on!|1
I 'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie : # 1 Angelina Jolie sex scenes are not only the hottest ever in Hollywood ; # 2 This movie is the highest rated ever on IMDb ; # 3 Even though a few scenes in the movie are just a bunch of sex scenes, Jolie did give a lot of good performances , including one of the most realistic body double we've ever seen, and we love it when women do the same. I also would like to add that we are really hoping that Jolie gets a part in the next James Bond movie after this one.|0
Before I start to tear apart this movie , mark you -- I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL . That story alone is enough for me to be completely in awe of the director . The movie has its own special place in my heart . It's a great piece of filmmaking and I can't wait for the Blu-ray and DVD versions . Here's a look at an exclusive look at Scarlet. It is being released as the first ever Blu-ray release to feature Scarlet as the main character. It will hit retailers on October 15, 2010.|0
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended, I was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.It's not bad in an entertaining way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors.|1
"Just a few words : it 's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he is not, then he really is not. I have been following the story of the 'Rome 2' and have been saying for years that ""it 's a great movie, but it is not that great of an improvement"" but now I believe it is true... This game has a great story, with great characterizations, great characters, great writing and great voice acting, but it just happens to be an even better action-adventure game that is just as bad as all the bad that comes with."|0
For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result  Petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).Overall, The Mad Monster is one dull and poorly made Poverty Row thriller.|1
"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film."|1
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. It unintentionally shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy OR the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience.|1
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true.|1
I loved this show . I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show . There was something so refreshing about the idea of an ice cream maker and I loved the ice cream flavor in this show. I'm an ice cream addict and I've only tried rocky road for about three months now. I've made a few different flavors. And I like all the flavors but I think the best one I've tried was the chocolate mint flavor. I'll post pictures of my flavors soon. It's so good!|0
This is another of Robert Altman 's underrated films ( let 's be honest , the only movie he 's made that doesn 't deserve being called a underrated ), and one of my all time favourites . the film centres around a group of kids at the end of one of the worst times in their lives , they have just lost their father , but are still very attached to him . they try to rekindle the friendship they had when they were younger , however , this time they find themselves facing the fact that there 's nothing much to keep them together , and they have no one to talk to .|0
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. Sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.The Evil Below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads.|1
"I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the ""world premiere"" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say, I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I am unfamiliar with the book, purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, as I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by Jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me."|1
This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet . Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who gets a call for a man wanted for the murder of his friend. As the story begins, we see several men looking for their friend, but all are killed in the ensuing firefight. After the death of Van Damme's friend, he takes the blame for the death, but we quickly learn that his friend is not involved. This is a great film, as it really shows how the killing of these men really affects the lives of the police officers who are protecting them.|0
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might).|1
This movie was probably one of the worst movies I 've seen in a very long time . A friend who I used to go to the theater with had to put his wife on the list due to her mental issues. When the movie came out she was still upset by this and she refused to buy tickets. She said that there was too much blood in the movie, and she was not into it because she was already in love with a different person. Now that she has gotten over the movie and she loves her husband, she has to get the movie from the theatre again.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
Inappropriate . The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA . Whale Rider should get a PG rating , that would be a big step towards making the film more accessible . . A PG would allow it to run more in the theaters . I can’t believe this is the fourth time that the film has gotten this rating. The first time I saw it was the first time I saw the PG-13 rating on my VHS tape. The second time, I saw it on TV in Canada .|0
The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I 've ever seen . Aside from its lack of any pretense or pretense to realism , it does have a good dose of absurdity to it . It's all over the place and you end up hating it . The Bridge At Remagen had me laughing my brains out . That said , I will not be seeing the movie . If it does happen , it will be my last . I can not believe that I am still alive and that this will be the last I 'll be seeing of War .|0
For those that might send me nasty e-mails , shove it . There is a trend in Hollywood where those that don't agree with everything that is being said go on and on bashing everyone that disagrees with them , or making it sound as if they are crazy . I know I have said this in the past and I'll probably say it again and I have seen it happen and seen people like the ones that I am talking about on here , go on and on and on bashing anyone that has an opinion.|0
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time I was playing . I couldn't do anything with the music either . I think it was more of a shocker because I would have never believed that my parents would really have left me with only 3 years of education . But I'm glad to have known that there was nothing wrong with it . However , I will not be going back to school . Thank goodness , I won't need to . Hi. I am back.|0
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. The twist is that instead of frail old L. Ron Hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood.|1
A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel).|1
I 'm not a big fan of musicals , but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth 's looks , which I'm sure are similar. I really like the character , however . She has some good character development , and she seems to have a good role in the plot and is not a typical role for the actress. I would see this as a role for a more talented actress , but I don't think it will go down as well as I would like. Overall I give it a B , but not a perfect one.|0
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must 've come on and rated this. It was a lot of fun to watch. I think that this movie is well made and really funny, and I enjoyed the humor in it, but I think the way it was done was a lot too long for me. It would probably have been best if it was a quickie and a quickie then a full length. I don't know what I was expecting from this movie, but if I'd have to go on record here, I definitely would've rated this movie a B-.|0
Ca n't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004 because they lost the debate with President Bush. And that they will never find it easy to deal with President Obama on the merits of what he has to do, or what they might have to say. Because, they are told, there is a better alternative. The truth is that there is no better alternative. President Obama has not been elected because he is not qualified to be President, nor because he has not won the popular vote.|0
"Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie ""Paul Renauld"" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim)."|1
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai 's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit thereof  I feel I've seen something I'll always remember: a movie I thought I knew, only to realize that it had actually been seen by many, many others I hadn't even considered myself. I thought I knew what it was; I thought it was a movie that would be a good idea for my collection. Well, the movie wasn't that great. It was a bit of a mixed bag of ideas that didn't end up coming together.|0
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash and he does not even have a clue of how to work his camera, the film moves at a very slow pace , but there is nothing exciting about it. I liked this film. There was some great action scenes. The action scenes got a lot of attention. There were also some decent romance scenes. I thought this was a well-acted film. I found it to be a pretty average film. The plot was very predictable and did not give you much of a story to look forward to.|0
Well , it took them 4 tries , but they finally got it right ! In this 4th sequel to this game i would have to go into the detail how to install the game again, but as the game is a free download it is easy to download and install. There is only one slight thing i would like to add , but i have no clue on how to make it work , maybe someone here has some ideas that would help , would be great to share ! It would be a shame to have to start again from the beggining but we'll do that next time.|0
That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks.|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.|1
Don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you.|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film , I would have told you it was good but I don't see it being any better then the first one. I think what makes this one worse is how the characters in the first movie came back together. The story just doesn't do it justice. I agree with most of your points about how the characters just don't get to the end of the story, but then I would be surprised if there aren't more twists that don't work. I just think this film is going to fail badly at the box-office.|0
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say ""fake"". ""it's never been disproved"" also is a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada."|1
Where do I begin ? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features -- I feel like I am watching the beginning of a much better story than anything I've seen in the past. In my opinion, this is a story that should never end. A few months ago, on a Sunday afternoon, I left my apartment and drove into downtown Toronto. I had only gone a few blocks when I realized that I didn't have a destination and was lost. There was only one street I could take, but it didn't matter.|0
"A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a ""little man gets his chance"" movie, and it's a ""how far would you go?"" movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in as Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse bum. This movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of Lousiana Cajun horse drag racing. He has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. ""had nothing but a filling station and a good horse."""|1
Wow ... just ... wow . There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add my own review since it was released on DVD. It was a nice movie to watch in the theater, and it has some great songs in it. I would highly recommend watching this movie if you want to learn more about the Star Wars universe. I saw this for my son and he said it was one of the most enjoyable movies he had watched in a long time, even if I was a little surprised to see that it was an R rated film.|0
OK , if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies , then you might want to get a copy of the DVD of their first movie , A Bug’s Life, that you can rent from this link , it’s worth it to watch it , you might find it very funny because it is the first one in the series and it’s an old film , the only difference in it is the animation of the characters , the story , the setting , and the actors that are playing the role of the main characters .|0
Never having read or seen the Bard 's original work , I ca n't begin to compare this work to it's predecessor . I have read some of his poetry and it is rather good , but not what I wish it to be . This work is a disaster in my opinion ! I have never read or seen the original work , so I cannot say as to how it compares . If this is the best Bard's work , and there is no other way to judge it , then why did it take 3 centuries for someone to write an original version , and not a translation ?|0
Would be promising if it were a student film. Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.|1
Wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life.|1
There were only two redeeming features about this movie ; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture , and the beauty of the ladies. We all are lucky that we got a chance to see this lovely movie, but it would be great to have more films like these. It was a surprise for me and my wife to see this movie in cinemas, when we were lucky to catch it in the cinemas of Bucharest, a beautiful city near our residence. The movie was very interesting and beautiful. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the narration of the actress.|0
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the `` thief '' was so obvious, I didn't know what I was supposed to do."" ""But, by the end, I found it very funny."" ""It's a shame he was killed."" ""I do have to say, it's nice to know that someone else is laughing."" ""Well, now you can say it with me."" ""Well, now I feel like an idiot."" ""And the best part - the thief was my friend."""|0
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another Hollywood CG/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable whatsoever. Designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of Theodore's butt.This film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed for the worse for this movie.|1
"What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this . Folks, the IMDb's rating for this film is rated R. The only reason you'll find the film's IMDb rating is because the movie itself doesn't pass that particular cut-off. That IMDb rating is only for its trailer, which I don't think qualifies as a ""rating"" because trailers should not be used for ratings. I have no idea what this movie is. I have no idea what is in it. All I know is, this movie was terrible."|0
"Alright ! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with some sort of cybernetic implants. We'll have much more to look at as we move ahead, but in the meantime enjoy this trailer! The trailer starts off with a big flash of green. ""I'll be right back..."" A cyborg, seemingly out of one of the recent movies we saw. ""How...?"" she asks. ""How long?"" ""Two or three minutes?"" she asks. ""You don't look that far off!"""|0
I hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, I had to say something.I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it.This movie is one of my favorites of all time.|1
"I don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...Fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies I've ever seen. Not sure what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with ""Scream""?"|1
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good Saturday night movie. I wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.The dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character.|1
I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos.|1
* some possible spoilers * Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original and there is still a huge amount to learn, but there are still a lot of interesting things in here and that’s why we will see it on the big screen one day, but not now, for now we’re going to review this movie from a few angles, from a different perspective, and discuss it from a certain angle, which we will do so from the beginning, before we get into the major plot points.|0
It 's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches at the Lyceum Theater on April 24th and 26th. To be fair, I should really say it was a pleasure to see. The play is a musical comedy about a man and a wife who decide to get married but then, in a big twist of fate, they discover that they are not the right person for the job... They are the wrong people at the right time. It's a great story-line. I know, it's not a comedy but the story-telling and the production were quite good.|0
I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up.It's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. They may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't.|1
The Toxic Avenger... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror... I even have read of a cult following with this series.... Now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that I couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think was to be the horror part of this movie...drug dealing, sumo, Godzilla entrance....|1
I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering `` The Dain Curse '' . My story is told in detail on this DVD, but here are the highlights... The film opens on the evening of the 16th of December at a ball in London's Savoy Hotel on the site of the hotel where `` Dain Curse ' ' is said to have begun . . . After a ball and supper, a group of men gather to drink and discuss who will win the contest to decide who will be the next to be cursed . . .|0
I thought this movie 'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher . Well I was totally wrong . There is a bit of a story to this movie that i would love to find out . I hope i can find out about the story that was not given to the director of the movie and if he would give us a few more details about the story . There is no reason why this movie could not be a romantic comedy , action thriller or even a family comedy . All of them would be awesome to see in the cinema . If this movie was to be released on DVD .|0
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are paper thin. The exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. The worst part of the entire movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.I can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced.|1
It looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. The film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. May god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new one and only reason why I never will want to see (or trust) an Australian made film again.|1
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore . I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted the wrong movie for awards. LOL. Now I have to wonder how many times a week people are going to type in some random movie to vote for their favorite. I wonder if they use IMDb because it gives an accurate description of the movie as to where it was made, and the genre, and the age of the actors in the movie. And then they type in their name, or the first letter that pops into their mind after seeing the name.|0
In London , the Venetian Carla Borin ( Yuliya Mayarchuk ) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved friend. The first question that she asks her friend is why there is no spare space in her flat. She also finds it difficult to explain her plans to her flatmates. Soon all the residents are excited by their new neighbours. And one of them wants to share the same living room with Yulia and her new friends. But what does the new tenant want to live there for? And why doesn’t her flat-mate want to share his or her place?|0
This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil' Pimp must lay down for his homies.The animation isn't very good in this.|1
"`` Garden State '' is another of these `` indie '' -type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for artistic purposes. I don't know about you, but I can tell that there's something weird and wrong with a lot of this stuff. I'd like to think that there's a lot of creative people out there who know that this is crap. And they don't buy it. They don't see it that way. And if there's something that's just off with this stuff, maybe that's a reason they won't want to buy it."""|0
`` Catchfire '' or `` Backtrack '' as it is sometimes called , is not very good . That is what you are thinking . In fact if you can get it right , it is a great tool . If I can show you the code of the program , I would be really happy . But if you are not able to get it , I will be even more happy ! Now you are all set . Now I will tell you the very basic idea of the program . It is easy . You do not need any extra program .|0
Wow . I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago , and I do n't think I 'll ever get into it . But there was one person on that list who did and I have a feeling she'd probably find something to enjoy about it . I can see it , and it might be interesting , but to me I don't know that I would enjoy it . Maybe I would find it all a bit dull and repetitive , and not all that exciting . I do like to see how people react to an anime , and I'm not really bothered by how the story ends .|0
A notorious big budget flop when released . This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally great one-liners, but it doesn't do anything for me, despite some of its strengths . The film centers around an aspiring photographer who gets his work noticed by the director of his favorite restaurant , who asks if he can join the crew. It's a risky move as the man who hired the photographer has a vendetta against him and the film has some rather nasty language, but the actor playing the artist's boss seems like he might be capable of being charming.|0
I thought this was a great action flick . A very good role for Geena Davis . She is a bit like Audrey Hepburn in some ways . Davis gives a very convincing portrayal of a very nice young woman and is a joy to watch as she falls in love with an older man . I've seen a lot of people saying that the movie was not the best the cast could do but I think Davis did a pretty good job. I found myself laughing a few times throughout the movie but it wasn't because the movie was bad .|0
"I caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.There are situations that are left for your interpretation to ""find out"" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.The technical aspects are very good."|1
No pun intended . I 'm not going to spoil anything about the story , but it 's safe to say that there is something in the works . But i have no idea if it will even be finished. But we will see . It might be good or bad . I don 't know . At the end of the day , i'l take a stab . The story 's got me intrigued . So if you can tell me anything , it 'll help me out . Please keep it short and simple , if possible .|0
I 'm not sure where to start with this . In short , it was a disappointing movie . Having seen the first 3, it was time to go back and see the ones that were better . But if you want a fun romp , well that one you should really not be disappointed . But the one to go with the book was the third . The book was fun , but the movie is like the 3 previous ones . I really enjoyed the 3 movies and the one book . I think I will be back for more . One of my favorites.|0
This is strictly for Pryor fans . Just because he was a great , funny guy does n't mean this is true. You don't know him, so it is hard to believe anything he says or does. The whole 'Pryor was a liar' line was a complete fabrication. And the fact that his wife admitted it was true should have made this a much bigger deal. He's not gay. He was straight as a sheet and had no sexual proclivities at all. I can't believe someone who claimed he was straight would get so angry that he decided to tell people that he was a male prostitute.|0
Visually , this film is interesting . Light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an excellent score , that make it an extremely enjoyable movie to watch . The film follows the events following a suicide bombing at a movie theater in New Orleans in which the film is the focus . I think this was the first movie in the recent era that I feel had such an impact . The film had such power and resonance . The film was made in the aftermath of a massacre that took the life of thousands of people .|0
Sometimes there 's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe . This is one of those movies that is not so bad you just want to see it again because of what it could have been . But it’s only because you can’t stand to wait any longer . In this case, the reason why you want to see the movie again and again is the story that has been created . The story of a drug addict and his wife who is a prostitute is based on real events that are well documented in the newspapers and magazines .|0
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage, I have stumbled across this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. Its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right. I was in love immediately. Then, a funny thing happened about the second time around. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie.Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That's very commendable.|1
I saw this film many years ago , and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to be re-released. After reading some of the complaints on this site, I realized that I would love it even more. Unfortunately, after reading the film's critique, I am still torn. In fact, I think I'm still torn about it. It is a masterpiece, of course, but I don't really understand why people are so against it. Maybe I'm just not a good judge, because I still don't understand it well enough to judge whether the critics were right.|0
"Hello again, I have been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. You forget it is the bugs relating to one another. It was just as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such beautiful color in this movie.I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, that I just can't remember the ""why"" of it.Thanks for listening."|1
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie . what a fun film . for the last twenty years the world has been laughing at us as if we weren't even real . we were just some silly cartoon characters with some silly haircuts and some stupid talking heads on TV . well the world hasn't really changed in that regard . we just have a new set of leaders who are now in charge . and I don't want to say too much until the movie ends . but the leaders are no different than our predecessors .|0
"I 'm so glad he was n't alive to see this . This movie is a debauchery of his work. __________________""I'm so glad we have the power to be able to put people back in prison and put them to death for murdering someone else and not being able to get a conviction, but that's what it is. It's wrong. And, it's so wrong!"" It makes sense to me. For a film based on an actual event that happened at the time, I'm amazed it didn't get better over the years."|0
Steven Segal has done some awful films , but this is probably one of the best since his career took off as a teen. The latest offering from the prolific filmmaker has just been released in select theaters, but I highly recommend watching it in a proper theater. This is a film I have seen countless times but never really got into watching it. I have seen the trailers but not seen the film. This will be the first and probably not the last movie I watch where I am in complete awe of the screen work.|0
Im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw away your life, don't see it!I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!I think this movie is a work of the devil.|1
This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie , but apparently there is a lot more to it. I’ve only seen three hours, but I still feel like this is something that could have been a lot more impactful if the producers had just thrown it at the wall and seen what came through. A few things that I thought could have been cut, but that’s what you get from a third-run movie: the script, the action sequences, the dialog, the music and the direction that makes it all flow together to create a cohesive work.|0
"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the 1930s.Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate."|1
I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS ! ! ! ! This 16mm disaster is full of clichés , stereotypical character actors and bad writing . I had to take it off my list of the worst films that I’ve ever seen , as it was the best part of the show . There is this scene where the girl starts talking to her teacher about her love for her boyfriend, which is really annoying . The teacher is trying to console the girl by telling her “ ” that her boyfriend will return one day . “ “ The girl gets very angry , saying that she will be waiting for her boyfriend forever .|0
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension.MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down."|1
What a waste of energy and money . What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted in his early years and has no talent for this game.He is not fit for this game in fact he is not very good in any other kind of match. He was not a good manager and he did not make it to the level of a manager he deserves to be. In his last job he was the manager of Mexico in the 1970’s where they made the World Cup final in 1970. The team they played against Brazil was a World Cup final.|0
"To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, ""Nosferatu"". However, if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. The premise, such as it is, focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair)."|1
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I thought I might finally have found it, but sadly I have yet to read it. So what I have learned so far I think it’s going to be a while before this book gets to the screen, but until it does then I hope that people will still be reading it and finding out about all the wonderful things we have to look forward to. There are two versions of Jane Austen’s book, and as usual they are very different.|0
Although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. It's just that most of us looked to the X-Files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV.In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker.|1
Back in the 70's, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.We begin in an isolated insane asylum.|1
This is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and mean masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action ? Well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the Alcatraz jail. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low.|1
There was a recent documentary on making movies , that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about the process of making movies. Some of the people included are the ones I know personally, some are friends of friends of friends. The topics discussed were about how to write a screenplay, how to get an agent, how to get a budget, and how to go about finding actors to star in your movie. I really enjoyed the documentary. One thing in particular stood out to me. You see this in so many of these documentaries.|0
Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'Department S' to sort things out.Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases.|1
One of my favorite movies . I like horses , I like happy endings , and I like Walter Matthau . If you like these films, you should check it out and enjoy the movie . This is not an official trailer , and I can not guarantee that I will actually watch the trailer . However there is a lot of information that might be useful. The movie was originally titled , but then the title changed because I wanted to say The Horse Whisperer . I am not a fan of horses . And I had to change it back because the horse Whisperer is just not an appropriate title .|0
"eXistenZ was a good film, at the first I was wondering what is going on, organic ""pods"" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.But once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.Security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !"|1
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not, admittedly, all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.Nonetheless, we haven't seen it filmed this well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.I was reading Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."|1
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and I think the script intended disastrous results.Lets start with the one thing I really did not like about this movie.... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this B movie.The best thing was John Rhys-Davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.|1
"In case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. That's pretty much the extent of the movie. Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and ""NYPD Blue's"" Jimmy Smits."|1
"This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, ""Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?"" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo."|1
Why would I say that ? Because when the movie ended , I was in a good mood . So I thought we can make a sequel, I will not give you an spoiler . I mean , how many of you had the same feeling while watching the movie ? If you do not have such a feeling , then I am not sure what to say to you . But you asked me to give you some information that might help you in future, right ? If so , it will be a good thing for me . Anyway, you asked me to make something for you .|0
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch . Too unreal, like the whole movie has been pulled together with CGI. It was hard not to get emotional in this movie, but there was a time where some of the movie scenes seemed like it was made up from a movie that never happened. And there were scenes in the movie where we didn’t really get to see what was happening, or the way the movie was being shot, or what was going through the characters heads at that moment.|0
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. You won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it.|1
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years . It struck home . For those of us who tried to keep it short it’s a great way to give it back, but I think the only way to do this would be to have it chopped in half, then you could do an even better job, or perhaps one of the other editors would do this. So I think I’ll do this. I had been meaning to do an interview with the editor. I just hadn’t gotten around to it. I did it when I first came to the magazine.|0
This was a great movie . Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness that is Black People. The music was great, the cinematography great, the dialogue great, the story and characters were great. The performances were great. If you like action, drama, emotion, and a good story then this is a must see. I will watch it with my family. It is rated PG-13 so I guess I should warn you that it might leave you a little emotional and a little angry after seeing it.|0
With a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it.|1
"I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. The acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood's actors appear life like. ""Sammy,"" the lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character."|1
Let's get right to the heart of the matter...This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead Actors look like they were forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in pain.|1
"As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, ""Gag me out the door."" I would definitely vote this movie on IMDB's Worst movie list.Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure."|1
This is one of the best martial art(Kung-fu) movies of all time. if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. From flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line. Its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the shaoulin fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts. after killing key members of the shaoulin temple the faith of the shoulin is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a shaoulin monk.|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan . I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It is a must see movie in my list of favourite movies of the year and also in my list of most watched movies of the world. I was so excited to watch this that i didn't even sleep the entire night. I could just watch this movie and forget everything else in the past and just watch. I can't stop watching it. This is why I have chosen this movie to be one of my favourite movies of the year.|0
"Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes."|1
I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But perhaps that was because I never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, I have to say it was no way better than number 5. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects.|1
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The Bible. Of course it’s not. I don’t really care that much about this film. The Bible isn’t really that big of a deal in this movie. I’m not going to spoil it for you. I’m just making a statement about one movie. The Bible is not that big of a deal in the movies. I don’t really watch movies based off the Bible. I read the Bible.|0
"This movie reeks. No money, no acting, no nothing. I caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it ever got released to US television! Nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet ""monster""... I can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is."|1
I have viewed this cartoon as a child , a father , and now a grand-father . It is my understanding that children , in general , can not speak to their father , a mother , and another father , as they have no memory of a father or of a mother . In the case , the father , the grandfather , the father and mother , the father and child , and the mother and daughter , are all talking together as one , as one . As a child , I thought that that would be interesting . I watched the cartoon .|0
As a serious marathoner , I was seriously disappointed in this film . Its target audience is clearly those who run marathons , as its an easy movie to enjoy . Not for those who have run for years and want to relive the event . I will make a post in future when I have a better idea of what to expect . But its not bad . It's just disappointing , but not a bad film . If you have never tried running marathons , its best to just watch the race film . Its a pretty good movie . But if you do run a few , I recommend this .|0
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series . I did not like that part at all, as it made me think it would be better to leave out certain details from the books and leave it to someone else's imagination. That being said, there were some parts I really liked that I wanted to be part of the movies. This is one I'm excited to see. What's wrong with the Bible? The Bible isn't the word of God, for it isn't the literal word of God.|0
Beware , My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to repeat after the 5 minutes or so. It seemed to repeat after the 5 minutes. I'm on holiday from my lovely husband and we were all up in the middle of the night and I was getting worried. I couldn't find where it had come from. I watched it on the laptop and it seemed to repeat at a rate that was too much for me. It had been like this before I had checked it on TV, but it did this for a couple of minutes.|0
Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one Rachel lived at as a child.They say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a Mayberry feel. Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces.|1
This film is good in it 's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget . Looks great and I can see the potential of it, but there's a lot that i wouldn't see coming. I think this movie could be done well , but i feel like a very long and complicated script would be required. This movie could have made it's money on the screen and i feel like no matter how many times it is shown its not going to do much to help the film industry.|0
This movie , although well shot and superbly acted , was awful . I felt as if I was watching something that existed in the past. I really wanted to go out and buy the DVD or BluRay and watch it over again. That’s not a good reason to watch it. The DVD and BluRay is not going to tell you anything . It’s bad enough that the DVD was only released in the USA . The BluRay will be released in the UK ( and probably in other countries ) and I don’t think it should be sold as a DVD.|0
I went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on VHS . this is an excellent film . it has everything . the cast is terrific , the cinematography is excellent , the editing is excellent , and the acting is terrific . I don't think I ever saw a better film on television , or on the big screen . this is a film that you should watch just as much as you would a good television show , and if you don't , you've got to go watch it .|0
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie . From the misjudged , often incomprehensible script onwards Dr. S. D. Patel’s screenplay is a masterclass in directing a movie. “Taj Mahal” is as close as any director can get to a flawless movie. It’s not a masterpiece, but it does the job of perfection we all seek in cinema: to tell the story in the best way we can tell it. I know this is the kind of review you want to hear, “How can you possibly compare S.D.|0
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has gotten his degree. The way he goes in the first episode, it sounds as if he’ll be an Army officer before the year is up. The first two episodes don’t do the character justice, but Haines is certainly a fine addition to this season’s lineup. Let’s hope he doesn’t have a big role in the third episode, as he doesn’t really seem like a leader in this season.|0
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic movie, it is Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a bible thumping Christian or a Mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way.|1
"Incredibly, ""Vampire Assassin"" is significantly worse than such atrocities as ""Tequila Body Shots"" and ""Zombie Nation"" - and those movies are TERRIBLE. Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes."|1
OhMyGAWD ! ! ! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories . Two hippie couples in their 60s are walking down the sidewalk in front of a new building, talking to each other and holding hands . There is an old man playing with his grandkids . He looks over and sees the new building and starts to walk towards it . A young hippie guy who looks like an older version of him is also walking past him . The young hippie guy goes up to them and starts to play with his grandkid . The old man is shocked when he sees them .|0
"The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That's the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of ""liberties"" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable. )The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area."|1
In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He did two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. Assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like The Wilby Conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles).|1
"Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. ""The Vampire's Coffin"" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs."|1
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I wanted to share some of their most famous routines with you here on my website , as well as their classic routines and some of their original material . Of course they never did a routine, so the only thing I’m putting together here is what I saw when I was a kid and when I first met them in the theatre . I think it’s the most famous routine you will ever see.|0
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc.|1
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.In relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. Years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series.|1
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60 's, 60's,70's, and the '80's! This film was released in the late 70's in the United States and in France on May 29, 1983. This movie is the only film in existence that actually exists, and you are welcome to it!! This is the one movie I will always remember watching and re-watching throughout my high school years. The movie is very special to me for two reasons. First, it is from my school.|0
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth . She played well in this movie , but the plot was not believable enough for me. I will say that this movie was enjoyable , but the quality of the film should have been better , and I was not willing to see this movie in theater. I liked this movie . It has a good storyline and good acting . But the movie is just so predictable and boring . I give this movie -3 stars. This movie was very interesting . The acting was good , the story and action were also very good .|0
"Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional Navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the U.S. Navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).Director David S. Ward (""Major League"") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well."|1
"After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan , a metal object in it 's brain, and finds that she's had an accident. She has to get home before she can die. But if you're a detective and you're looking for clues in the past, how can you find out what happened before? This mystery has a twist: while the detective is looking for clues he is also doing his duty...

As the story continues the detective continues to search the past for clues about his wife's life."|0
"Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this ""film"", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. And where did they find these ""actresses""?"|1
First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience.But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic: - No second mask attached to the oxygen.|1
I am sorry to rain on everybody 's parade . Just a little background about me : I like and read all things geeky . This is not that kind of post . I have only been blogging for over a year . I am currently working for an oil company as a technical engineer . My job is a lot more than just a grunt . My employer is in the oil, gas, mining, and power industries . They specialize in oil production . They are currently developing a new type of well . The well consists of several layers .|0
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus , a (fictional) government is set to rule. It is not a perfect dystopia, but we have to admit that we would not want to be in it. The story - the story of this short novel is really about a woman, an alien, and a man. A man who has lost his ability to control his emotions and wants to help her overcome her feelings, a man that wants to help her find her own identity.|0
I love Ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. And the photography is quiet nice. We put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. When we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. About halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little.|1
I would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was awesome just the same.I also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one.|1
"I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this...ever! My favorite part is when Grace(Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, ""WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?"" I do believe everyone(No matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile."|1
I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well... not so bad. Genre: scifi...good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was looking forward to have a relaxing Sunday evening watching it. But but...NO.As in summary, this isn't a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. Movie starts with a epic abduction story: Driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... Well, actually that was the film.|1
"OK , most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake , but at the same time , it's about as close to what we'd expect as anything, and it may be the most ambitious game we've ever made , so we decided to throw out the rulebook and see if we could make it a good game , and I'm sure that it will be just as entertaining and fun, so let's start the game and see what it's like :D

Oh, and I'm still on the fence with the name choice and I'll let you decide ."|0
See Three Colors : Blue and Three Colors : White . They are both wonderful films and will give an excellent opportunity to watch the films for free . If you have a chance , please check out it . I was really shocked . It’s really excellent . It’s a true masterpiece . It’s a must see . This movie has a story about a young boy who tries to find out the truth about his father . One day, the boy is traveling along a river . Suddenly , he is captured , tortured and tortured for 3 days without any food at all .|0
Writer & director Jay Andrews , a.k.a . Jim Wynorski , serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a new short film, “Pump Up The Volume”, which you can stream below. “Pump Up The Volume”, which Andrews wrote, directed and edited, is an animated short featuring characters from popular animated series. It’s a goofy little film which you may have missed the first time around but you should definitely check it out. “The short has a great sense of humor, some great music and features some awesome animated effects,” Andrews told me via email.|0
Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.Seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme.In Marked for Death, Seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation.|1
"Let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it ACTUALLY TRIES TO COME ACROSS AS A SERIOUS MOVIE. From the terrible acting... ""I knew it, I knew she was possessed! ""...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. I am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. This may just be in a class all its own. The kicker is that supposedly some Cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation."|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, go up to an Arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover there's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is, after a certain dog lashes out, anyone could be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show.|1
A beautiful film . One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed . Made me think that there is always a reason for our lives and it is not always good but it is not always bad either . In that moment my life was changed forever. It is not perfect but it is something I would never take back so if you see the movie and I am not going to spoil anything it might be worth renting it in order to see how a beautiful girl comes into this world . I think the film will make you think about all that you have accomplished in your life.|0
`` Tumbling Doll of Flesh '' by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse , beat , torture , and kill the innocent . It was created by Japanese director Yutaka Kato , and it was directed by Tatsuhisa Hoshino . It was published in 2005 . The story was first published in JET magazine , and it was re-published in 2004 in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Magazine . Toshiya Kuriya wrote the story , and the screenplay was written by Yuta Sankai . The music and lyrics was written by Hideki Inoue. The film is produced by the Kato Production .|0
STMD ! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I 've seen in quite some time . It uses a rather unique style to make the audience laugh. The actors are wonderful. The film is quite simple and the acting is not that good. But this is a film that anyone can get into. You should see it for yourselves. Here are some reviews. I hope you will go and enjoy this movie . I enjoyed the movie and found it very enjoyable . Thanks to all the reviews I found on the internet .|0
"From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again . This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of why you shouldn't let a bad movie stand in your way

“If you could write a screenplay, what kind of script would you want to make?”

In the early 80s, when I was studying in Groningen, a lot of people used to go to the cinema with their young children and show them films they thought would be most interesting for them to see, including horror movies and comedies. Many of these movies turned out to be good but many, many more were bad films."|0
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time . In fact , I want to see him in a movie that isn’t a horror movie . This is the sort of movie that will give me nightmares . Now , you might think that this is because of the acting and all the special effects but let me say right now that this doesn’t matter a bit . Now , you may have noticed that I have not really liked this film . Now , I was wrong about that .|0
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. I actually ran across this movie by accident. I was taping another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates...who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values (religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family.|1
"OK , when I say `` wow , '' I mean , `` Jesus , please help me . '' I just don't know , how to pray . I'm a really shy person and it's very difficult for me to speak to God . I really hope you are able to hear me . Thank you

Dear God , I pray that You will help me . I'm looking for someone who is very open minded , to talk about anything and everything that is on his mind . I think that I have a good heart and I love to laugh ."|0
I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it.|1
Christopher Nolan 's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out . Shot on a 16mm camera, ' The Dark Knight Returns' is an adventure tale that features the titular knight ( Heath Ledger as the Joker ) as well as his loyal sidekick Harvey Bullock ( Russell Tovey as Harvey Dent ) . The film was shot in New Zealand , but the New Zealand government blocked production of the film in 2001 because it was filmed in the South Island . The New Zealand Government also denied permission to the production of the film in 2003 .|0
I 'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie . . . He has to be a major star if he's doing this much, and if they're going to use Zack's name and persona, it is probably best that he don't go any further. He has to be a major star to play this part, and I'd rather not see him doing this in a movie where I don't want to see him playing any role at all. He's the guy I would want on my team.|0
This movie purports to show a middle class family 's attempt to figure out what is `` going down '' in the middle class. At first, the middle class seems to have a sense of complacency. The family decides to put away their money and live comfortably for the next few years. And it is this feeling of ease that has them feeling comfortable enough to have sex, or for that matter eat dinner. And this is how the movie goes on to show how a few people are able to get the upper hand when it comes to women.|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
If you have n't read Tolkien 's masterpiece ; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever ! If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you to go and see it ! You won't get disappointed because it's such a great experience ! I have a few reviews from my friends who have seen it and they are really impressed and recommend it to other friends too ! I 'm not going to review the movie because I think it's a brilliant movie ! It's an epic story and I really love it !|0
One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen . Since these are not characters in this story it doesn't matter where they come from. As a gay guy, I don't like movies that stereotype us. It's just not right to make us so stupid. We don't all look like the gay people on the tv, and the ones in the movies seem to be just there to make us look stupid. There should be a line in any gay romance movie where it asks you if you would be willing to take a gay lover.|0
Yeah great cult TV series . Great atmosphere , top script and good performances make this a class A candidate. But I am going to be critical about the story because it just is not good and that is what makes it boring. This show was good in its own right . I can watch this show without any problem as it was good but when you have to see it with subtitles and when there is a scene or a character that you need to remember the meaning you will get the frustration because there are no subtitles and the story itself is not interesting.|0
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals , it 's a classic ! > Rita Hayworth is in top form , she just makes me want to dance ! I had no idea Rita had all this charisma , she is a great actress , as well as dancer ! I would not mind seeing another musical like this one ! And it is one that should be on the air in the states in the fall , so if you are in the states this summer please go and see it , it 's an old classic ! Marilyn Monroe would make a great Bond girl. I would love her.|0
"The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I've seen in a long time -and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This piece of work seems to have been made ""under the radar"" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust. film making.At times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. But the stunning aspect of the film by Alex Frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction."|1
I 've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004 , when I stumbled onto `` Cidade de Deus / City of God .'' The story itself is not a new one, but I was intrigued by the film itself. It is very different than the usual Brazilian cinematic fare I find on DVD. The main characters of this story are not the main character, but rather an orphan who lives with his brother and his aunt. Although the story is set in Brazil, it has a universal feel. The movie was written and directed by Pedro Alves .|0
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. There are petty crooks, political prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army plus some dangerous criminals.They are thrown into battle ill-equipped, untrained and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure.The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting.I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing.|1
"You know the old saw about a train wreck ? The one about how you ca n't look away ? Yeah, well it was true in this case as we found out earlier today when it happened to us . The good news is that I think it will turn out alright, so I will let you ponder that for a few minutes, after I write a few words on what I found out about it . So here's my summary of what happened ,

We were in line at a railway station and all of a sudden there was a massive crash in the station ."|0
"If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc. ), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of ""The Christmas Story"" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way."|1
From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights.|1
Fulci ... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made ? Answer : yes ! In the movie, he played the lead and played the part of a very scary and sad man ... he was the lead character in that movie and played like a scary psychopath ... He was playing in a scene in the movie where we see a guy sitting in a bar, having a drink. He started talking and telling us the story of his life and how he got in the middle of all the bad things in the world and became a hero.|0
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.What then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups.|1
"For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, right then we learn (SPOILERS...if they can be called that) that the Devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! ""Prosatanos"" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for ""human greed"" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris!"|1
"This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust. If it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' (""Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films"") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - I'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. But as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. To sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal."|1
"I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min , luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my money to try the second one. i was surprised when i realized that when you watch the movie it becomes a bit confusing, it is pretty hard to explain the story at the end

i don't get the point that the first movie was supposed to be like this i mean when people see it, they are supposed to start thinking what will happen to them , and after that they will see it in a different way , and then they are supposed to think about how it is suppose to be ."|0
See Dick work.See Jane work.Dick and Jane are married.They are successful.They have a son. They have a nice house.They have a Latino housekeeper.The housekeeper teaches Spanish to the son.The son speaks Spanish.Ha-ha.See Dick get promoted.The pompous CEO is a crook.See Dick take the fall for the pompous CEO.Jane quits her job.Oops.See Dick and Jane out of work.Dick & Jane turn to crime.As a plot device, they decide to rob the CEO.See the robbery get botched.See Dick & Jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery.Yay. See the end credits.Okay, so you've got the plot.|1
"Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement I was able to attend at the ""Rolling Thunder"" screening at the Parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th Dec 2004. Of course the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other movie I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized."|1
I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie . The first 1 hour was very very good and so was the 2nd hour but I didn’t see them. I will admit that I watched the trailer and I thought this was going to be a good film . The first hour is really good , with some great acting . I just didn’t connect to the movie . The story is not interesting , the characters are not developed at all and there are a few jokes in the beginning which I thought would work but don’t .|0
"The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It's the story of a young retarded person, called ""Zep"" (sic). A night, he sees his sister's SM sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! Zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. One man will find them. One man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist."|1
Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious.|1
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey ( producing and starring ) has done but it is more of a comedy of errors than a masterpiece, but it is one of Carrey's best. The film starts off as a joke but once they realize they're in a war movie they start getting a lot of laughs. This one was a bit much for my tastes, not really my cup of tea. There was a lot of unnecessary violence throughout the movie. It is one of the most violent films of the 90's.|0
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen . It 's hard to explain though , because (as you all know ) it's hard to write about something you don't understand . I don't watch any other comedy , because this is just not comedy , but what can i say . Well, here's hoping they make this movie . I would love to see it . The comedy is just too funny not to enjoy. I've seen this movie and it is a great movie , I recommend it to you ! I would say that it was better than the last one .|0
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI horrifying."|1
Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film ? From the opening line `` I'm not your fireman ``, the firemen have a saying, `` My job is to make people comfortable, but I don't take the firefighting side of things seriously. `` I'm not here to make a lot of money, so I don't do well at that. `` I do what I have to do because I am paid for it, but my pay doesn't go very far towards it. These guys were there for the paycheck, just like I am.|0
"Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We picked ""Ik ook van Jou"" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current Dutch filmmaking.The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world."|1
`` River 's Edge '' was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 , and for a year that was one of my first exposures to the horror genre. This is a true horror film from the start and it is as disturbing as anything on the shelf right now. There's a lot of stuff here to shock and horrify - but the thing that really ups the ante for me is the idea that it is the first real horror film since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 1980. It doesn't have the gory gore or the violent shock of that but it is the first true horror film.|0
I do n't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie , i mean really . You got a group of actors that i've never seen . And you got your director who is famous , but isnt he ? I dont know but this whole movie was a waste of my time i just thought they would have been better off showing it to me . I thought i would be better able to enjoy it if i got to see what i thought they were going to accomplish . This movie was just ridiculous . And it was a waste of my time and yours .|0
What is night vision ? Well according to the star ( Williamson ) let 's see ... one package store was built for a star which was able to see through the night without a need to wear glasses. Well, it's not that easy. We all see the light from the sun. This is called ' night sight '. In fact, when the light of the sun comes into our field of vision we can see a lot of detail. So let's look at a very simple example. In the next image, we have four different people.|0
I've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on TV. Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.|1
OK , so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er , sorry . . . space movies ? Because I just found out this week that most of the people who write these kinds of posts are, you guessed it, space junkies. Anyway, it's not really an original movie but it's interesting for what it does with the genre. And there's a good reason for that. This is the first time I've seen an episode that was more than two hours . . . more or less. That's a good thing.|0
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD . I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst shopping in a shop, but did not buy. The movie is rated PG, which I have always assumed to be the reason it was rated PG in the UK at the time (see here and here). However it is rated R with English subtitles. The story line is fairly standard in that the central story is being told from two different points of view; a man who is actually being abused by the other man, and his son.|0
this is horrible film . it is past dumb . first , the only thing the twins care about is each other. second , why don't they ever take care of their mother? i dont get it , it is all the same . they would like each other so bad . they just want to sleep , play and sleep . why are they fighting ? why are they so stupid ? i dont get it at all . second movie is the worst of the three i have watched . not even the first one has that level of stupidity .|0
Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head.|1
Steven Segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is being executed because he stole some money? Some Mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court Justice? Their goal is to exchange the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money?|1
"Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour ? Click to expand...

A good parody will usually be pretty funny. But if the person doing the parody was the most stupid, I think the comedy would be pretty much dead. But it depends on what's written into the parody itself. And even then, you need to have a good understanding of the film to do that... In my opinion, if the writer of the spoof is as dumb as a stone, you may as well go ahead."|0
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago . and , i must say , this is by far the best game i have ever played , not to be compared to all the rest . the story , the gameplay , and of course the graphics of the game are outstanding . if you have never seen this one before , it is recommended you do ! it will not take you long to see why ! it is a very unique and refreshing experience , and is definitely worth a buy . the game is available on steam with a price of 99c ( i think i paid 50c ) .|0
As Muppet movies go , this is easily and clearly the best . It features loads of cameos by big names like Bill O’Reilly, Bill Shatner, Jim Carrey , Steve Carell , John Goodman , James Marsden , Eddie Izzard , Robin Williams , Tim Meadows , and more. There is even a nod to The Muppets in the movie . This is a must-see movie , and if you are not in the mood for it, or if you simply don’t understand the jokes, then it may not be for you.|0
This extraordinary pseudo-documentary , made in 1971 , perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today ... which makes it all the more disturbing when it comes out with an agenda-setting and anti-scientific agenda of its own. It shows how America's scientists and scientists' work are systematically destroyed with no regard for the public's health and safety. It shows how our food is unsafe and that our medicine is not. It is a truly horrific document and it will take a true scientist to see that it doesn't match what we're seeing. Here's the trailer, for anyone who wants to see where this one was filmed.|0
I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema . In the past couple of years , it seems producers and directors are more inclined to create a “comedy” or “silly comedy” as opposed to a serious one. The last few years I have seen so much of it that it is quite difficult for me to separate the comedies and the serious movies because it is too confusing for me. I can only tell you how funny it is to see movies that I love, and how horrible the films I have seen made them. It is very difficult for me to decide which movies I am going to like.|0
This is one of the strangest things on TV . It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Bamburg. The town is not a place but a state of mind for the characters in the program, played by a team of young actors. It is a dark and dank place, full of a sense of mystery, and of a sense of the surreal, as well. It is one of those programs which can only be watched once. ‘The Bamburgs’ are a strange bunch, as you may guess from the title of the program and the setting of the story.|0
What a dreadful movie . The effects were poor , especially by todays standards , but that was forgivable . I have to say , I never expected this to be the end . I am glad , and I hope everyone will have a happy New Year . If I may , a toast ! I have never been so thankful that I have seen all of the movies I have . I wish I could come up with a better toast . I think this is a terrible movie . I will give this one a miss . I don't really care for any of these movies , but these are my favorites .|0
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time that I saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it any more I busted out laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found.|1
Lt. Claude ( Claudio Cassinelli ) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by the captain's widow, the widow of a man who has disappeared. He takes on the identity of the man in order to get to know the other prisoners. In a small town, an orphaned boy comes across a mysterious figure who looks like his dead older brother. Soon, the boy meets another young man, and together, they fall in with a group of thieves led by an old man who claims that his brother has disappeared.|0
"This is a wonderful family sitcom . Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms , The Thin Blue Line , and many more. Here are some of the best moments from the show that you need to check out , if you love Rowan Atkinson. So here it goes. Enjoy! Season 3, Episode 2 “Sailor”

“Sailing” was a good episode of the third season of “Rowan Atkinson”. Rowan Atkinson was having a lot of fun in his acting career and the show’s writing staff also made sure that there were funny moments for Rowan and the audience as well."|0
WOW ! ! Talk about a film that divides the audience ! This is a real love it or loath it movie. It will keep you in your seat for an hour ! As if all of that is not enough there are many other features to enjoy. It’s an engaging film ! There are some great comedic moments. And then, there is also a more subtle and profound message to be had by the audience. This movie has a real heart to it ! So, without further ado let me start by saying this movie is absolutely worth watching.|0
Donald Sutherland , an American paleontologist visiting England , picks up a hitch hiker one evening . Two years later, during a hike through the Charnwood National Park, he becomes the last person to walk on its ancient track before it was buried under more than 200,000 tons of mud. There’s nothing in this picture to give away its significance. In fact it is quite the opposite . Sutherland is the first American geologist to visit Charnwood. Not because he wants to, but simply because of the opportunity he finds himself on the verge of gaining.|0
"Why would anyone make a film like this ? Why would anybody invest in a film like this ? Why would anyone go through the trouble to make such a film ? Well, it was the answer to most of these questions. It was the answer to all of those questions. That’s why it is “The Interview.”

The Interview takes place inside the US embassy in Moscow, Russia, on the afternoon of July 24, the day after a former CIA agent named John Brennan is sworn in by US President Donald Trump as director of national intelligence."|0
Boy Oh Boy, does this movie stink. This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. Only watch this thing when it comes on as a MST 3000 Episode. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to watch it without that show, I would've stopped watching it before it was over.|1
The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ) .The director made this too sappy a production . Maybe it 's the generation problem . Not that I see it as that , but it 's all the more depressing when you consider what it must have cost to get this film. I'm getting tired of this crap, I've already watched it twice. Not saying you shouldn't, but at this point, you might want to check to see if someone else hasn't done a better review than me . What I find interesting is it's not so much about the story or even the acting .|0
Sony Pictures Classics , I 'm looking at you ! Sony 's got the rights to Harry records -- you know what that means, right ? We 're the only people who think we can't do anything better . . . and we just got the rights to do it, so there 's nothing left to say. . . . . I 'm not sure if I want to see it or not, but if it does come out, there's not much more to say. . . . . I have to ask, though, about the music that is licensed to us by Sony.|0
To be honest, I did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I watched the last weeks. The first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual).|1
After just viewing the movie , I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and if I watched it again it would be a lot worse, even the characters are not likable, the acting is poor, the directing is horrible and the plot is really hard to follow! If you like horror, action, and/or violence, this is NOT for you! You really need to get the other two movies, so you will not get bored and keep on watching! So don't even waste your time!|0
Thats what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of getting away with it? In comes Richard Hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. A real BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement.|1
For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living.|1
Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August . I was so inspired and touched . Harry Hamrick is one of the coolest characters in the movie and it was a great moment seeing him . The movie itself had a bit of a feel about it as well . It was such a great film . I definitely recommend it. If you enjoy that style, this one is perfect for you ! Saw this during the Mod & Rockersfest in August. I was so inspired and touched. I love the way it turned out, the costumes, and the humor .|0
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me.|1
I know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. However, unless you really love this sort of art or are a Canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish.|1
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series . Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio , while his best friend Yōsuke and his family are in the US. The animation studio is located in San Fransokyo , and Kentaro's office has a lot of anime related things. Kentaro finds out that his friend is a fan of the Golden Boy anime series , and he is invited to watch the second episode of the series. Kentaro starts to work in the animation studio, and then he meets his friend's mom , and they fall in love.|0
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson 's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit the Frog and friends try to save their lives as a family of four at a house they own on a rainy, stormy night when the power goes out, leaving them trapped in the house. The movie is a little different than I expected, not only because Kermit's parents, Lassie and Fozzie are played by the same actress, but also because we learn a bit of backstory about the show's creators.|0
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster 's . I saw this movie in 2006. So far, I think it is better than I expected and it has a lot of what I look for in a classic movie. I have not seen it since and I cannot wait until the DVD release. I will give my views. I would give it 4.5 stars. This is my 3rd favorite movie and that is saying something because I really love The Matrix . This movie is not as bad as I thought.|0
"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" or any such ""deep"" concept."|1
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen . At first i thought that it was going to be good , but all the way through i couldn't stand to watch this movie . It was so bad that i couldn't watch this movie at all . This is the most depressing movie that i have seen in my life . I don't know how this movie was made . All the scenes that i am watching were just awful . My friends and i have watched this movie many times , and we still can't stop watching . I was really getting depressed when watching this movie .|0
THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars)Pretty poor movie... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his inept son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life. After throwing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I guess is *never* going to act in anything other than TV movies or low budget direct-to-video trash ever again) is called to the scene.|1
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s, Italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films didn't make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and `exploited' by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday.|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper . No respect whatsoever to many other movie scripts . . . This movie has no sense of time . I don't think the screenplay is very well-written . I can't imagine what it takes to write a movie based on a short film. This movie doesn't do a very good job at it . It has no sense of irony . This movie is terrible . And the worst part of the movie is that it makes no sense . And it's all so bad . It's a mess .|0
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen . But this movie lacks everything that made the previous ones so special . The dialogue is terrible . There is a great script but nothing is really happening in it . I have to say I couldn’t enjoy this movie even if I tried . If you want to know why this is not the best movie ever made I think it’s because its plot is terrible . It takes a great movie like The Last Picture Show and throws it out of the window.|0
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life . To know you would kill for a few seconds in this film is absolutely unbearable, the pain and horror are so excruciating that it’s hard to watch. I hope no one ever has to watch this film, I do. I hope I’m wrong about that, I don’t think I am. “I’ve been searching the whole world for you! I have been looking for you in every corner of the world and in every jungle, and all over the sea!|0
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination, dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now playing at select theaters near you. Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look away.For rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.|1
"This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?"" It's that bad."|1
"For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. This is a disjointed ""Cliff Notes"" version of Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching.Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book? The one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench."|1
Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It 's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the loss of her only child, her step-daughter. This is one of those books that you want to read so much that when you finally finish it you can't wait for the next one! This is a book that will appeal to a lot of people. I think it's a must have for all moms. It's also one that you'll definitely enjoy regardless of how you're feeling at the moment.|0
What an utter disappointment . Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead . What on earth was the plot line of this show ? . There is no plot line . The show was not that bad . Just a few characters . The series ran from 1999 to 2002 . A few actors were in the shows but they did not do anything good . The actors who appeared in this TV series were very bad . Why did they keep doing it ? . This show had some good performances but the ones who appeared in these shows were not good .|0
"This is truly , without exaggerating , one of the worst Slasher movies ever made . I know , it's one of those movies where the only thing we do know is, we're not in Slasher territory , after all, that's why I call it ""Scary Movie"". This is just one of those movies where I could never go out and see it , and I know there are many who would agree with me. This is why I say it's one of the worse movies in the history of cinema , and it really is so ."|0
"The film tells you to be aware and conscientious . It also destroys any and all things , the Bible says, that would hinder you , it's against the rules, but in my experience, if you are doing good, you will find that you will get rewarded , and that your life has been improved. The Lord is not in me but in you, because of your hope in his name, that is, the hope he gives you. -1 Thessalonians 3:11,12

Please take care of your health! I am not asking you to go out and do things, but to know how to live with God."|0
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look.|1
So , this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see . It 's up there with `` Crossbones ' . It 's as bad as the first `` Kill Bill.'' It has no redeeming moments , it has no redeeming ideas for the characters. It has no characters with any depth. It has characters with no depth . It 's as if a person who didn ' t care about the characters did not even see the movie . I don 't know if you can really blame this movie , or the actor who is playing all the major roles .|0
This is by far my favorite action movie . But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin character. It's the way it was handled. It makes the movie look like a real story, and then you watch the movie where you get to see Renny in action, and it all comes together. This is the first film that's been like this for me. I'm not quite sure how it did this. I think most movies don't follow the same format. This is my favorite action film.|0
If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then, compared to now.|1
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion! I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role!|1
If you have never heard of Jane Austen , seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation , or have never read a single sentence of her work , you might find this page hard to follow , so let me clarify for you. The story is set in 1795. It takes place before the First World War , which is about to end in the near future. Jane Austen lives in England and is in her early twenties. The heroine, Emma, is an intelligent and well-to-do woman who is about to enter a very exclusive private school with her mother.|0
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes , a hard-working guy doing what he loves , there is no denying his efforts have paid off and he does what he loves. Sykes has been in the NBA since 1998. During those 16 years he was known as a shooter. From the beginning, his shot was the difference. From 1998-2003 his shooting percentage was: 38.5%, his 3P was: 37%. In 2003-2010 he shot an incredible 39.4%, the best percentage in NBA history. And in 2009-2010 he hit 41% in that span.|0
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions.|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world , I think it is better than most over-the-top flicks coming out now , and it’s made me re-think this site a little. I’m going to cut back on my comments and posts. My point is not that this movie is a great example of ‘realism’, but rather that it gives you an interesting view of the modern world and how it is changing for the better. I also think that this movie does a fine job of exploring what it means to live in the present tense.|0
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by MST3K.George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated, overly-theatrical performances I've ever seen.|1
"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf""."|1
First things first, I am by no means a picky movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch to be entertained. I'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching.|1
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad stuff. And what the fuck does that tell you about the rest of our society? It tells me that we're still trying to figure out the difference between what we like and what we want. I have never in my life seen such blatant disregard for basic human decency and the needs of others. Not that I can think of any, at this time in our history, anywhere, at any place.|0
'Oldboy ' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most poignant coming-of-age films ever made.' 'Punching up in the end of one of the best Korean comedies of the 20th century.' 'One of the most interesting films of this year.' But 'Oldboy' is far from a comedy in that it's a darkly funny look at what might happen in the Korean underworld if the young protagonists were ever in trouble. The film begins with two friends named Park Tae-hyun (played by Park Hae-man) and Kang Tae-sung, who meet and begin to study together.|0
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because I'm telling you, its just awful. The acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. And the werewolf? Its like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is that bad.|1
"I wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. Frankie Muniz of ""Malcom in the Middle"" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways."|1
First of all , the nature in the movie is beautiful , and there is a bit of Mongolian music in the background which makes the movie look like an ancient Chinese movie, but still a good movie! It's a very simple story which you don't have the time to go into a deep and complex background, you have to go with the style and the feel of the movie. So , you have to leave it and just enjoy the movie, even if it has a bit of a mystery in it , it will give you an enjoyable and thrilling movie experience.|0
Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone? ), but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)|1
***SPOILERS*** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. The cast are awful except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent.|1
Without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. If the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven.One wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast. (Well - not really!) The premise is a good one The situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done, but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor said, they changed writers and handed over to someone else.|1
"""Scientists at a remote lab experiment on (insert scaly creature here) and create out of control monsters. In the meantime a crack military team/the scientist's daughter/bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters. One by one they're eaten, all during an ""exciting"" race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters..."" The sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel. I have to wonder just what is going on? Sure..."|1
What a silly movie . While it looks nice , it does n't make a lot of sense . On one hand it looks like one of the greatest things you can do to your body . Then on the other side it looks like all of us need to go through the whole process of a detox . I mean really what is the point ? Well the point is you can do so much on your body without a detox . Sure you can lose weight . But it's not like you are getting a real body . You're still getting rid of unwanted fat .|0
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens . It showed the first 10 pages of what was to be a 4 page story. After that it was split in to two. Then it was cut down to 2 pages. The film was made for a total budget of about £1million. The film has been dubbed in several other languages and is also available as a DVD in the UK. “I first heard about it as an adult, reading a book on the internet.|0
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just don't fly, do it? Why then has it received so much praise?|1
Firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. Thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourthly, once a SECOND member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college PRESIDENT will disband the whole class, and NOT turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!|1
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I ca n't believe the amount of bullshit that this season has gotten, but let's look at it from a different perspective. Season one had some of the craziest shit happening in this show ever and I mean that as an understatement. Season 1 was so awesome. In a way that makes sense considering the series is in Finland and that the writers in Finland are very serious about what they do, but still very fun and funny as hell, there is a reason this season has to have that kind of crazy shit going for it.|0
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault.|1
"I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% top notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep ""FOREVER!"""|1
I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! I've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I will probably continue until I'm 92.|1
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood. If you think that's a bad thing just know I did. I didn't realize what was in my own head until I was 30 years old. It's not something you learn from your parents, or teachers, or friends, or any of that. It is a part of your brain and that is what causes you to act the way you do and it may or may not be conscious.|0
"I really liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good level-design, interesting and clever enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I am not by default against movie spin-offs of games. I thought ""DOOM The Movie"" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll has done here, is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible (well not the length, the movie runs only a merciful 90 min) The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement."|1
I was duped as well. Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get.An hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.I thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.Damn I was sooooo wrong. It was very hard to watch the whole thing.Don't fool yourself. Its not so good that its bad. Its not even that kind of movie.Its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!|1
I too saw this film at a film festival , but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and entertaining , but overall it was a dull piece of work . I would rate it a 2/3 , although I must say I do feel it is worth a 3/5 , given the potential it offers , but as it is now I don't want to spend much money on watching a film based on such a trivial story . I thought the acting was okay , but the acting in this film is a joke .|0
This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down, then moves back up into place again. The sound is crackly, and occasionally fades out then in again. In another scene, the camera man is just visible in a mirror.Then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent... which, believe me, went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer.|1
Fred Williamson , one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars . Cynthia Rothrock , one of the two or three top black actresses in this decade . There has been much speculation about the two or three women who were chosen by the show’s producers as the new lead actresses . I have heard some of this speculation a lot, but it seems as if there’s more truth in it than you might guess. Here’s the deal . One of the reasons why I write about movies and TV shows from time to time is to talk to other writers and critics about them.|0
"Not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie. Gunshot effects are downright horrible. Acting is ""meh"" It is nothing like Far Cry, other than names and the very basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting are completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in northern-ish America in the movie).I loved playing Far Cry. I loved the story and setting."|1
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way.|1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself.|1
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama . The lush settings , the haunting music , the characters, the setting in general . . . It’s a brilliant film. It’s a wonderful film, a film that could not be better. If you are looking for something to do this weekend, you should go and watch this film. It’s not just for the film, it’s also for the people behind the film and those who were involved. If I were to recommend this to someone or to anyone, I would say look at the cast as a group.|0
This is the essence of the early eighties ! The malls , the credit card machines , the food , the internet , etc . I can't tell you about how to have a great holiday without doing all these things ! There are many different things you can do this year. It's hard to remember all the stuff I did last year, but just a quick tip on some of these that are important . 1. Get a Christmas tree. You don't need any special kind of tree for Christmas . I like the ones that go on sale around the holidays.|0
Actually I'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some folks will expect it anyway. First let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... To the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please.|1
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.|1
Oh my god , WHY , did I waste my precious time on this film ? It is pathetic , not even worth the time it takes to say anything ! It is just so depressing ! Why did I make this film ? Because there was a film on the shelf in my house , in my collection, and it was a low budget movie , about a man who is going insane after he has been in jail for five years , and his mother dies and he is left behind , because she was in love with his step father .|0
This is one of those movies that has everything in it . I do n't think I would get tired of watching it at any point. Great cast , great script , great story , great actors . The only problem is , I had to watch it for about 30 minutes. One of my favorite movies (so far), I absolutely loved the ending. It was so suspenseful. I really wanted to like this movie, but I wasn't expecting it. The ending is a little over the top. That's not a bad thing, but I'm really glad that they pulled it back.|0
"Dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and Todd is his Masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale- ""A Little Priest"" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy."|1
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped airing it. I wish Indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days.|1
'Helen of Troy ' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War . This is more or less a reworking of the story as it was told originally, with only minor alterations. It is told in the form of an episodic story, but the characters and plot are largely the same. I have chosen to follow the plot as it was originally told, and to make some minor changes. The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, the main story of Helen is told, and the events of the events of the war are set in the background.|0
This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (the Sandy Dennis character) apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis.|1
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one.|1
This movie is not the scariest of all time , but it is a great example of a campy eighties sci-fi disaster movie. It’s not the best, but every movie has some of the best campy elements in it. This movie is actually pretty good, but I can’t help but think it is a step down from the other campy “science fiction” flicks like The Day The Earth Caught Fire (1987), Contact (1977), and Armageddon (1989). I’ve seen those flicks just about every day for a couple years now.|0
This movie is a great film . The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film . Driving and sex are the two important themes . This movie is all about driving and sex . It is so funny and sexy . It is just the right mix of sex , action , driving , romance . This movie will definitely have you satisfied . It is a movie which you can enjoy anytime . This movie will keep you going till the end . The story is just that good . One more thing, this movie will give you satisfaction , and that’s the only reason to come out of the movie .|0
"The reviewer in Variety said this was ""overwritten and overlong"", and I kind of agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the US in kind of an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970's ""guy must find meaning in his life"" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal."|1
I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse.|1
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a.|1
Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler ( A real acting stretch ... ) named Rip , who is forced to take a long road trip across America to save the day when he finds a body of a recently dead body. In order to help him in his mission Rip has to learn to use his unique talents to his advantage. The film was originally supposed to star Kevin Smith , as well, but he passed on the role. Instead, a number of other WWE wrestlers were cast to play the roles of Hogan's friends.|0
You 'll feel like you 've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible video. I could not believe it was happening to an innocent little kid. What kind of a sick world do they live in where people just don't care? This kid deserves a whole new life, and I hope I get to share it with him one day so I can give him a chance to feel the love of God again. If I have to pay for his treatment, I can't wait to watch it with him so we can talk about what happened.|0
I love this show. It's clever and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. As David Morse ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the show.I think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre.|1
It 's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia . Apart from very distinctive differences , the photos look the same ! On another note , how come only the photo on the left is not on this thread !? And how come that it is on the first ? Oh yeah , the right one is not in this thread because I am too tired and don't feel like bothering with this discussion, let me know by commenting here ! That's right ! The original photo, on this thread, is indeed an original of the Princess Anna Anderson.|0
There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting , plot , effects , continuity , etc . The film starts off with a strong action and then it develops very slowly till the end . The action is good and the stunts are very effective . The acting is of course excellent , but it goes beyond that . The story is very well told and it keeps you hooked till the last minute . The film is excellent , and has all the elements that a good movie needs . The cinematography and music are very well used and the film is well shot with excellent special effects .|0
In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash ! ! ! ! ! ! The actors were simply not believable . Every single character was completely unbelievable ! In fact they are more believable than all the characters of the second film in the series ! And the only thing that makes the second film in the series worse is that the whole thing starts at the very same time . And in the first one the audience never really gets to the second part . It is always just a re-run. And it has never made it to the second movie .|0
I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. It took place in Japan and the storyline was about a young boy who was taken away with his family from a village to a city. After being there for several months the child’s parents decided to bring him home because they were too old to go back to their village. When they arrived in the city the boy’s parents thought they had made the right decision when they brought the child home with them.|0
"The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner ' that just aired was at least up to scratch on its first appearance on this side of the Atlantic. An episode of BBC television drama Man to Man that aired on 8 September 2015 and had the tagline, ""It's a long way to the top but it was worth the effort."". On the surface, ""It's a long way to the top"" is a bit of a cliche for a television drama series of this scale. But it does have a lot of truth to it."|0
"""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie. But if ""Lifeboat"" (wich unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time (the early 40's) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, not discovering this film isn't really a lost.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it's rather hard to find the Hitchcock's touch."|1
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive , which was a very good film in the low budget horror vein. It didn't get made, but the novel was published by L. Ron Hubbard's Hubbard Publishing Company. The novel was also published by Hubbard himself (with some revisions made to the novel before publication). This novel is an adaptation of the screenplay from the original film (see below). The film was shot in London, Canada, Germany, France, Belgium, Japan, and the UK. The film is based on a screenplay written by Ron Howard and directed by Howard.|0
^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap. Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. No one can even cry believably.If you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.For example, I left the room for a second, while Jennie Garth's character was sleeping with her manager.|1
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years.|1
I rented this film out of the local video store one day , you know , the kind of movie I usually don't watch because it is just so stupid but this one was different because I knew the director so well and could get the details right . This film was so stupid it was hilarious . The entire film takes place in the same location and with the same characters but in slightly different ways , some are funny and others aren't so well acted and some just look like crap but it all makes sense .|0
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman . She has a son, a widowed mother and two daughters. One of the daughters dies in childhood and she takes the other sister into her arms. She then leaves her family and goes with the widowed mother and two daughters. She then takes her two children to Europe . The movie is an American film released in 1946 in the USA and in 1949 in Italy. It was released in a very poor quality, but in the best Italian film that was made from 1947 to 1952.|0
I was sorely disappointed in this movie . Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so badly done . The acting is poor . I have had a hard time watching this movie . I thought it would be much better because the film was not based on a true story . The story is good but the storyline is poorly written . I have never seen such a poorly written story for such a well written movie . I was not disappointed because I thought that there were some good scenes . The acting in the movie was not good enough to keep me happy .|0
"From the crash of the opening theme, ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" is classic 1950's entertainment. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood, where the old scumbags still lurk. This is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and almost steal the show."|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom.|1
I have just seen Today You Die . It is bad , almost very bad.1 ) The direction and editing . The direction and editing is very bad, it doesn't seem to matter what is shown , they have no respect for the viewer , they simply show what they want to , this is not a good movie , they don't know what they are doing here . The movie is almost like a movie , it seems like something out of horror or a movie with horror in it , this should have at least been written in a different script or with a different production company or something like that .|0
"The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for ""emoting"" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would neither recommend nor watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue."|1
"Though it's a Christmas movie, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby."|1
I would say this is a background movie . Play it the background as your tending to busy work (I mean as you work as a background movies) or you might enjoy to watch it the next day or you can watch it later . But I would recommend to watch it when you are not having any work , just watch it , you have some time . So if you watch this movie , and you watch it , you will not regret of that . I am sure you will get lots of views for this . You can go and download it from this site.|0
I was so excited to finally watch `` Pulse '' after receiving it from Amazon , and I have to say that the film is pretty awesome. It is a story of two young women who were involved in a suicide pact that caused a war between the two. The story is about the way one woman's life takes a different path and how a man tries to keep the peace. It is also the story of two sisters and the men who try to help them. The film is made up mostly of black and white photos and the colors are quite simple.|0
The first feature length Muppet Movie , and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol , the movie puppeteers the world has ever had had to rely upon for live shows, were the cast of The Electric Mayhem. Although the first feature length movie was a disaster, the cast and crew were able to overcome this in the following years in order to create a sequel in a much more professional and professionalised way, and in so doing, set a new standard in the live-puppet art. Of course, there are many similarities between the live-shows of that era and those of today.|0
I do n't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV , i was blown away at the performances , great cast and screenplay. My favorite moment so far is when all the women fall to their knees while praying to Jesus and ask for forgiveness for all they have done and the pain they've experienced. It really hit me hard when it was just the two of them , not a crew , not an entire film crew , but a few people praying together to the Lord. God bless them all and all I can ever do for them .|0
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously . The movie is called Arachina , and it is based on life story of a girl , which I believe is a great story . There are a lot of things the movie does that makes it more than just a silly action movie , but it's not. I actually liked the movie when it came out , but now, I can't stand it , I've been seeing it since it's release date of August 27th 2013 and I'm quite disappointed.|0
Mute Witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there, a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film.|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear . . . and then ends up getting mugged when he can't pay a bill! It's one of the best episodes of the series . . . if you don't already have a love for the story line and the way it's shot, you're missing out. (It's also one of my favorite Bean episodes.) It's a classic story, and I highly recommend it for young children and anyone interested in how the Bean family operates.|0
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides . Then again , are these really suicides at all? She gets a message that her partner is on the roof and wants her to meet him there . When the man does meet her , he wants her to sign something . It is a suicide pact . But when she signs the pact , the man goes away . Why? Is he leaving because he is leaving because she has not signed the pact ? or has the act been misinterpreted by her as an act of suicide because she has not signed it .|0
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack : I 'd give it ( soundtrack ) a 9 out of 10 if they'd just leave it be. The only thing i'd like to change is that the movie was made a long time ago so it would've been better than a generic action movie

Well i agree that the soundtrack was not the main thing but it was the best part of that movie. But the whole plot was just to make you forget about what you have to do and enjoy yourself. I wouldn't say that it was an awful soundtrack."|0
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 , I dismissed it offhand , saying it was too “cartoony” to be true. And then when the film was finally made available I found myself getting into it, because I was so interested. The story is about a “manmade” virus, with a very specific purpose, that was deliberately released into the population of a city, and then unleashed to kill everyone in the surrounding areas. I have no idea if it happened, or if it didn’t.|0
THE QUICKIE ( 1 outta 5 stars ) Pretty poor movie ... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who goes on the lam and starts a gang war that ends up wiping out everyone on the planet. I'm surprised no one has made this movie available on the VHS store ... but I can't get into this movie either because it is just awful. It doesn't hold up on DVD. It's the kind of movie you don't want to get into unless you're dying for a good gangster flick. In short, forget it.|0
"The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of ""The War At Home,"" I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night, while flipping through channels, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it."|1
"I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas , and was totally switched on. I saw it the next day and the first thing I thought was , ""That's a great script. I think I can make this."" So I went to see It and it was brilliant. I can't wait to see what the second book will have in store. I can see it going anywhere from a BAFTA Award-winning project to one of the most critically acclaimed features of the year. There was one scene that had me cracking up in a really, really funny way."|0
Reba is a very dumb show. You can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who resembles a real-life person. I guess Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba.|1
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly . It is no understatement to call it farcical, it has more elements of a farce than anything you would expect a film made in America to have . In fact in some parts I have to admit it reminded me of a farce . I don't like farces . I saw this film at the Cannes Film festival and although I liked it ,I was not surprised . I saw the trailers on the internet . I was amazed at how well written this film was and that it was made by American people.|0
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don't know how many times.Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer.|1
`` Rififi '' is a terrific heist movie , and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since: it's the only film in which the protagonist does not possess the ability to steal, nor the means to break in to the vault. The film doesn't tell us much about the criminal's background; it just shows us one of his crimes. We don't see him actually doing it. We only see him steal the money, then we find out what happens after the robbery, after the heist is over and the criminal is arrested.|0
"They call this film ""euro trash horror"". Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's ""euro"". Trash? Ah yes, it's trash all right.You know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. Expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. Plus there's the sound -- at first I thought I was watching a dubbed film."|1
"""Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father""- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her."|1
Right... so you have a dam, tons of water (that seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens to be right underneath the dams path of destruction. Throw in a profiteering glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting. All in all, when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view... I would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay-per-view film. If you want a laugh... then you really need to watch this film.|1
"I 'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview ( yes , SOS ...) for training. But in this case, I think I see a big problem:
We can train on this vessel and they will send it back with an EOS. The EOS needs to include all of the EOS training that is taught on these ships, which I believe includes an entire training session on how to use the EOS and how to maintain the radio. Is it fair for a submarine to be sent to a foreign country on a ship that doesn't have these basic things taught?"|0
As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager , I tend to watch all sorts of films. Some of my more recent favs include: Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith , The Hunger Games: Catching Fire , Star Wars: The Force Awakens , and The Chronicles of Narnia . I recently had the opportunity to get a chance to review a film called The Lion King . For those not familiar with the film or the characters, The Lion King is the most successful motion picture ever in the history of cinema.|0
This movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. And the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time.|1
I'm racking my brain, but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You gotta wonder why John Ford and/or John Wayne never tried it! The plot  While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus), and the rest of the cast/characters enter a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but some other, more fearsome creatures as well.|1
I had to watch this movie for a film class , I suffered the whole time through . I am not a huge fan of action , and I thought this movie would be well done , however it never reached that point .I was expecting at least some action and a good story , but there was not a lot to it . It was ok , but not a great film . Maybe I just have a low tolerance for action movies . But I can tell that I would not recommend this film to everyone . There are some good parts of it , but you would have to really want to sit through it .|0
"Jennifer Montgomery's ""Art for Teachers of Children"" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here?"|1
****Contains Spoilers****As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character.|1
"In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called ""stickers"". TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting."|1
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees?|1
This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story is good but the ending was not believable. The characters are well played, and I would like to see more of them though they were not developed. The action scenes were great, but I didn't expect much when it was first announced. So many things are going wrong that I can't figure out how the bad guy even knew it was coming. This could have been one of the best action films of all time if only the writer would have made an effort.|0
I 've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and ca n't seem to do it. I'm at a loss. It looks to me, at least as a summary, that there is a character that is in the middle of a conflict with other people and that his/her actions will cause other people's actions. I'd be willing to consider that it is possible to have a strong character in that role and yet have no motivation or reason to cause other people or events in their lives. However, I'm not entirely certain that it can be done.|0
"`` The Man From Utah '' opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback . This is how the movie begins: ""When the sun shines . . . "" The opening titles are catchy, but they don't reveal what the movie is about . The movie begins as ""a story about a young man traveling across the country and finding himself caught between his father and his sister,"" but doesn't reveal why he is traveling, and how it leads him to his ultimate fate. I think that is what is so important about the movie: the journey of the young man."|0
The plot : Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct , and is looking for his 1st movie directorial job. The film is about an Irishman, Michael Connors, who is sent to the US to fight in the Civil War. He’s part of a large Irish contingent that helps defend Washington DC against British troops led by General Henry Knox, an ex-British Army officer. Connors is forced to go on the battlefield by the general, but he finds that he enjoys the fighting. While on the battlefield he begins a friendship with an Indian girl.|0
Well , I have been to a British University , in fact I went to the one in this very area , I went there because I wanted a career in IT. I wanted to work with computers and do programming . I decided I wanted to start working on this computer game , I did a programming job there and I made some mistakes , it was a very short time there , but I loved it and I wanted to continue working on it . I started my job there and I was in a department that was mainly made up of programmers .|0
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious ; It 's not like American Pie or something . And it 's not as if it was made for teenagers who could not have sex . It was for teenagers who have never had sex . And it 's no where near as sexy as anything that is on the list . If you think it's trashy or obnoxious then you've got a problem . It's the kind of movie that if you want to be taken seriously you'd better get serious . And as it happens , I have actually got a problem .|0
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy's the man. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.|1
Jim Henson 's The Muppet Movie is a charming , funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by anyone. It's also a great film if you've never seen it before. Henson's film is not perfect. It does not follow the script exactly, and there are some moments that are rushed and poorly shot. But it's still a good film that you can enjoy. The Muppet Movie is a very well-produced, fun and educational movie that I highly recommend to all Muppet fans or those interested in learning more about puppets and the world of Muppets.|0
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and ritualism. When the film starts we are presented with a scene of the two women preparing to consummate their love - and that is the scene which really makes it all the more striking. But then the movie shifts gears a little and goes a little deeper. There is a whole sequence in which we are offered a view of what life would be like without love - how we would look at each other. We hear about the different ways we would treat each other in different situations.|0
Better than average World War II-era `` who-dun-it '' featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and who, when he comes to a military town, is recruited for the war effort. In this version of the film, the title character, as a young boy, takes to the streets of a small town to cause trouble for its inhabitants when, for reasons unknown, his father is absent, and when, later, a military unit is called out to investigate the boy, he meets many of his fellow-townspeople. The film was also made on location in Germany.|0
"This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters , but never got around to it . for those of you who have not seen this film , let me refresh your memory on what you need to know before you begin , 
you may not have seen it , but you should see it and learn a thing or two , 
if not , you may be stuck with it . after all , is there one thing you know about this film , is it better or worse than what you have seen on tv ? . as we have watched the film , it has made no difference ."|0
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it! Its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name, but once viewing it...will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside. Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made. However, being unique as it is.|1
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... The film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... If this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... As for the actual film, I recommend watching the MST3K version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother...|1
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, do not see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. It's a chore to watch!Set on New year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film.|1
A great film . Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew . The actors give credible performances all throughout . They are all very convincing . The movie has a very unique style . It gives the audience a chance to reflect . It takes a look at the social issues of the time in Japan . The story line is well crafted . The cast is very good . The music is nice . The special effects are great . I think it is the best film of its kind . It deserves to be one of the top films of its genre . A must see .|0
Man , what an awful film . As with many terrible films , the structure of its awfulness lies in its characters. There are good and bad , but no one is good and no one is bad . The story of a group of high school boys who are forced to kill each others fathers , one of whom is a psychotic maniac , is an interesting one . The boys are not so much the good as they are the bad . There are some good parts : the acting of John Mahoney , Richard Jaeckel , and Frank Thomas is good and there are some great suspense moments .|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that , a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American laws that say not to build near the water. In those times, the owner could build on land which is owned by the state of Arizona. In other words, you don't have to own the land or the river. Today, the state of AZ owns everything but the water and has an agreement with the federal government to sell water to the people. So the people do not own a river but instead own a small piece of land and a few miles of river.|0
First of all , let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - but let me just make one small comment. As I have said above, I believe that in the long run we should all be working for a world of peace, and not for a world of war. And that includes all the other issues you mentioned. But at the end of the day, the world as we know it needs to change for the better, and that changes us. And I do believe in the importance of education.|0
Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it.|1
"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches. ""Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."|1
"I can see what this film was intending to do . Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal . I'm not going to put this film up for free but if you feel like it and you want it, I will gladly give it to you for a donation. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you! :)

The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park . The filmmakers did not follow the rules of continuity of the first Jurassic Park movie as it has been said by many other movies that have come later that Jurassic Park 3 was supposed to take place between the first film and the first sequel as well as the next one but they made it work. This movie is probably the one of the most overhyped movies to ever come out of Hollywood and I must say, I don't think it has all that many flaws.|0
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry in Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly weird Bubba Ho-Tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this TV episode. The plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. This time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac.|1
This fantasy was utter garbage. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, though.|1
Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- I particularly like the two doofuses playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very feckless and yet sinister. Some might gripe about the need for a strong Ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward hits the proper nuances. Amazing. Simply Amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times I've watched it.|1
When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought `` god , this is horrible ! '' But I got over it after I saw this. I loved it. And after I saw the DVD I saw that the episode in the credits that is on there, it is actually the second episode in this season. It is actually the 3rd episode of season 2! That is awesome. I saw the episode in the video store and it was fantastic. I haven't seen season 1 yet, but I will get to that soon.|0
"If I had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful I've seen it'd be this one. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. The movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either-I've seen depressing ""thriler"" type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. Vanishing didn't have that, This was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie."|1
"This movie was beyond awful, it was a pimple on the a*s of the movie industry. I know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud, should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung. I can hear it now, ""You getting' paid?"""|1
A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours . The entire movie could have been made in less than thirty minutes . The movie has one of the biggest laughs in a film and I was laughing for about 3/4 of the movie . I enjoyed the movie . I really enjoyed this movie . My first thought was that the actors were playing a game for the audience . It was like a musical . The actors were having a lot of fun with it . The characters were well written and the acting was well done . A few people on the internet said they laughed out loud at one particular shot .|0
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election. CBS's last shot at throwing a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful yet I'm still watching it. **Minor Spoiler** I think CBS got the same people who ""provided"" the memo's to do the semi cut in half sequence. What is with the bad boyfriend storyline? Can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a Ed Wood movie. Who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing."|1
Very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. It is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. The first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something I've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it.|1
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie. Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I have seen worse acting. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and was really a interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably wont enjoy this, but if you are you'll like this movie.The main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites.|1
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie . Such people are disappointed because it 's about a baseball player . What they fail to understand is that it 's a baseball movie and baseball players are a part of our society . They don 't need to be stars to make a good movie. If they don't like baseball, how do they know about the film . This movie has been made by people who have seen the game for 10 years and it's all they do . This is baseball . I don't think anyone can say they don't know or care about baseball because it's a game.|0
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself ... Am I going to see this again ... I mean ... how will the movie be made ? ... Will I enjoy it ? I guess so ... I want my money back. I don't know about you but I can't wait for this movie to come out. A couple of months ago, I was lucky enough to see the latest installment of the Twilight Saga: Eclipse at a very nice screening at the New York Public Library.|0
Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.|1
I caught this on HBO under its category of `` Guilty Pleasures '' , and I would agree that I am not an exception to the rule. I enjoy the show immensely, and there are many of my favorite movies and TV show's I find to be the best. This is such a great movie. The actors are all so good, and the movie is extremely well paced, and I don't think there is a dull moment to be found. If you liked the movie and don't have a copy of it on DVD, well, this is for you.|0
I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got . The acting was just awful , the dialogue was awful , the cinematography is terrible and the production values in general . I thought the movie was okay in the first half but in the second half the movie starts to lose some of its credibility. The acting was bad , the dialogue was awful , the cinematography was terrible , and the movie was just mediocre in every sense of the word . I can understand the first half and the 2nd half could not. But it was a waste of time and money .|0
I loved this film, Independent film-making at its best. The cinematography , pacing, rhythm , and acting were perfectly in sync. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. And that is just what they did!|1
Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies . Lots of humor and laughs, a few of which I am not sure if were intentional, I will leave it to others to decide if it worked or not. The plot was funny, the actors were not bad, the plotline made sense and you can enjoy it as much as you like. A good watch. I didn't get a lot of sleep in the first two days of shooting. I really wanted to finish this film, but I couldn't bring myself to do so.|0
"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" is a peculiar movie. Like I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors."|1
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem , except to say that it represents young Buster ‘Sully’ Williams (born December 5, 1993) as a young man. He’s already in his first year of junior high school, but it’s not long now. He has made his mark as a senior when he earned all-state honors and the Gatorade All-State team in baseball. He is a three-star athlete and is ready to play in college. We have a few days left to get to know him.|0
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions.|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic , and I must admit that it whetted my appetite for the film. It was very well made and the acting was very good. I had a difficult time watching the film, because I found the acting to be a bit on the overacting side. The lead actress (I won't go into the details) looked a bit silly on screen. I really enjoyed this movie, although it did have a few problems. The pacing was slow, and the special effects were poor. In a lot of ways, this was similar to Titanic.|0
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory , non stop action scenes . I am sorry I won't give a spoiler , but I think that the best part of the film is not the action , more so how the characters react to this type of action . It's a nice change from most other type of action films , and I really like the actors of the film . The film is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick. The film revolves around three brothers , played by Jason Statham , Jason Statham and Jake Gyllenhaal.|0
The Mod Squad is n't a movie , it 's a void . That 's the most fascinating thing about this film , and one that I have never experienced myself. This is the first feature film I have ever seen based on a short story of mine. I was a fan of a number of short stories for years , but none of them were this original or this creative , so this is the first movie that I saw that took me into a world with its own characters that I can relate to and that I have really liked .|0
"It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie's ""real life."""|1
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the characters. this is just a horror movie that gets a 10 for having a decent story and decent characters. you can't just write a good story in one go and then you have a decent movie. if you want a film to get a 9, then you have to write a good story first. the plot was a decent enough story but this is a horror movie and you are trying to put blood in your movie.|0
It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it `` Bigger & Better than it is now ``. It seemed a very good idea, at the time. After all, the TV show was, after all, the BBC’s best seller, its best selling science fiction and fantasy book series ever. So, I was thrilled to learn that Doctor Who would be back at the BBC for a two-part reunion. It also seemed the perfect way to spend the summer vacation. I was also excited to be spending a week with my family.|0
"It 's not fair . I was really expecting this to be a hilarious , entertaining movie . I mean , the main thing I wanted was a story that would entertain . But there was way more than I expected . . ._

Rating : 2/5 - it's a bit of a let down for me , it is a bit predictable , and not as interesting as I would've hoped . I really do hope you do not mind me saying that . Rating : 3.5/5 - you know what you should do when you start watching a movie with more than 15 minutes to fill ."|0
I , like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be a great show . . . but my expectations weren’t in line. There was, in any event, a very strong line up of local bands. This wasn’t just local, it was national. There were about a half dozen bands playing, and in fact, I was a little underwhelmed. But when I got up there to see the show, I thought they’d live up my expectations. There were about 20 people in the first half of the show.|0
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! Awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth!|1
"Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best ""If Walt Disney had hailed from Texas, he would have made Grand Champion"" The movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (G rated) This is a masterfully crafted ""simple"" little film made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb."|1
"First off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said ""well, mistakes happen"" and brushed it off. After about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.Now, about the film."|1
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film . Initially , I was struck by the film's ability to hold the viewer's attention, as well as the fact that the plot and performances were well-written. But as the film continues, I've realized the film is more of a story, rather than a musical, and in that I have grown to appreciate it more. There have been a few instances in the past that I've noticed the film could have been better , and so I'm pleased that this film has been able to hold my attention so completely.|0
"MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a ""light, sports comedy"" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. (Some of the superficial ""sports comedy"" results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how ""basa-boru"" is played in Japan.)"|1
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. There is not one... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. The Crows.... Hitchcock did it superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this film falls short of a well done attack scene. The creepy crawly boy... The Grudge did it and did it better. The psycho...done in Cold Creek Manor most recently, however it has been done to death. No pun intended.|1
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach.|1
"A killer ( John Karlen ) with a penchant for really bad disguises ( afro wig on a white dude ) is sent on a deadly mission by the United States government to hunt down ""terrorists"" ( black dudes )

The reason the government wants to kill him, they say, is because he's killing too many of our own people that they think are terrorists

But he never gets the chance to be hunted down because he escapes from custody

The only one that's ever caught is the one that had to kill him, but who will ever get the credit for finding him?"|0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed?|1
This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small group of women working together to protect a man. The women are not perfect and they are not all saints, but they get through it and do it with style and class. They all work together and do their part to do the right thing. It's no easy task for these women. In fact, we don't even know who these people are. We only know what they do. And that's all we see and hear.|0
"Does anyone else think that `` Reba '' is basically a ripoff of `` Roseanne '' ? Just look at both of these films and tell me if there is even a similarity between the actresses in either one of them. You can't. You see the similarities only when you go to the trailers of the films. If you do go to the trailers, there will always be a hint of how much they have stolen from one another. _________________""I love you, too. It's just, I never knew how much I would love you until then."""|0
"To think this film was made the year I was born. To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of ""homeland security"". To think this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides."|1
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only thinking it was a comedy and really I’ve been pleasantly surprised how well it is actually a good movie. I have to say it was a very enjoyable movie to watch. I found the characters and the humor to be very believable and they are all very endearing. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the different people that the movie is focusing on in it, and I just hope that this will become one of my favorites.|0
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom.|1
"Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch ? Just ask yourself the following questions:

How much time did this girl spend doing magic ? What was the training she did to become such a powerful witch? How much time would she have to spend being a witch to gain the skill to become such a powerful witch ? What is the minimum period of time for witch training and for being a witch in this film? In the beginning of the film she is seen using her magic with the help of her friend."|0
There 's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel , which finds its way to Netflix and, if you like that sort of thing, you will not be sorry for the wait. It’s not as good as its predecessor, but this time, it doesn't feel forced. The original was a high-speed chase thriller in which, as the title suggested, there is a ' chase'. It was a good one, and I think we can be grateful to Netflix for having it back after a long absence.|0
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground.|1
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I hadn't. The movie wasn't scary.The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle. She continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother, and their blind daughter.|1
In Sweet Water , the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz ( Jim Storm ) is constructing a resort in the middle of nowhere, in order to lure wealthy tourists who would otherwise skip the trip. As he tries to sell his dream project in the tourist-focused city of St. Louis, the city tries to sell him the city itself. When the project is threatened with a series of lawsuits, including one by the developer's son who claims that Krantz's property violates city land use laws, it is up to Krantz to keep his project from being demolished.|0
Ever since 1981 , Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda . Most ideas that were conceived in these games can be easily ported to other 3D games as well . Today, the developers of the first installment of the series, Mario Bros. , are finally ready to bring the series to the big screen again , and Nintendo has announced that the movie will hit theaters on July 11th of next year . This movie will feature the voice cast of Mario and Zelda as well , so you'll be able to hear all the voice actors of both characters!|0
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary . One reviewer on Four Word Film Review ( www.fwfr.com ) was absolutely right:

” The Sleeping Dictionary is an unqualified delight. It’s simply brilliant. It is not a particularly subtle film. But there’s such an abundance of it, you’d swear it was written by a writer half-blind. There is a lot to look at and I loved the first hour or two. It’s got a very good script, a good cast and a wonderful soundtrack. The acting is, of course, absolutely incredible."|0
Finally! Other people who have actually seen this show! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. It is just hilarious. 'And so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' And some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience.|1
Okay ... for the most part , and all its cheesiness , this movie was actually pretty good for an 80's movie ... and it's really good that it has that kind of budget, as it's a film that was made on such a modest budget that I have to wonder if that kind of story would have been able to come out in a later movie... In the end, however, it's not a good movie. I saw this movie at a midnight showing with my dad on a very rainy Monday night.|0
I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept, because it was just too damn long and boring. I really wish that I was only reviewing the first half or half the movie and that my review would have only made sense for the movie that I watched in that half. What I ended up doing is reviewing the entire film with the exception of the really bad acting, and I'm hoping that it's a good look at why the film fails to be an epic movie.|0
ALERT : This review contains major SPOILERS . Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from trailers and previews I wouldn't put it in any category unless it was the last film to be directed by Joss Whedon and starring the main Avengers cast. But if you're a fan of the show and have the time I'd definitely watch it and I'm sure it will be good to see what Whedon has been able to bring to the role of Thanos and how he has been able to expand on his character.|0
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by the scope of a film with an incredibly powerful and moving story, which I thought was one of the most powerful things I had seen in any medium at all. It’s the story of Michael, a boy whose mother is mentally ill. After her death from suicide when he is 15, he has to decide whether to go to a youth centre, stay there and attempt to live in peace and with his father.|0
"Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's way better than I expected. Those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. But it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this one to Sinan Çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage ""Propaganda"", this movie is pretty damn good.One thing that MUST be said: It deals with the highschool students' life in Turkey VERY realistically!"|1
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot . I know , I'm a bit biased , but it's actually the best book I've read all year , at least in terms of pacing. The setting is very much like what we see on The Walking Dead . There are lots of zombies , and a lot of them are very, very scary , but the setting is very much a natural part of the world , as opposed to the horror movies that were made for television . I really do recommend it , if you like scary stuff .|0
Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad things are:1. It's very slow. 2. How Ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of Asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home.|1
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie.|1
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. Kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. This role was like many he had made already,One can see why he was a big star for so many years.He filled this role easily like a well used glove.The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a fine actor Robert Walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress Jennifer Jones).Robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films.|1
I was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! Truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films.I did think this one was a bit too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to Caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference.|1
I 've waited 9 years to watch this film , simply because i never saw it advertised on TV . it was not a disaster . i watched it because i had to , and i had to rewind the clock . and i didn ' t care for what happened later in life either . but i think the movie is better than it sounds , and i have a good feeling about the movie . because i think the movie is better for me . this movie is better than a lot of horror films i have seen . but this is not about the genre .|0
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I popped this sucker in. It was worse than I had expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. There was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. Now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were?|1
there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda , that story told about young writer who is very rich and very ambitious and thinks of writing a book about his life . this book is based on this young guy who wants to find out all about himself , because his parents are never around . i think this is a very good film because it's really about self awareness , about curiosity and wanting to learn , but it's also a movie that has some very nice moments that we don't usually see in movies .|0
so if a guy meets you and he says 'I want you to look at my erection!' don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes! that's the only thing what happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I ever saw! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch Lennon's Erection, be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too.|1
Okay , it 's a movie for children , and it 's not one of those movies that adults will like , so I am going to give it a chance . This is my attempt at making a movie with a little help from my daughter . And she 's good at doing just about anything, so don't get your expectations up . . . I will let you know in about a week . This is my first time posting anything on my blog . I have so many plans for this movie . I will share it with you as it unfolds .|0
For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie , another payday in L.A. For some of the major stars and producers who have no idea what a movie like “The Bigger the Better” is about, the film will be more of an “excuse for a sequel”. It will be more of a moneymaker than a film that was a critical and financial success. The cast was made up mostly of the major Hollywood studios. It was a box office and critical hit. The producer’s were not even the ones who brought it to life and put a film together.|0
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever the heck she is. Chauvelin would not randomly shoot Tony in the head.|1
cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive.|1
Oh dear ! What can I say about Half Past Dead ? I was really disappointed in it . I liked it better as a film , but as soon as I saw it as a film, I didn’t like it at all . The story was quite good , though it is rather predictable . I was really looking forward to a sequel . Well, I’ll be able to see Half Past Dead soon and I am happy to say that I have seen it and enjoyed it . It is not my favorite , but it is not a horrible movie either , I can tell that .|0
"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!!"|1
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.OK what about the plot outline?|1
This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time).|1
Imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. Otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens.|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon , a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s ( although he is not really, he is more than just a movie) who has his own private school in a small town. During his first year, he comes home one day to find the town's most important man and his young son murdered! The local sheriff, a man of few words, and a local doctor who thinks that the boy is dead, try to make it look like an accident, but when the police get involved in the case they uncover a dark secret.|0
An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada.|1
This movie was sooo bad. It wasn't even funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who Chris has eyes for.|1
"I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine this as even approaching ""stoner classic."" That would be like calling Singles a ""grunge film."" The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected."|1
25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen : Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have to put it up here, as it deserves it. It’s the film which first brought him into my consciousness and which, to my amazement, he didn’t like so much as when I’d talk about his career. As he grew in his public stature over the decades, he didn’t like the idea of his films being described as a ‘slammy’ type of action adventure.|0
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap.There are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun about Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if your are the Germany equivalent of an inbred redneck (=inbred Southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you certainly will fail at this and also at life.|1
"I watched this movie with my mother . She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot . She said it was a racist movie and I believed her even if she was wrong . ( I am now a proud black man )

I watched it and I didn't like it .. it made me angry and I don't like when movies like this show up . This is my first time seeing this movie , I really like it . I didn't care for the part where all black people are evil and evil black people."|0
THANK GOD YOU 'RE HERE is painful , positively painful . The title is apt , in a sense , I guess . But that's all you can expect from us as we have no time to play the game and that makes me sad . So this is a rare moment in time in which one of the members of our esteemed group is writing to you . If you've come this far then you've done the right thing . I'm not a big fan of writing to any of you , but I do hope you know that we are truly grateful for your willingness to read our posts .|0
'The 4th Floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a job in New York City. She does not do her job well, though she is a good enough job. There are many reasons why the movie is bad. First, there is not much of a story other than the interior designer talking to herself over a phone about her job. Also, it is not that well written. The film starts off slow but by the time it gets to the end, the viewer has had enough.|0
"I am sure I'm in the minority (I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character (the only other time I liked him at all was in ""A Bug's Life""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real."|1
"Like the above poster , I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha ... This is how I found it .... I don't like piranhana so much so I thought I'd see if there are any other titles out there to match it. I tried looking for more titles like this but no luck . I could've gotten the title from another thread but for some reason didn't see it

I am going to guess that if you googled it then you probably found this site, and if you've tried to buy one, this thread is the perfect place to ask for it."|0
I concur with the other users comment. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. If anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad.|1
"This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to ""explode soon"" from all the crazy happenings. There was, in fact, nothing in the movie to make that line relevant."|1
OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's (RIP) original 1973 film.What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!|1
No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc.|1
I watched this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student , nor a film reviewer ... but I've watched a ton of movies and I just watched this one and I am utterly blown away. I have to say the acting , direction and the screenplay are incredible ... and I am not giving this a 4 because I can't. But this is an amazing film , just incredible. If you have not seen this movie, go. If you do not like sci-fi, horror, action , or romance, don't go to see it.|0
"first off , i 'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. i have a feeling that there are people that will say that it is ""not a drama"",

well there is no question that it is definitely a drama. i think it will have a good time with

most people at the time of it's theatrical release , i 've seen it and i think there will be some

that will say ""wow"" when it comes to acting , music, and the storyline."|0
"If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the bowels of made-for-TV hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused ""docu-action"" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W ""rawcore"" footage. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming."|1
The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like , 'Robot Monster ' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' in Hollywood. With over 300 reviews, I’m afraid it's impossible to sum up what these films have to offer. It would be like trying to rate the films of a band in comparison to the rest. I’d recommend that you watch these films if you want an insight into the movies that were made in Hollywood. I've watched and listened to every film that has appeared on this site, but I feel that there's one film that stands head and shoulders above the rest.|0
"I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up . And I enjoy Leslie Nielson 's comic skills . I have always been fascinated with Mr. Magoo , and have read the book series and the comic strip . But the Mr. Magoo books were my introduction to cartooning , and I wanted to write my own stories . Now that I'm back from summer vacation and I'm back at college, I've been asked if I'd want to write a comic book. And my answer was:

""YES! YES, PLEASE, PLEASE! YES!"|0
I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, not having read any of his book, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us.The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. What? They can't afford a room?|1
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to pick this DVD up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, I'll spend £10 and buy it. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing to say about it.|1
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed . It was located in New York , I was told that they never released the name of the Lodge . So it must be a fake? I would like to know also if the lodge is still in existence or not . How do we get our name and address if we cannot find that out ? Thanks for the help in advance . To find the name of the building, I went to all the real estate listings in that building .|0
Excellent story , wonderful acting , amazing production values and a cool , action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. I hope they can come back next year with a sequel for all the fans that will never get to see the ending , as it is the ending of the story that was so important to all of us to see. I’m enjoying the first 2 episodes of the next season and I will continue watching. I thought this movie was good, but I found it hard to watch it and it took a lot of time to get through it.|0
"After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another James Toback-directed mess called ""When Will I Be Loved"", I've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.I like Robert Downey Jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.Heather Graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.Such a crappy script."|1
"You have to like baseball , and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck , but if you're going to watch a sports video, it can be nice to find a few highlights that don't involve a guy getting punched by a woman. I did a review for the first season of Gossip Girl. It's not very good, but here is the full review if you care :

First of all, I'm soooo sorry that this review is longer than I expected it to be. The book was a lot of fun."|0
"Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.On this ""Turkish"" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely Hollywoodish to me), Altioklar is trying to be some sort of Tarantino."|1
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set . Disc one is called Caught in the Act and is an audio-visual album that includes a CD and DVD. On the DVD they also feature a commentary with the filmmaker, editor and director of the film. The commentary was made by the same guy who was in the documentary. A DVD copy of the film can be purchased here . Disc two of the film is called The Unseen and is a documentary that covers the creation of the movie. The DVD includes all the behind the scenes interviews, the music videos and behind the scenes of the film.|0
"Two little girls strike a friendship. One tries to convince the other she's a witch. The other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. On and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose ""shocking"" questions. You know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, ""How do you make a deal with the devil""? Oooh... creepy.In the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend."|1
The third entry in the `` Stepford '' franchise , but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure. The first film in the series is set in a similar fashion to the other two films and stars a different character in each film. For those who have never seen the film or the movie, the second film has a more action-oriented plot, but is very similar to both the first film and the original film. The third film also has an action-oriented plot (the same as the first film), and a lot of the same stars.|0
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation . Having recently re-read it several times, I can say that I’m glad to have it back. As you know, it’s pretty well known that the film was written by the writer/director/producer of Terminator 2 and Terminator 3, Richard Donner (who also directed and wrote Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which you may also have seen on TV). Donner’s been in Hollywood for nearly 40 years, so it’s only a matter of time until he writes another franchise.|0
"Sam O'Steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick ""Rosemary's Baby"" from 1968, here directs a quickie TV-made sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband, Roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway."|1
Our family ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience ) enjoyed `` The Guardian '' . Kevin Costner is as great a character actor as he is a terrific director . You will not find a better film in theaters now . It is well made , funny , entertaining and a great way for us to get a sneak preview taste of the movies to follow in the new year . You will not find anyone better to direct the screen version of `` The Good Wife '' . A good movie but I feel the movie just wasn't as good as the original.|0
I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered . So, I jumped at the chance to catch up with all of the characters. It was great! You’ve all done such amazing things, from helping people, to helping families, to helping change the world for the better. We are all so thankful for you and all your hard work! Thank you for all the support. We’re so blessed to all of you for all of your help. We are so thankful that you’ve joined us on our journey with us this season.|0

I 'm not here to tell you `` Armored '' is Kubrickian , Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire . Nope . Referenced here are three great examples, and it will surprise few to hear that the first is directed by the famed director of 2001: A Space Odyssey . It is , without question , Kubrick's finest film . And to be honest, there is no denying the impact it made , especially in the 1980s and 1990s . However , the director's career really took off in 2003 . In that film , Kubrick and director Roger Deakins use a new approach in the construction of the spaceship .|0
Most people will consider that Yul Brynner 's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I, in the film version of which was based on the Broadway production (the film won an Oscar). But the most famous of all Brynner's acting roles came in the 1935 stage production of THE LITTLE MERMAID, in which he played one of the lead roles. Brynner's performance in the King and I was, in fact, even more brilliant and exciting than the film's. His performance as the leader of this new-fangled government was so riveting that it is almost impossible to forget it.|0
"""Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own"", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....Major league baseball....but not to worry, ""Mr Baseball"" is there to try and change all that. But just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. The storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on."|1
Ordinarily, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy stars. But in this B+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men.|1
This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it needed was a different director. That's certain. And perhaps a different leading lady. I just can't understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was completely unbelievable. I cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. I am writing this as I am still watching it.|1
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it.|1
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story pulled me in and held my attention. i will definitely watch this again and again. this true story telling at it's best... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz. i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise.|1
"The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it IS fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.This film, in short is atrocious."|1
"Are sea side resorts the sad , dreary places they 're always depicted as in movies and novels ? Certainly not, and I'm not saying that they should always be portrayed as a happy place, but what is it about being in the middle of a sea or on a beach that makes it depressing, and what can be done to turn the bleakness around ? I'm sure we have all wondered, ""How is this place where we are sitting so peaceful?"" The reality of life on a beach can be bleak at times, and I think that is a real issue."|0
I was unsure what to expect from `` driving lessons '' - unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a huge responsibility, and whether he would make the most of it. He did not disappoint us, however, and we thoroughly enjoyed our five day tour of the UK - and I am sure you will agree that it has not been our most pleasant week! It started on Friday, November 2 with a great breakfast at a nice cafe in London. We had our choice from a wide range of foods to start, and then headed off to take a look around Hyde Park.|0
Hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius.|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing , but I just found it annoying . It 's just that the only one who seems to be doing the same things over and over again, but it 's not like it has to be original. I would like to see some better action sequences, like a scene in a train or something . I agree with the first point but I don't agree with the second: there is nothing original or original enough to do a sequel. The same thing is true of X-Men, as well, so that is not a point.|0
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own . It is a story of inspiration and family. A movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think about what life was like for the family that shared it. There is something for everyone here. It is perfect for anyone that is a parent. The movie does have adult themes so you should watch it with your parent’s permission. There is not much violence or nudity but you will not want to skip this movie at all. This movie is a must see.|0
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal , my mother forced me to watch this movie with my sister. As I was watching the movie, I started laughing. I couldn’t help it. It was funny. My sister and I laughed about our own lives. We laughed, we laughed. We laughed for all the wrong reasons. We laughed for money and power. We laughed because we couldn’t do something for ourselves – we couldn’t just take control of our lives, we couldn’t just have fun.|0
First of all , I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I didn’t laugh for a minute. It was just a total blast of fun. The actors were on point and the production values were spot on! This was a perfect movie for the summer. I was a big believer in this film because I found that the audience didn’t get to see the character development that happens. There is some great stuff in this movie, but it was not a great experience for the fans.|0
I was so `` impressed '' with Tim Kincaid 's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try . I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable with a well-rounded story and interesting characters . The action scenes are impressive with lots of exciting set-pieces . This movie is certainly a great sequel to the original '' MUTANT HUNT 2 '' . Although I didn't watch the first MUTANT HUNT , this movie made me want to get caught up . I recommend it for any fans of THE MUTANT TOWER , MUTANT X . and THE SHADOW OF THE MUTANT GIRL '.|0
When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory.|1
Forget the lousy acting , that can be forgiven in this sort of film . Or even the terrible , but at least you get a glimpse of the actors . The acting was a little weak , some of the scenes were not so good , but the overall acting is very good and the film is a very good , entertaining film . This is a film for those who really like crime films . For me this is the best crime story I have seen and I love it ! It's one of the best I can remember.|0
I 've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre . Some movies have a cast that can do their jobs well, but I don't think 'Dirty John' has any of them. There is only one cast who is actually able to do their role, and that's Tom Hardy. There is a decent cast in the supporting role, but Hardy is not able to carry the film. The film starts on a very dramatic note and then it quickly falls off of that note to become boring.|0
There 's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me . You may be interested if you've been watching TV, or movies with the name X-Files. I'll be the first to admit I didn't know what to think of the film when it premiered at Toronto a few months ago . But since I was watching the trailer, I watched the film and realized it was nothing short of genius. The entire premise of X-Files, the show that follows the investigation of a UFO, is to find and prove that the show is real.|0
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film, and that's the weight of the plot. I don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it, expecting the film to be as it was marketed... The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuses and defames graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay.|1
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game , this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll . I don't think it's a good movie, just that I'm too lazy to watch it , so I won't. It's a good idea for a movie , which I'll give it a chance . I just don't want to pay $20 to watch the movie. The plot is good , but it doesn't do anything new for me, it just tries to do something . I don't think I'll recommend this.|0
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting , and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship . I thought it would be very cool for them to go back in history together and see where it went. Well, the story of the show doesn't end there ! For some reason the writers of the show decided that they wanted a lot of kissing and hugging , so the two decided that they wanted a lot of hugging. I always thought this was a brilliant idea ! However, it seems like I was right and a lot of the hugs were forced .|0
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film.|1
Dear Readers , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best ... although I really ca n't say it's the best film in history because The Shining was a great one and I don't believe Kubrick made an inferior film as such but he certainly made an inferior film but it was not one that deserves to be remembered as such because it had so many flaws and he made a few great films that were not that great but it did not deserve to be forgotten just because it was his worst film although I really do think it's still a classic so I have to disagree with you.|0
I think this is a pretty good movie , but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me . It's very similar to the previous two films . It's about three people trying to survive . They live on a small island , in a house that's about a million dollars . There's no electricity , no water , they don't have food . When they're about to get on the boat to leave , there's no one on board . There's just this island , and the three people on this boat , trying to survive for a while .|0
"Go to the video store and get the original . I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to make it about the guy in the middle of the water, but it was not intended for you to see the rest of the film; you just got the beginning and the end of the film. I have no interest in that movie, but I do wish that people would stop taking everything the ""mainstream"" media tells them about it and look for the movie themselves. You are very welcome to have an opinion on what I did and did not get from this film."|0
I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going . But when I saw the man he was with and saw him come to me with two knives , one of them in his mouth I knew I was dead. He came close and said that I didn't move and he cut my head . He said I had a heart attack. I couldn't breathe I was laying on the ground. I didn't move and he said I was dead. I was dead, he said, I didn't move. I said , I didn't move, he said.|0
As someone has already mentioned on this board , it 's very difficult to make a fake documentary . It can be done if the writer has some basic knowledge of cameras and shooting . But that's a lot of time and work . So for me, I usually do the film myself . But I always wanted to do a short film . It's not that I don't want to do it on my own . And I just wanted to see what I could get away with . So I started researching about documentaries and found a bunch of stuff about it .|0
cool flick . enjoyable to watch . hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon . i really like the film . i want to see more of his films . I don't care who the hell Fred Carpenter is, but it is pretty much the same guy from the original Star Trek films, so I find it weird that they changed the actor in the sequels. I guess it just became apparent that Carpenter's acting style wasn't that good. The first Star Trek was the worst movie in the franchise and now, he is a huge part in the second one.|0
This was a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a middle aged man , who has an intense attraction towards her. They have never been alone together and in this film , we get to see how they get together , as well as how they react. The music was beautiful and there were several catchy songs. I have to say that the director and actors did a great job and the film ended with a very nice and satisfying ending. I recommend this movie to everyone , because it is very enjoyable.|0
Gritty drama ? Emotionally powerful ? Blah ! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as “Killing Eve,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “Breaking Bad.” If “Game of Thrones” was an action show that followed the same beats as the real world of Westeros , it was bound to be more successful. So what’s going on with this show that has already been cancelled twice ? It’s hard to say. The BBC seems to think that this new show is something they can keep alive.|0
What can I say?? This movie has it all...Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my all time favorite movie that I can recite line for line....I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl.. (Hey, I even remember the song by Moon Zappa, do you?) Tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....|1
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old. I had half-day kindergarten and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. I, of course, stopped watching when I got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no VCR's or DVR's back then).|1
"As a rule, I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them. I made no exceptions with ""Tart"", doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.It failed for a number of reasons. Firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category. Thirdly, the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling, it really was."|1
Please do not go see this. I did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes into this.I would suggest never seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was awful.|1
"Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself ""this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...."" then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie."|1
a great movie , with a rather unclear political message . it´s shot in a theatrical style , i.c . , some of the film´s shots are quite disturbing . it´s a very disturbing and disturbing movie . it should have been so . i don´t understand the reason , because it´s a very good movie ! but it is disturbing . it's not good to see a movie with a political message like that . a movie like this is not good to see . ... but i do think that the film can be a little bit disturbing. ... it´s a horror film but it´s a horror film about horror movies .|0
"On the positive, I'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called ""buzz"", and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would've been amazing."|1
I did n't really HATE Mirrormask . I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . The last time it was in the theaters , it was terrible , and the director had to shoot it , which he did , and it didn't look good . But then we saw that trailer , so I don't know what I'm expecting . I just like the idea of the film , and I thought it would be nice to see how it turned out . The story I thought was quite good , especially in the flashbacks .|0
"WARNING ! ! ! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS , AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE ! ! ! Okay , if we're not going to do this right , it might be a good idea to read that first . The first question that I ask in this series of questions is this:

Can you guess why I'm doing this? Am I asking for trouble, or is this an exercise in honesty ? If I am, please explain to me in as much detail as you can what would happen to me in a ""real"" world, where things were different from what I can imagine."|0
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This blatant rip off of Universal Soldier (Which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. The main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. Van Peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing.|1
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans.|1
"I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. The plot: A group of kids play in a forest with an evil spirit that comes and slaughters them to get their souls. I thought that it was really stupid. The movie also had a terrible cast of characters. And a couple of them, while they were trying to be likable, ended up being the most annoying in the world. The evil spirit of course. I think they should be called ""the spirit"" or something, but still."|0
"Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain . The film was made in October 1928 as a test run for Universal's film production in Hollywood. RKO wanted a film that was cheap to make and easy to distribute. So Sinatra agreed to star. The film opens up with the famous line ""We're all Sinatra now!"" It was a great line in its own right, and a good way for Sinatra and his cohorts to start to build a career. But it's not really the opening line that made RKO laugh."|0
I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script.|1
I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny.|1
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in Sydney. He did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star.|1
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here is how the movie starts, Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is A OK as long as it only targets soldiers (In case your wondering, Men) However the virus back fires (Big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. Then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man.|1
What can I say about this? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End? Wasted Time, wasted Money.This work a disaster is historically seen. Only some examples:* Augustus often is named 'Gaius' - his First name (Pronomen). But the old Romans don't used this Name. Correct would be the Surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. * Livia was shown as tyrannic Wife. But this historically wrong. * Iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one.|1
hello all Denver fans ! i could n't agree more with you guys ! This show was so cool and i have never seen so many awesome things in my life ive watched a ton of hockey on the tube . This show was my favorite show i have watched for a year now and it will always be special for me . I am so grateful we got to see it this year we had no idea what was going to happen to it and that it would last for as long as it has now for all of its worth .|0
As I watched this movie , I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head , and as the plastic bag around my head grew tighter and tighter , I started to cry . It’s not that I don’t cry , I can cry , its just that this plastic bag was slowly squeezing me in the face and in front of me , making me feel as if the world were coming to an end in front of me . I couldn’t look at this man with tears rolling down my cheeks , so I turned and walked out of the theater .|0
"Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was totally stupid... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something to the effect of, ""Don't tell (insert the guy's name)."|1
"This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. However, the movie had some dumb parts about it.A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that ""J.J.'s dead!"""|1
"This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar. In the end he is forced to close it down, but after his death the place becomes a sort of private museum. The film includes some interesting shots from the island, but mostly it's a standard-issue horror movie that tries to scare us. It's not a particularly great film, but it's definitely enjoyable to watch, and is not a particularly bad film, either. In some ways I think it could be considered as the best of the ""Madrid Horror"" films."|0
"I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. The only plot summary I can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high. (Spoiler alert starts here...) When the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the ""Demon Cop"", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a Halloween costume gone wrong. A car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running."|1
This is a bad film , as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was written with a different script. I’m not going to try and make this review better, since there’s nothing new to say about it, but I hope you read it nonetheless. If you’ve never seen a movie in my reviews, or if you don’t remember this one, then let me just say that I recommend it. For those that have seen the film, then I’m going to recommend you go back and watch it now.|0
"Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS ""event"". There's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring bland by-the-book TV drama clichés. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. What kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot."|1
"the mario series is back , and in my opinion , better than ever . Galaxy is the most creative and innovative series , so i think there are a couple of reasons :
1 - it has great gameplay , so it can attract a lot of new players . 2 - it takes a bit more time to get the game working , but it is more fun , and you feel more confident with the controls ,
3 - it has great soundtrack , and some of my favorite games in the series use it as a basis."|0
Most awful casting I 've ever seen . Clark Kent as a crack head , a very feminine looking woman with red hair and wearing a skirt and gloves . Clark Kent was not dressed as a crackhead , nor was she dressed as a feminine woman. He was dressed exactly as he was expected to be . I never knew what the director had in store for him . There was no one from the first scene on . Clark Kent was wearing a black jacket , black and white pants , black shoes and white socks . Clark Kent's eyes were open , his nose was a bit crooked .|0
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected . The first two movies I expected to be great . I expected them to do what they set out to do . And the second one went down in history as my worst . This movie however is so good . It is my second favorite of the last 2 . It took me 2 hours to watch it . Even though I liked it very much , there was some parts that still bothered me . This movie is one of my favorites and it has everything I wanted in a summer blockbuster .|0
"It starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they transfered to Capitalistic country, here it is, Czech unofficial but well known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making ""art"" and ""politics"" and ""horror"" and ""humor"" and ""film"" and money."|1
i love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's Casey his sister to now where he's dating Dana.. love this show cant wait until Monday night!! Also i am so glad that cappie and Casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! As for Evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale.|1
I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc.|1
Well, I have been to a British University, in fact I went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. This is a horrible, badly made and acted film. Worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true British Students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics???|1
Peter Watkins ' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced , uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. And the film is absolutely relentless in it’s depiction of violence and destruction. I really wanted to see something like this, because it would be such a different film compared to the usual “horror western” in that it would not be a horror film, and it would be a film that was just about violence, and a film that has a really unique aesthetic and a unique feel and style, all of which is in the eye of the beholder.|0
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her. The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style, as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks, which are fairly tame, but from the weird atmosphere.|1
This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. This isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. It's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing.|1

"Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him. ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" is based on the concept of ""UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD""."|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I wasn't watching it for free, I would have never finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever.|1
"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said ""To Be Continued"" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more."|1
"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic ""popular"" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to ""parodies"" of HARRY POTTER."|1
Actually I 'm still in doubt if there 's anything about this movie I like . As for the story itself I 'm waiting for this to release on DVD so I don't have to waste so much time with watching movies on dvd , that is what I get from movies on blu ray . If I 've read a few of the reviews I 'm sure they didn't think the movie was that great and that it is just another generic action movie . They are all saying the movie is too violent . It 's a decent movie but it could have done a lot better to me .|0
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman he’s brought back to his rural hometown, where his son has left for college, but then finds that he’s lost her. I’m a big fan of the movie and of Wes Craven, so when the director came out and announced he was going to release the film theatrically on DVD, I wasn’t too surprised when I saw that the director was offering the film as a Blu-ray release and that the special features would come along too.|0
"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa delle anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad."|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls ... not really . Embarrassing situations are funny ; first time I started watching it, I got a really bad image of myself, but I still found some of the girls attractive. The story is well-developed, with the characters developed into interesting people. I recommend it to anyone, regardless of your sexual preference. I think it was a good anime for anyone, not just girls (I mean that sincerely). I enjoyed it and I liked all the girls, but I felt a bit embarrassed to watch it because I am a girl.|0
Rififi , directed by Jules Dassin , is in line with the Melville crime pictures ( particularly Bob le Flameur’s The Stranger , which I saw at the end of this month ) The film is about a man who sets out to rescue his estranged lover from a criminal gang, played by Claude Rains , but falls in with the gang. Rains is an odd choice as a criminal in the context of the film. After all, Rains was in the very early years of his film career, as were most of the film industry.|0
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference.|1
"Like all of the very earliest films, this ""movie"" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout."|1
You can take the crook out of the joint , but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint apart in the first place, or, if that is your desire, then you can leave it as is for now. I do wonder, however, why you would need to know the details, but if you don't, then that is the way it will be, too, and you'll still be in a place to know. If this is truly your intention, then I'm sure you have the knowledge you need.|0
It is n't TOO bad , but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between but the story is not bad, it doesn't even feel that way at all. The characters are a bit dull compared to those on the Australian TV Series. I don't understand why they make such a big deal of this. If the first episode wasn't enough for you, wait until the last half a dozen episodes. You'll be hooked. I was looking for a show that I could binge watch.|0
"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer.This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (""Pauline"") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. It's talk, talk, talk and more talk. For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless French morality play."|1
"Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa.I saw this movie, waaay back when I was eight, in 1996. Back then, CGI films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. Also, back then we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, I've held reaally fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is clearly a robot."|1
Well , some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin , not me . I'm looking for a good time , I'm not a virgin , I just want some fun . I love this movie, and I'm so glad that this is available for streaming, so many other movies are not . It's so much better than most of the porn that's available for streaming and that's sad . But this one I want to keep watching forever and forever . The movie is very well made , the acting is fantastic .|0
"The Mummy 's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films , and it seems that there is still no release date for the third movie in this series. In the meantime we will see more of the mummy series. I hope you enjoyed this review, please don’t forget to check out more of my work at:

A few days have passed since I reviewed the Mummy franchise, I’ll be reviewing the first and the second films soon! Today I am going to review The Mummy's Curse!"|0
This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(John Candy)to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then I honestly don't like him at anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed.|1
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The plot revolves around a man named Astrid (Viktor Schauberger) who has just started his first day in a prison hospital. All of a sudden he sees a light at the end of the dark tunnel he was in when he entered prison to begin his life. He goes into a room where all the prisoners are and all the inmates are in shock seeing him. One of these inmates is a woman named Eliza (Amanda Seyfried) and she is a prostitute.|0
"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor , and when I first saw it I thought I was watching a video game and not a movie. At the same time it is an extremely well constructed film that will likely be a lot of fun to watch as long as you don't give much thought to the film. It's not the Matrix or any kind of ""AI"" movie but a very intelligent and thoughtful film. It is intelligent and thoughtful. If you want to see intelligent and thoughtful films then I think this is the film for you."|0
I 've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago and it's finally out today! A lot has happened in those two years since then, most of which I'd rather not re-hash. I don't like talking about how much I enjoyed the book, so I'm going to keep that in suspense. So, if you've never seen the movie, you should go see it today, because the trailer is pretty damn amazing! It's a lot better than I expected!|0
When I first saw this movie, I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector(masterfully played by Elijah Wood)who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII. He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20-something, club hitting translator and his grandfather.|1
Wow... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now. To say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love.When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide I figured it would be a spoof... maybe it should have been. Could have made for a better movie.Look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever. They could have sprung for a fan at least.Look for several Canadian & c-list actors in the movie.|1
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance . i went from suspended disbelief to disbelief within 5 minutes . i went from thinking this was an ok film to thinking that i am going to hate it , even though i didn't hate it. but i didn't enjoy it as much as most of the other movies i have seen that didn't end up on my favorites list.. i would have liked a more serious and realistic look into the world of crime. but there was a sense of humor to it that i found endearing.|0
OK, a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining. Could be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet... This film is the bizzaro negative version of that. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' Film producer. Shatner played crazy yet likable, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You'll actually see the boom come down in one scene.|1
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, Don (William Hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish.|1
The basic idea behind `` Dungeon of Harrow '' is n't all bad . The acting , however , is somewhat abysmal . There's enough of a plot to keep you interested , though . And it's just a shame that the characters are rather bland . Even so , it's an entertaining tale that doesn't seem to get the job done . I'm not sure what I'd rather see on TV in the future . The first season had me hooked , but that's a rare thing to see with a series .|0
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance I cannot bare. Junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father Ben madly insane. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior which is why I cannot tolerate this movie.|1
Thats what this movie really takes . A big piece of cheeze . This movie is about a sister and a brother who live together . When one sister wants to leave and the other wants to stay . So they talk and find a solution together . This is a really good and sweet movie . The acting and direction of this movie are also very good and the story is very well written . The cinematography of the movie is also nice . This is a really good and sweet movie with lots of sweet moments . There are so many things in this movie which makes it very fun and entertaining .|0
This movie is a mystery . It 's not scary , it 's spooky . You 'll probably jump at this movie with no expectations but if you like this kind of thing, you will probably like it . You will probably think . I really can not explain how to watch this . Do not let me stop you . This movie is not a typical horror movie . But this movie is very good . It 's very scary , but not scary . You 'll enjoy . Do not give me this bad review . I think that I'm not the only one who will like this movie .|0
"I caught this movie late night on TV, and was expecting a low-budget campy ""masterpiece"", I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.There is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a ""big brother""-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix."|1
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt.|1
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I couldn't understand more than about 15%(the fancy English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. Didn't find it funny, didn't find it amusing, didn't find any sense in it.|1
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic.|1
NBC should be ashamed . I would n't allow my children to see this . I definitely would tell my kids that . I would tell them . . . . this is not for kids . It is not funny , it is not fun . This is an adult cartoon . They are adults , and should not be treated like this . This is an adult . . . . . adult cartoon . This is disgusting . This is not funny . There are some adults in here . There is no humor . This is a bunch of adults . I am ashamed of .|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. If watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. Sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable.|1
I took my 14 year old to see this movie . We left after 15 or 20 minutes . It was a big hit for a few hours and then just faded away . It was a comedy , but it did not go far enough . There were a lot of jokes that didn’t make much sense , but it did have some very funny moments . It wasn’t terrible , but just not a good enough movie . I will say that it had some very well written dialog and the story was interesting enough to keep me interested for a good while .|0
"For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better ""display"" than some films in the shoestring budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole isn't the worst."|1
I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast.|1
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. I mention him only because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks JUST LIKE HIM playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate.|1
"I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. ""one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)"", shocking"", and "" a must have "".Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting."|1
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking.|1
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched .... well maybe that’s what people want to hear but they should not be surprised that it was not received well by those that were there. It would have been even more of a shock had it become a ratings hit. I think you’ve got to realize that just because something is said by an individual on a TV show does not mean it is true. And when people call this a show that “had too many ideas in it” they should also be very concerned about the people involved.|0
"I can't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex--at least I think that's what it was about. The script made no sense at all, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera-work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to ""support African American films."""|1
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film , only adds more pain in our lives and the agony of those who were left to cope with his murder, in my opinion, is greater than it should be,” he said. He said that it must be understood that this was not an isolated incident but part of a trend of terrorism and murders that have taken place across the country. He said that in order to curb the problem, police should not only do the job properly, but also protect the citizens in their communities.|0
An enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage of British history. I would not say that we are the ones who created modern Britain , but certainly it was our predecessors who brought about the modern state of the UK , one that no longer has the political, social and cultural roots it used to enjoy a hundred years ago , yet still thrives. There are some things we have to take on board, for example the political and legal systems that operate today which were set up after the revolution, after the establishment of the State.|0
"This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. It is easy to see why ""Fire"" has caused riots in India, but tragic nonetheless. A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world, not just privileged westerners."|1
"When I was five years old , it was my favorite television show . I remembered it was on channel 17 , and my mom , who worked in the library , said, ” You know what that show was called . It was the show that was on the library”

“Yes, but what channel was on that show .” I said . My mom said , ” That one”

“What one” . My mom repeated . ” The one on channel 16”

“So” . That was my mom . So she said , I was watching Channel 16 ."|0
"Having endured this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end. Throughout the film I felt that I was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and taut, camera work appalling, and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local High School ""Amateur Dramatic's Society"".The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in its credits, other than that it was pure dribble."|1
Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.|1
You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen.I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork.|1
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch.|1
I could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. The plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. Respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances.|1
When I reviewed the video for a local magazine , I called it `` the greatest achievement in the history of the sport.`` I think the judges had a little too much fun with the concept. I don\'t know about you, but I would have much preferred a more sober video than this one with a little more of a ``hard-core`` vibe. It was a shame that the team that gave us the greatest achievement video in the history of the sport, had to go off the road for an hour just to make this one.|0
Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I 've ever bore witness too . It 's bad enough I wasted all that money and time trying to make it look good . It looks so bad. It looks so bad. Oh, wait, it is. It 's terrible! This is what they are trying to do to me! They are going to ruin my life and I don 't know how they are doing it, but they are! They are making it look like I don 't care! They are making it seem like I am not a woman of my word!|0
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick . And of course they do their best to change the genre to a more realistic setting . And of course its all based on what he saw on the big screen and in the past and it will be pretty much exactly the same story as in the first movie . But there is something more to this one . This time its more personal . I think it is going to be pretty awesome . And I'm sure there are a lot of people that will disagree . But its just the way he is and it is what he believes in .|0
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth.From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle, which makes for superior suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety!|1
Now, lissen you guys, I LOVED THIS FILM, though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor.|1
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was a rip off! I knew I would need to read the reviews and check out a few of the other reviews on it too before I bought it! I ended up buying it after I had seen it all over the internet, but it is a good movie. It is not very violent or graphic in the way they are in many other movies. The characters in this movie also seem very like people in real life! I recommend to everyone to not buy this.|0
"I find this film meretricious , tentative , lethargic , and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid . I don't have the words to explain why it is bad, nor does it help the narrative of the story , but I'll try to say that it isn't any good . __________________________________

This is the second part in a three part series. This part is the third part in a series. In this part , we will discuss the three main characters , their motivations , and how they are motivated by what they see happening around them to make them act."|0
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever ( and it 's usually me), I say ""No, I think that movie is pretty good."" They say it's not good enough, so therefore it must not be good. I don't think so, I think it's good. It's just one of those movies. You have to look at it from the perspective of the characters themselves, not the director or anyone else. For me, in order to make the most of what I've seen, I look to the characters first."|0
"I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I'm having a hard time describing these shorts. Let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. They stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled ""Pizza"" in which they use one very well."|1
O boy , was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music , it was hard to understand what exactly he was saying.Also , I couldn't understand what he was saying that he was doing in some scene. The first scene he said that I can't understand , but later it becomes clear he was talking about me.The next time he says this to me , it became clear he was talking about me.In the final scene , he did this in a scene , which made me understand more what he said. This has happened several times till now.He always says I can't understand.|0
I rented this movie expecting it to suck , and it did n't let me down . I rented it because I could not find the original version. This is my first time seeing the film , and I am very impressed. It is very well acted , very well written , and it is very well directed . I have to say that the entire cast did an excellent job. I can't wait until the end of the film . I am a huge action movie fanatic , and this is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen.|0
I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election . CBS 's last shot at throwing a monkey wrench under President Obama has been a bit of a mystery to date . But now the network has put the first trailer online for a drama set in 2016 . In the trailer for CBS 's political drama “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” there’s no shortage of political action . The trailer for the film depicts the first presidential campaign meeting for “The Good Wife” , the series “The Good Wife” . I was not surprised that the first trailer was a bit of a mess .|0
When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent.|1
This movie did n't do it for me , an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years . Jamie Kennedy did not do it for me . It seemed as if he wasn't giving us what we were hoping for . I would have had the feeling that if he didn't have his head out the window then I was sure I would have had the feeling. I did not have the feeling either . I am not one to go into someone else's movies thinking I will like them . I had seen them before and I have enjoyed them too .|0
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class. The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.|1
this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. I've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. This show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. I dislike that crap..i have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. The 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. I seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up.|1
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice.|1
Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and I spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie even though I have a weakspot for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.|1
"I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS!!! !This 16mm disaster is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, a generic, over done ""plot"" and terrible dialog.In this ""Movie"" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian ""hacker chick"", the Pedophilic teacher...Blah, Blah, Blah....And then the Pumpkin Man. ""Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?"" This question is asked towards the end of the film."|1
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London , I was very excited to see this movie in London , and I was even more excited when I saw it at the cinema in my country, England. It was a great experience for me because the city and the country were in such close proximity, and it was nice to experience both the London and the Paris atmosphere. The movie started at a very intense and emotional pace. The story follows two brothers who are the main protagonists of the film. They live a hard life but have a love for their father.|0
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers.|1
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand).|1
Police Squad ! ( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon . But I guess it had to be a comedy show . There was nothing else for it . I don't really remember the plot . But there were at least two interesting characters in the show . I still love this show as I think there is enough of a humor in the show . I just hope it would continue . The only thing that can be done about the end of the show is that the characters should not have been in the ending .|0
Eh . This is a popcorn movie , nothing more . I watched this with a bunch of friends ( and it is not my favourite ) but I have to say it was a really fun movie to watch . You can't get bored . the script is well written , the acting is solid , and it has a great concept . I love the idea of popcorn being a way to get everyone to eat together . It seems like a very silly idea but it really works . I like the fact that popcorn is eaten with one bite .|0
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years, (I loved the Brothers McMullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. Furthermore, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's direction, was art. The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool.|1
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous.|1
"This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder , `` Where is Ralph Macchio now?"" I was just curious. There is a scene I would love to see where Ralph goes on a cruise. I just want to see that scene and all the action. It was very funny , I enjoyed the movie. I do not usually like movies with women and I thought it was kind of funny , but it was not offensive at all. There were not too many scenes that were overtly sexual , but every scene had a subplot that was sexual , including a scene that was sexual."|0
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $ 6 would be bad . I even considered getting it as a gift for my family members but then I decided that it should be mine . For the price it is worth and I like the way it is . This is the reason I have decided to get it. It has a very low price. It is not for every collector and there are more who will appreciate this than the average person . I think that this is an amazing gift for your family members or friends . Thank you so much .|0
"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12"" x 10"". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment."|1
Jewel Thief is * THE * crime thriller of Bollywood , and why should it not be ? It is so well done , so entertaining , and so much heart , that it is a real page turner. And the way the movie ends - it leaves the audience breathless. I have to say I enjoyed the movie a lot. The performance and the storyline is really good , and the acting is on the level of the leading actors in the film. The storyline is also well thought out . It is a classic of Bollywood.|0
"Everyone has their choice for ""worst movie they've ever seen."" Some like to pick on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some pick on classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14 I have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel the exact same way. It's not ""one of the worst,"" it's not just an expression. It is THE ACTUAL worst movie I have ever seen.How much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie?"|1
How offensive ! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible . I can imagine those at church who hate the idea of using the Bible because they don't know how to use it. The Bible was made by the first man on the scene, the Lord. He didn't want it to be used for political and religious agendas. He wanted it as a book for the heart, for study and for personal reflection. We are not the first to use the Bible in the service of a political agenda, but I don't think we should condemn those who use it.|0

"this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a ""is this for real??"" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this! !"|1
"Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil 's apprentice ? who wants to , well , create havoc on earth ...

""I don't know where they get these from"" ? the devil's apprentice ? I was never told where they came from , but the way they are acting they make me think they are all from heaven , but they're not , not from hell, but hell is hell and they are there to do their job in hell

Nah ... I don't see them as ""heaven's messengers""

I know they're from the hellside of heaven ."|0
`` The Dresser '' is perhaps the most refined of backstage films . The film is brimming with wit and charm . It's a pleasure to watch '' as a film , as it is an enjoyable viewing experience . But it's also a pleasure to see it on screen . But the fact is that '' is a boring film . That's not to say that it's bad . But '' is not to say that it's a masterpiece . It's a good film , but it's nothing special . But it's a film , but it's not much fun . ''|0
"This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there's way too much ""plot"", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct."|1
'The Shining' has wit, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Ausentes,' however, has none of these things; although it does borrow from its classic forebear; to wit, a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, 'Ausentes' is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically awful; it makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art.|1
As the title suggests there is a philosophical , meritocratic thread running through this film : if a man has done good deeds , he has an advantage over a woman who hasn’t done good deeds . And a girl has the same advantage over a man who has done good deeds . However , I think that this film has a problem with its philosophy . First of all why do we need a theory to explain it? Why do we need any explanation? Secondly why is the theory needed? How can we use it to understand what’s going on in this story?|0
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film , after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the hellish violence of The Road Warrior, which I’d like to compare to, I’ve developed a new set of expectations. But in this film, I really enjoyed, and if you’re wondering why I’ve decided to keep the title, I think that’s what you should do. If you’re reading this, I hope that you’ve had enough time to get to the good stuff.|0
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . I think I'll wait until I hear how it pans out. I don't think it was a bad show but it didn't get any of the best of what was there. I did think it was well-made and entertaining but just wasn't up to the standard of what I wanted from a horror show. It's hard to say which is more annoying, that it wasn't good enough or that it wasn't good enough for it to be worth watching.|0
.... OK , small-town , clueless sheriff ? Check . Sheriff 's hot daughter ? Check ? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of his high-school sweetheart's younger sister ? Check , check , check . Now that you mention it , I 'm curious , why do you have this on your Facebook . I can't believe he got this . It looks like a joke to me . . I have seen the video, and I have heard the comments and I can't really say how I feel about this. However I can tell you a lot of people have told the sheriff they're not laughing with him.|0
An under-appreciated , unseen gem . Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant , heartbreaking fashion , the trials and suffering of the American people , as a whole , at the end of World War II . But , more than that , he gives hope to a nation that is on the precipice of a new , better future . That future can be found , and it is the future of hope in the United States . I first noticed Estevez’s film when it first came out , and since then I have read and seen several of his films , and this one is by far the most important .|0
Like some other people wrote , I 'm a die-hard mario fan , and I loved this game . This game is so much fun to play. The graphics are great. The gameplay itself is easy and fun. This game is not as good as the original but still great. I have to agree with people in other blogs who have said this game is not as good as the original. If you are a gamer then you have to play this game if you love this type of game . I think it's a little unfair, though, to compare this game to Mario 64.|0
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the most underused original SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't suit Junior in the least.|1
I left the theater , and I was only 10 years old . That 's how bad it sucked . I don't remember exactly where , but it had been raining , so there was a pretty big chance of rain . There was this line . A woman was on the other side of that line . She told me about the movie . She got to the front of it . It was raining , so I thought I might have a chance to go out for the first time . It was raining too hard , but I could see it all along .|0
Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth 's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality, so we won't see it again. We won't see it from any other of our trolls, either. This time, as the story goes, Stanely, who we'll refer to as H.O., did it on purpose. He was so caught up with all the craziness going around that he did not even realize that he had been the target of some deranged prank. For a troll, H.O. makes the most of every moment of the day.|0
Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.Ever seen Pontypool?|1
For this movie , based off of a TV show , and a serious finale . I thought that it might be a bit too hard for a first film , but I can't complain for my second . In the first film , I think the director let the audience know what he was trying to do . In this movie , the director seemed to show more ambition , to the point that I think the movie is not that hard to watch in the end . Overall , I thought that the movie was a very good ending , considering that the first one was .|0

The Charmed ones bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor the protect him from Shax, The Sources assassin. When Shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. He blasts Prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her.

The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.Unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. Earl Dwire plays a halfbreed white and Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day.He and his gang happen upon Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don't have anything worth robbing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and have his way with her.|1
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time . The capitalized print which opens the Spanish thriller, “Para el Amor”, makes me yearn to write something so poetic as it was intended . The film begins with the voice of one of the main characters describing a scene they have witnessed in which his wife, who has just died, tells him that his children need to move to another country to avoid having to deal with the aftermath of the death of their mother, who had also been killed when they were very young.|0
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head , and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park (1947–) shows just how he does this when it comes to women. Park’s first feature “Hands of Gold” (1961) was set in the near future in a world ruled by men, when women have no choice but to keep to the shadows in order to keep the population alive. Park was inspired to write the piece after being told by his female character that women in Korea would be raped by their husbands if she dared speak her mind.|0
Visconti 's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made . While watching , we can only wonder why some of the film makers could not leave their mark behind . The story may be fictional but it certainly is based on true events. It is based on the events that happened in the year 1612 , the year the Holy Roman Empire lost the Italian colonies in North America to the English and their colonists , and the events that are still unfolding today in South America . The film's plot revolves around the life of the Italian nobleman Visconti , who was married to a Portuguese princess.|0
"`` The Long Kiss Goodnight '' is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller , and a career breakthrough for Michael Fassbender. It shows his versatility to play both hero and villain, and the film shows just why he will be a major Hollywood star in the future. "" Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in '' The Long Kiss Goodnight . Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard star in this action-thriller. The film follows a man who kills his wife when he learns she has been unfaithful. Michael Fassbender stars as the husband, Marion Cotillard as the wife, and Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt is the villain."|0
Intelligent summary , is n't it ? If Mad Max was something of a simple , straight forward , nothing more , I would be more than happy to see it come to America. But since it's not and that's a good thing in itself , I still think that the movie would have been better off if it were in English, and American audiences would go out and get it . . . . . I'm still a bit disappointed, however , when I find myself writing about the film when I should be watching some other film . . . .|0
'Blade ' would be an extremely above-average comic-book , vampire-hunter action/horror if it were n't for two minor flaws . First and foremost, the comics themselves are fantastic . I've been reading them for well over 20 years and have never encountered anything this good . This is not a criticism . I have read many, many, many, MANY other comics and none of them compare . So why would a comic-book be this great if these flaws don't apply ? They are flaws that I have encountered numerous times over the years . And the reason why they apply to the comic is because of the content .|0
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series . Well defined characters , tight scripts , varied and interesting story lines and fantastic acting . The cast includes an impressive group of Australian actors , and was one of our favourite programs on the Australian TV scene of the 80’s , and in fact the series has been broadcast on TV in Australia for almost 30 years . But it is the writing that has really been the standout part of the series . The story is about two strangers who meet each other in Sydney and decide they want to go to the other side to escape the world that they have come into.|0
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet ? I can see that a lot of people would like to buy the original version but the fact that they can only buy 1 copy doesn’t seem to make much sense. If this is the case why not have the original series and have people who have never seen them buy the originals in a physical format so they can share it among their friends. I am not sure about the format, I would be more interested if someone could help me out on this.|0
"Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. Would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? Or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting ""older self"" Bruce Willis in a collision course with ""younger self"" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat ""fame"")."|1
Man, what an awful film. As with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. Come on!|1
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center , an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit-card debit cards from a window in a parking garage. It was a scam, according to a court filing. But it was a good scam. Then there’s his friend, a “sneaky guy” who “always kept his head down and worked,” according to his LinkedIn profile. It turns out Paul didn’t have a job after all, so he did his best to keep that reputation up. “I worked from home,” he told me.|0
"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"""|1
Really? Is this necessary? How can somebody make such a film? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the Ending. Completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood!!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car persecution, and I know he can't act.|1
eXistenZ was a good film , at the first I was wondering what is going on , organic `` pods of a , and then the next thing you know after that I realized I was just one of the millions , that it was me ! I just saw it , and I was so blown away by it I can't believe it. I can't even express how much I loved it. It made me feel like a million dollars. It's one of those movies that I will never go out and watch just for the sake of it, I would watch it again and again .|0
This movie is absolutely horrible ! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union , Hill Harper, and others. I wanted it to be better, but what I saw was not as good as the original. My only wish for this was that it would have had a better story and that the movie have some good action scenes to keep me entertained . The only good thing for this film was that there are some good jokes . There are so many reasons why this movie is one of my favs. The way it is structured and everything is done is so good.|0
The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's.|1
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film . but , for whatever reason, I have never been in a better mood! I went to see this movie today with my parents. I saw it again yesterday. And again on Friday. I am so glad I saw this film in the theatre. I would never want to be in a movie theater. I feel that I am being sucked away into another world where I can't tell what's happening because I don't have my normal sensory input. This movie gave me that sensory input.|0
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate.|1
This formulaic film ( hero 's girlfriend marries the villain ) just did n't move along fast enough given some critical reviews! Not sure if it is the plot, the script or simply it just didn't hit the target but the film did not do the best job of capturing what the story was all about. The only part where it moved in a positive direction were the two main scenes. The first was when the two meet up for the first time after the hero has a bad day with a new love interest. For the other, there was just nothing about it that was memorable for me.|0
"Don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier film . It`s not because this is a pointless re- film . That is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the "" remake "" of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago . The scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( But with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be thankful ."|1
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies ! And there are plenty of those ! But not one of these. Just to be clear, I was never a fan of sports movies. But I have watched Sports movies, especially the ones made by ""sports directors"" and I still prefer them over the ones from Hollywood, which are so often made by actors or writers that I can't stand them for any reason. They are usually overrated. If you are one of those fans, I am sorry for you."|0
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater . Despite its local provenance ( and its relation to this blog), this play is very much on my mind right now. I was reminded of it while watching an interview last week on a national TV news program, which featured a young woman who had gone to the theater in her teens, and was very much a theater geek. She was interviewed for an hour or so by a news reporter ( I forget which, but there was at least 2) who was describing the play.|0
As we are well aware, movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history, but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation. I wish the director and/or the screen writer had done his/her research in this topic. All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a rift that should not be there. This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while making the third group (Hindus) look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations.|1
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie , thought of two or three funny lines , then decided they had to get in trouble for having this idea, and tried to hide it to get it off the ground. There are a lot of these movies. There's the film that got banned in the 70's that is still being played in schools now because of what went down during its release, a lot of those movies were made to be funny, there's the movie that was a very bad movie that made it a cult classic, and so on.|0
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid , waiting for Dr. Who . I loved it, I loved all the old shows like The Misfits, The Rocky Horror Show , Doctor Who and I was obsessed with it . I had no idea where all the action would lead me and I felt like I would go crazy watching Doctor Who , but in reality . I really wasn't any good at it . All the time I spent watching was wasted and that was one of the things that made me want to learn the show.|0
* * * * * * Spoilers within * * * * * * * What a dull , predictable, and predictable season! Let us take a few moments to review the last few weeks as a whole. In the first five or ten episodes, everything seemed to be up to speed and then, as we’ve been told repeatedly throughout the series, there was a problem. Now, I am a person of faith, so I tend to think of God in very general terms. But there are many things about the God of the Bible that I have learned in my time in the Bible.|0
Barbershop 2: Back in Business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. The movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.|1
"""The Apartment Complex"" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. This low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. ""The Apartment Complex"" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes."|1
When I first saw the trailer for this film , I really wanted to see it . I thought some of it was pretty cool , some of it was not that much fun to sit through . The trailer made me want to see it as much as I saw the film . The first time I heard of the film I was excited because of that trailer . When I saw it at the IFC Center I was so excited . There I was seeing the trailers of the film I was so excited . When the movie first came out I was able to see that I really liked it .|0
Watched this film at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. A simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot.The film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.|1
Went to the Preview Engagement of `` Grand Champion '' today ( Dallas/Fort Worth , Austin , Snyder and a few other venues) and thought it was very well done. There were only two really bad things in my opinion: First, there was no sound. Not even for the pre-recorded audio, just the audio for the prelude. There was a big gap between the audio and the prelude. Secondly, there were no background music at all on the prelude but not at all in the track. There was a lot of blaring noise at the beginning, but not so much later.|0
"Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after ""Next Friday"").It's basically just crap. How can you possibly call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, ""Hey, it's realistic, they have been like this."" Fine, but why bother us with it?"|1
"I was so excited to finally watch ""Pulse"" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of ""A Tale of Two Sisters""."|1
"Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. Whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. The Radio DJ, ""we must stay on air"" spends effectively no time on air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the USA or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word ""zombie""?"|1
"A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life . It could be set in any town in the UK or a small town in France. This is a perfect gift for the young and old. I hope you enjoy it. Thursday, 19 February 2015

I think I’ve given up on it. But then this morning when I went down to the loo, I had the feeling I’m just going to have to get over it. It was such an easy task. A simple task that could just be done on my phone or laptop."|0
At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this film enough, and I'll gladly watch it again.But boy does it have a lot of problems.|1
THE NEXT KARATE KID , in my opinion , is an excellent martial arts flick . I thought that Eric Carton was a great choice for the lead role in the movie because he is a real martial artist . Carton also does Martial arts for quite some time , which is another reason to pick this guy for the role . While watching the movie , Carton is the best thing in the movie , his fight scenes are good . This man is a martial artist , so he knows what he is doing when it comes to fighting . He knows how to fight , just as well .|0
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when I came out I immediately checked into H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say I have been off the Hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since.|1
Rowan Atkinson 's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy , Buster Keaton , the Marx Brothers , Charlie Chaplin , and a great many of the classic movies of the silent era. Mr. Bean tells the tale of an ordinary boy who, with the help of his mother and his faithful dog, wins the heart of the most eligible lady of the town. He is so popular with everyone that he runs into trouble with his teacher, a man of ill repute, and he must take refuge in the forest until he is rescued by some unlikely allies.|0
"""The Moon Is Blue"" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" Whereas he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words ""virgin"" and ""mistress"" in his mild 1953 comedy ""The Moon Is Blue,"" Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" since Dick Powell made his law and order epic ""To the Ends of the Earth""(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics."|1
"The mission to see the movie `` The Cave '' was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing a friend of the author's play. It was the first time this friend saw a movie about a cave. The story was very different than we imagined. It is also the last time I can recall watching a movie about a cave."" The film, "" The Cave,"" which premiered on Feb. 18, is now available at http://www.hollywooddistribution.com/film.asp?file=the_cave.html and can also be found on DVD at http://distributors.hollywood.com/cave_movie/film.asp.

This is an excellent documentary about a story I had n't heard about before . The first solo , non-stop, non-stop, world record run of an ultra long distance footrace . I have only ever run a half marathon so far . This documentary was a wonderful insight into how an ultra long distance runner can go to such an extreme amount of miles . I can't wait for more documentaries to come out which show how it is possible to do this . And I know I'm only in my mid 30's but I don't think I ever thought I would be able to do this .|0
I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out.|1
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales . . . but this time, it’s not with a smile on his face (or in it). Last week’s review of Welsh Buses, a book by Martin Evans, was both sad and hopeful. It seemed to confirm that there is no such thing as ‘good news’ in Welsh politics . . . only bad news . . . but that did little to quieten the critics. So it was good news to see that there was still hope in On The Buses.|0
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan . Now I have to see this movie. There was a time or two that Martin Sheen was considered the greatest actor of all time and he has had a long career in movies but not many people know that he is a wonderful man. He is a very humble and decent guy who doesn't like to brag and thinks he is always right. I have seen this movie for the first time and I must tell you it was very well done and the acting was very good .|0
( Contains spoilers ) People who put a Lonely Heart 's ad in the newspaper are often idealists . They are idealists . Their ad may be idealistic . Their ad may not be idealistic . Their idealisticness may get them into trouble . What if someone did an ad for ' The Lonely Hearts Club of Chicago' and they didn't want their idealisticness to get them into trouble?

A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some Northern idiots come to the deep South looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are menaced by scary hillbillies, in a wide nod to 'Deliverance'; but it turns out that the hicks are fronting for a Northern marijuana-trafficking badass. This is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. The women are locked up and raped into catatonia; rather than rescuing them, the guys run down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them.|1
When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an `` intelligent person '' is like , they fail so miserably , but I'll show you exactly what I think . First , let me begin with an analogy , and a question : what do you call the person with a very low IQ ? Think you are that person? Think again . First of all , think you are a high IQ person? Then why did you choose the word high IQ ? Well , if we are all of the same IQ , why is it that only the high IQ people can be the smartest people in the world ?|0
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal which I have visited. It is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.A film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. Well, a wait is a wait.|1
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as I remember it being.The story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know throughout was, TO DO WHAT EXACTLY?|1
This is the best work i have ever seen on television . The story is compelling -- all the more so because it's based on actual events . I can't find the words to adequately express my feelings, so please go watch this show and then you'll understand my reaction . It's worth every dollar, every second . It's so good that you'll probably never see it again . And now, I'm not going to say too much about the plot, since I really can't go into it . I love the characters so much, the writing and acting so much .|0
"The thing which makes ""Fire"" even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry, is its touch of femininism and rebellion. To my mind, the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife Sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy, as per the same narrative which appears in the film too."|1
A horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates.|1
Ostensibly , Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother , a nagging wife , and a mother-in-law ' who can never accept his homosexuality . But this isn't really what Hans does , not after all . After all , he doesn't have to hide his secret , he's no longer ashamed of the things he has done and can do . Even so , Hans goes on to be an active and loving member of a gay society in Germany . There is a lot that Hans goes through in the beginning .|0

"'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in ""Fires in the Mirror"").Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them, than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say."|1
This movie was boring. Very much like Underworld, only even less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. The lead couple were boring. I totally didn't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the film. The plot was paper thin. The transformations were basically nil. I did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, I would have liked that better. I wouldn't recommend this movie.|1
This show is terrible. I cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. This is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. I have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.What the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights.|1
"Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America , and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed. But he has recently been involved in an unfortunate controversy involving a number of his films. Now, after much speculation, we’re here to explain what happened.

I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many, which is why I will be doing my best not to watch them. However, I feel that by giving them a pass I'm giving you the opportunity to give them a try and see if they work for you - you don't have to hate them - I love them! In fact, this post is an attempt to make it a little bit easier to do that. If you can, read on for the best of the best about Guts of a Beauty.|0
"The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French `` Emmanuelle 2 . '' This amazing nude model was on screen for one hour and 30 seconds, but it is said that she was the only woman to be in this film. The following article is an interesting account of sex, prostitution and other sex-related subjects in Germany during the late 19th or early 20th century. (A story of sex and murder in the German countryside.) SOURCES





This is by no means the only reference I have found in German literature on prostitution during the early part of the 20th century."|0
Never , ever , have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people living in an apartment for a year and a half in Tokyo. If you've ever been there, you'd know the city has a population of over 100 million people. There are about 4,000 places to eat in the five-star Michelin restaurant in Shibuya that they rent to the residents of this apartment for a year . When you look out the window and you see a bunch of kids playing basketball outside of a small school, you'd probably think the school was full of people playing basketball, too.|0
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. He hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure by a long shot. You can't tell that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow-motion, though.|1
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40 's and 50 's , you were guaranteed great things, but you certainly didn’t think she was a big name or had any great accomplishments. You might think that as a Hollywood legend she would have had more than enough clout, or perhaps she'd have had more success than the likes of Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis. But that wasn't the case. She wasn’t well-known in Hollywood then. Many people were unaware of her work, or, to be more accurate, thought of her work in the late 30's.|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off.|1
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATED this film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol.|1
"I am not understanding why people are praising this movie . I did n't like it at all . I find it boring and not worth watching . If you did like this movie you must have watched some other movies in this genre that are much better than this one . I think this movie is a good action movie but I can't tell why it's getting so many good reviews . Maybe it's because people who like this genre know what they're talking about

This is a really good, fast paced action flick, with an excellent action choreography and great fight sequences."|0
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version . I rather enjoyed it . Either way , I think it’s time for a sequel. I have a few ideas for sequel. I’m a fan of both the MST2 and MST3 versions of this show and I really enjoy the way the series has turned out. I’ll never understand why people complain about this show, the original series has been available on VHS and DVDs for over 30 years now and has become one of the best series ever.|0
"I 've never understood this type of spoof movies . You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and loves , and then try to milk it until the last drop of water. You see a movie with a really cool cast , you see some really cool stuff, and you find yourself at the end of the film saying, ""Hey man, what the f#@%# are we even talking about?"" It's just as bad as it gets when you think you have it down, and then you find out you haven't."|0
Not the best of the WIP's, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. Yet the acting, dialogue, preposterous scenarios, and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm. As much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors go to Sybil Danning. Also, special kudos to Henry Silva, who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously.|1
At least for me . I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was really impressed with his performance and dedication to the task of being the very best. It is true that he is not in the best condition but still he showed his true level and that is really impressive. It is really sad to see a person who really deserves the recognition of this world but still he should be respected for what he is able to do and how hard he tries for his work. I have never seen anything like this in my life .|0
`` Carlito 's Angels '' is a spoof of `` Charlie 's Angels '' that is not afraid to spoof itself in a new episode of the hit show on The CW. And that's not to mention The CW has yet to air this particular episode of Charlie's Angels in the U.S. It is set in the fictional Los Angeles, but the actors are actually in Miami, not Los Angeles, so this is a real-life story. The show is not rated but it is funny enough to get a laugh from almost anyone.|0
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of a sorority I didn't want them to make Greek organizations look bad....but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.All the characters are pretty likable minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha His character brings so much to the show.|1
"Thankfully you do n't need a lot of `` book learnin '' to understand where this thing 's going ... You know, there's a good analogy for you, too. We all need to understand that thing we just learned, in order to do our job. I see this a lot around here. I've noticed that people come here, and say things like, ""...I'm going to have to go to this class to learn how to use x."" And I've said, ""Oh, that makes a lot of sense."|0
"Years ago , I used to watch bad movies deliberately . Somehow I missed this one . No gesture rings a bell when watching the movie , though. I don't remember why , but I did miss this movie. I wonder why , a couple years back I thought I could watch a movie ,

But I could never find a movie like it, which made me realize that it was one of the better movies ever made . No , not because of the actors , of course , not even that . I would have never watched a movie like that."|0
OH MY God I am lost Now I know everything this guy does is Pointless R J A wrote at 1:30pm on November 28, 2018: I’ve got a very good reason not to be here.

"This is one awful movie!! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I sure disagree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew I guess. In addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.As bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons but it's a good ""so bad that it's fun"" flick.By the way, there's no such thing as ""La Castagne""."|1
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see.As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics.|1
This is probably Wayne 's poorest movie ; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role . This time he was the star . For once the director did a better job. But there were a lot of elements that were really bad . The special effects were just awful . The sound effects . The acting was so so bad . To begin with, there was very little dialogue in Wayne's movie. I don't think there was much in the movie either . Most of Wayne's scenes were actually in the movie . Wayne talked very little , but that's not necessarily a good thing .|0
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi , based of his biography ` Wired ' , wrote by Bob Balaban , who was an American movie screenwriter , he worked with George Lucas and wrote many Hollywood movies like ` Star Wars , ` Star Trek , etc . As John Belushi was the most famous comedian of the 20th century , he wrote his autobiography ` Wired ' in 1986 . This book narrate his journey from the stage and the movie , and his life story . I think this movie will be a nice movie for all fans .|0
I really enjoyed this movie . Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie , but Bruce Willis learned , from one point to the next , to not make it seem that way. I found the whole movie to be quite believable. The acting is all great. I loved how they played off of each other throughout the whole thing. Overall this was a great movie . I'm glad this movie didn't have to end the way the ending of the first X-MEN did. I didn't feel like I was seeing a movie, more like a documentary about mutant life.|0
Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the very northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings.|1
"The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my ""tilt switch"" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had."|1
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport , ace reporter Dan Carter ( Harry Kerwin , he is also credited as Harry Kerwin ) takes a ride in a black Ford Mustang with a bunch of strangers. As he travels around, he begins to sense things about the passengers of the car. The stranger of this car is a white woman , and he begins to tell her about his own life story and her own life story, and they talk about their families . As she tells him about her family , the man in the Mustang begins to look at her and his own life story, and begins to have doubts.|0
"This movie was lacking in a lot of areas. It's about this Elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. THey want the Elvis guy to be their ""driver"". At times, I wanted the folks from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. Sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as ""What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE"". That was cheesy."|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most over all. I mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. It's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. Just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game!|1
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire . It 's not a hallmark of cinema, and there's no real reason to believe it will. That's what makes it so good. It's been said that the best way to make something better is to not make something better at all. It's said that the best films are the one's that don't try and do it, and the one's that make the audience cry and cheer. The best movies are the ones that don't do it at all, because it just makes no sense.|0
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts).|1
I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information : Score 6,7 , well ... it had a rating of 6.2 but the reviews said the same. I can see how that is but still the fact of the film being well made and having a great plot is quite amazing and something you should check out. I would like to say that it is my favourite movie out of this decade but I am not sure I would. I think I might like it even less if it wasn't based on a comic book and had been made with more originality.|0
I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher was n't involved with this `` movie '' . An even more surprising aspect is that they both appear on the list of celebrities to endorse the documentary. And both are listed in the credits as co-authors. In fact, they appear as co-authors on the same page of credits. What this means is that while they didn't directly contribute financially to the `` documentary '' or to this movie in any way, they are responsible for producing the film, which, in turn, is responsible to them for having a presence on the film-makers.|0
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls . It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all the kids could have fun and be free! The main character was a fairy that was able to change herself to look like anyone she wanted! This was such a classic fairy tale that I just loved it . I don't know if I can find it on YouTube but it was such a sweet fairy tale I wanted the kids to know about! This movie is so great and you will really love it if you take a look at it.|0
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this film. One: Okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited.|1
Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean, gripping, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years.|1
Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.The cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme.|1
"It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half-an-hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so I naively thought). The mutt fails to look all that fearsome, which Leonard Maltin, the notoriously clueless/hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree with: he considers Cujo to be ""genuinely frightening""."|1

After three months of pretending not to be gay he finally had the opportunity to be with someone and it turned into a nightmare for his wife. In this clip he is talking about being with someone who is not straight - he is talking about his friend, but he is gay as well.|0
I rented this movie , after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of `` five stars ! '' I thought that it was worth the money I had spent on the rental. The movie is a great mystery and it takes the viewer on an emotional journey. I didn't like all the way that it ended because of the ending, but overall, this one was worth the movie. I'm looking forward to the sequel and I can see myself buying the DVD again in the near future. Thank you. I saw this last year, was very impressed by it.|0
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted . Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films from the 90's . The only reason why this film isnt on the list is because its so bad that it needs to be shown in the theater . It's really a shame that so much has been written and shown but its hard to keep all of them on the list . I hope this film will be brought back and I have every confidence that this movie will be a very big hit for the future . The only way this film would ever be given a chance is if it was remade .|0
There's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. Hell hath no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo(Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami.|1
*Minor spoilers* I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons.|1
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. I suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.But putting that aside, I found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead Vincent Spano.I have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies I missed during that decade.|1
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Monterey/Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant).|1
I did n't expect much from this movie , it was just one of those movies I thought I 'd never see. But then again it was not because I wasn't expecting too good. I guess that is what it is about , it has it all . I did get a good laugh at one point but it wasn't as funny in the end as I 'd hoped to see it . I'm not sure how I feel about this one. It could have easily been a mediocre movie. I liked it but I wouldn't pay too much for a movie like that.|0
I cant put it any simpler than that , this is a terrible film . I 've worked in the music industry before , and its always the same thing , music gets put in a band , a band is formed , music gets released , then they try to sell it and try to sell the idea that this is a great album , but they just don't have the vision of a band , or the passion of a band , so the band doesn 't continue. this is not the case with this band. This is a bad album.|0
I heard that after the first Oceans movie , the sequels begin to go downhill . I believe that this has happened before . The first time was in the early 1990s , and the second time was a decade ago . What happened after that ? I would think that they tried to do something different . I do not think the second film is the worst , but it is the worst they could do . Maybe it is just me . They should do another sequel ? What do you think ? A few people have asked me if I'm going to see a third one.|0
This movie had an excellent premise , and could have been a fascinating look at racism , attitudes to women and how people react to each other in the face of violence , I mean how often does racism and sexism work in real life ? It was a great story , and I did like how the film ended , it was a really good ending. I don't think I will watch this again unless I'm at a film festival or something so it didn't bother me too much and I was really happy to have seen it , but I would have like to have seen more of the movie .|0
What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump?|1
Why is n't this movie on the bottom 100 ? Raptor is , without a doubt , the worst movie of the decade. There are many reasons to why but the most important one I can think of is that this movie is bad for business. The people who have been making a profit out of it over the years were very unhappy. This movie was not a commercial success, and the people making a profit out of it have been unhappy for decades. It is time to give this film a second chance.|0
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit But when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene. i don even see why you would go to see it on your own.|1
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But, I liked it. I found myself grinning through the entire movie. I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I pictured them. And the town and scenery were just right as well. I recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.|1
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. That's James Brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse?|1
"The recent release of ""Mad Dog Morgan"" on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic DVD version. ""Mad Dog Morgan"" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia."|1
This is one of the best films I 've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles and their performances do not fall into one category. I must also say, this is one of the films where I would have enjoyed watching a film in 3D. I am not sure if this is in theaters or something else. I must admit that i didn't watch this in the theater but i'll take a chance that i didn't miss anything by just going to my local theater and waiting for the movie to play on the screen before i go watch it at home.|0
"This one was truly awful. Watching with fascinated horror, I kept on asking ""why have they done this?"" That is, taken all the scenarios out of ""The Day after Tomorrow"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Twister"" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it."|1
This is one of the best action films I have seen. Geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'Charly'/gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'Stuart Little'.|1
"This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the DVD at the video store and think ""why not"". Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) at how good it was and how much I enjoyed it.Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it."|1
I 'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here . First is from the view of a director. And then I want to see the director's opinion on the movie. It's kind of two movies, you see. There's the story that's going on in this movie and then there's your own thoughts about the movie. So, we've got a director's view on this movie and then your views on the movie, so, what I want to do is try to talk about both of these things.|0
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I 've seen in a long time.It 's marketed as as Sci-Fi.I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi and I would not have enjoyed this film.It seemed like a movie about some guys playing pool and I couldn't understand a damn thing that happened.I'm not sure what the point is but I will say that it didn't add much to my movie list.I wish the director would have taken a different direction or done something different.They could have made this more entertaining if they had.I would give it 3 1/2 stars.|0
There is only one word to define the whole movie , that is : awful . How `` Mostly Martha'' was a bad movie is something that could never be known to a viewer. But the acting , the storyline , the script and the special effects make it seem like the movie was really just a piece of bad writing and not worth the money, let alone the time spent to see it. The whole movie is not worth the time spent . You see, the movie is based around Martha Stewart , who is really a good person and not an evil person .|0
* * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * * My boyfriend , some friends , and I rented this car . It was really fun to drive with him . After a few days , he said “ this is the most boring car I ever had” . I knew he wasn’t right , but I was still a bit shocked , and still a little upset about it . I have seen this car from different view points . It looks so much like his family’s Porsche 911 Carrera . I was thinking that they are the same .|0
This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and flat bore. I can't recommend it because it was the last film I wanted to see in theaters. But if you haven't read the other reviews from people who haven't liked it, that's fine. It's still very much worth reading because the other reviews were spot on with some great observations and insights on how the film could have been done better or how it didn't work as intended. That's the part that makes me want to go back to the theatre.|0
This is a magnificent, and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy, with my throat almost strangled with tears, and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD.Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.The fiancé, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic.|1
By Jove , what an unholy mess ! Revenge , incestuous love , mechanical games-like fighting , ceaseless and utterly pointless violence ... what else could one possibly want in life ? This is not the case. It is in fact a good thing, for a time it might have been better, but it is an evil one, now it is all a mess and I do not know if I could live with myself. If only the government would stop this mess, it could then make a proper mess of itself instead. But I would not want to. I really would not.|0
"This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad ""Alien lifeforms inhabit earth"" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian ""Judgement day is at hand, seek Jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell"" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this."|1
Wow -- this movie was really bad ! You talk about formulaic , typical movie plot ? Watching this movie, I was thinking that I didn't find any good movie plot lines , I don't know why it got so good ratings. The only one that comes to my mind is the beginning , where the main character is at the bottom of the stairs with his wife , he just doesn't give her a break. Well, I think it's because of the script of the movie, it seems like it's full of formulaic plot lines.|0
Chan-wook Park , you have to hand it to the guy . In my eyes , he 's not only the greatest singer of all time . But his songs are some of the best . You can listen to him at least 40 times , without even thinking of his name . I think it 's not even possible . His music really has a timeless quality to it . All the great music of today is based on that music . Even if I 'm not a musician , I can sing it . And I 'm not a poet .|0
The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this! In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the populace that whoever messes with Chuck or his people have to pay the piper. This one is no fun.|1
It is terrible! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful.|1
I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company , but I understand that the producers of this film want it to be released internationally . If this film is available in Australia as well then it’s time for an Australian version , as there is something that Australian people have to be reminded of , not just in this film, but for a large part of the world . Why do Australian people love movies ? Because they have a deep connection with the people , and the emotions of the audience .|0
I viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course,was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett.|1
I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. The film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. The acting was absolutely dreadful. The children were overly whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept from peace. The monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. The drama is laugh-worthy. I cannot remember when I saw a more dreadful film.|1
Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies . We picked `` Ik ook van de nacht'' which we had just seen in the cinema the previous night. The movie was a good one , a little long, a little slow - I think it might be better with a shorter length. We went by train to the theater , got our tickets, had a drink at a bar , took the train again . We got there about 10 minutes late , and we walked in and sat down and had some beers.|0
I 'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A . Not only do they sound as if they are reviewing a new product, they are also going into details that are completely contradictory to what they are saying about the new game. I know the game is an expansion, but it sounds like a lot of people have gotten spoiled and are not going to get their hands on the expansion. It also sounds like they are going in with the idea that if they want to play, they should just go to the base game first.|0
"There is no reason to watch this film.Why? Many reasons. First up, the acting is awful. There is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. It is awfully written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line.""Repeat?"""|1
Actually, Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is no where on par for CGI, but I would give it the same vote.Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role.|1
One of the best 'guy ' movies I 've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion . . . or at least the first one . . . and that's just one of the many ways I like it. That movie's a great movie, but I don't think I've ever seen it in a theater. I don't really like movie theaters very much, and I can't remember the last movie that I've seen in one. I think the theater I went to this time was the IMAX theater in Chicago, which is pretty bad, but still great.|0
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.|1
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if you're a horror junkie you would probably not like the film at all. There is absolutely nothing special about the film , so don't go into it with much knowledge of the classic horror genres . It's probably best not to watch the movie in full because there are some great horror movies out there . Just remember if you get this film in the theaters you have nothing to lose and there are some awesome horror films waiting to be watched on the big screen .|0
"""Driving Lessons"" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (Linney), and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.Grint's portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film."|1
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime , i stumbled upon this great film , “ The Last Movie”. I had no idea why i fell in love so quickly with this classic film, but i just knew i wanted to see more. So i set off to purchase the film. After a few days of waiting for a good price on this great flick , i was lucky to find it for free, in my local library. So i bought it. My first impression was that it is a perfect film , and i was immediately hooked.|0
`` 200l : A Space Odyssey '' is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind 's role in the past and future as well as the future of humanity in space. The film is the first to depict the role of a man, the first to tell the full story of Dr. Carl Sagan, one of the most gifted scientists of all time, and also the first to tell the full story of his wife and partner, Dr. Mary Sagan. The story follows Dr. Sagan throughout his journey, as he discovers his purpose on Earth.|0
Mute Witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it might deserve. It’s one of those cases that seems to never get the time it deserves because all the big players are just trying to protect their reputations. That’s not necessarily a good thing, though, because it leads to other stories that might be just as interesting. That’s especially true if you consider what’s to follow, because the story’s ending will be just as fascinating.|0
I would give this a zero if they had that rating . Fun was no fun at all . I am not one of those people that is all about the game so I just thought that was what you wanted to know . I can honestly say that the game was fun , if a little difficult at times especially if you don t get used to it or you are not a big gamer , you will probably have fun , if your a gamer you will love it . I did , the graphics were not perfect but the game was great and a fun game .|0
I do n't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about , the main issue that the story is about is how do you kill a person without using a weapon and in a way where it won't be taken seriously. It's not because I am against firearms, but this is a movie dealing with this very thing. We all see people get killed, but very rarely is this the main thing that happens, especially in a story. I guess we have to put a bit more of emphasis on this aspect, because there are other reasons this movie is so bloody.|0
This movie was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera movies. It is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods, where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years. In those time that passed, the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue, which is where a demon god sleeps; they want the god to help them.|1
"What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this on the rest of us. It makes no sense whatsoever to me. I can understand that this movie is supposed to be ""fun"", as they would have us believe, but it just seems so much like a big cash grab by some greedy executives that it just seems wrong to me. The movie looks great on the screen. It really has an interesting storyline, and I found it difficult not to spend the whole time I was there."|0
Fortunately , I have n't seen this film in a movie , big screen , just on a small screen. The music and the voice over did not inspire me to see it. I have not watched this film , nor have I been to any other films in this genre. As I say I do not like movies , but i am a fan of the series , so I am curious. But I guess this is the last question for the day, i have to leave this here. I have to do my work and go to bed early.|0
"Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the ""Dekalog"" but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure.The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5)."|1
One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent.|1
"Not too many people seem to know about this movie . Which is too bad because I think it 's a great movie . The trailer alone has made me go see this film . and now this movie is on the big screen and it is an incredible movie . This movie was directed by and stars the great and greats : 
- Richard Attenborough 
- Sean Connery  
- Peter Fonda . and of course it is a great cast . The story is that a scientist creates a computer virus and turns it into a super soldier who can take over the worlds ."|0
Young writers , young auteur , young cast , busload of producers , what could go wrong ? Everything . That’s why I started this blog. I want to show all the young, talented, creative and up-and-coming talent here in Malaysia. I will also show the world what Malaysian talent can do if supported by the fans and fans’ support. To that end, this will be the place where all the young talents come together and express their talents. I hope this blog will serve as a platform for all talents to showcase themselves and get noticed by the world.|0
Ah the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often I think, do you ever show good movies? OK you have given me the great 'Heroes' and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. I checked out the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact I am half thinking that this is a pseudo name).|1
Bronson took the money and ran with this film ; he must have house payments like me ! This low budget film is just a joke ! The acting is good but this film should not have been made.I don`t care how you look at it. Just watch it and realize that there are no great films in it. I'm sorry you don't like the film but it's a shame that a lot of these low budget movies are not getting made. This is an example of a very common problem that all movies have.|0
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen.|1
.... is where I 'm assuming this movie came from . I mean , I 've watched plenty of B-movies in my day, but none of 'em have come close to this. In fact , it is probably the closest thing I have yet seen. I am sure someone out there has a better explanation, but that is my take on it, as I really don 't have anything better than what I have seen. The film was in black and white ( I believe) and it looked and felt very real. I don 't recall any scenes at all where the actors were dressed as zombies.|0
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I am now starting to be somewhat disappointed with how the novel came about. So many things that are said in the first 20 pages are incorrect. I don't think the reader has a good grasp of all the complexities of the first 20 pages, in fact I think most readers will not think about them and therefore they may not fully appreciate how important they are in all of the other pages in the novel.|0
"... and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together, his face twisted up into a huge smile. ""This is so amazing, I want to cry! What a great thing you are doing for me,"" I say. It is the only time he smiles that day. I know I could do so much for him. I could get him into bed, I could be the love interest for him, and he would never even know it had happened. But I want to be an artist."|0
I've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. When a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress playing Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it.|1
In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo comes to London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.|1
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a bore-fest from start to finish, that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. Neil Young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle-of-the-road mediocrity.|1
"As a kid, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing.I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it, instead, on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. I figured, this HAD to be better. I was wrong.The movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an ""evil wind."""|1
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this film. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. Maybe this movie isn't Academy Award material, but it sure is feel good material.|1

"I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. There was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original ""Lone ranger"", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing at children's hospitals as the Lone ranger for sick kids.) To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger."|1
As a serious marathoner, I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. While I did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of Deena Kastor, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: These were brief!!|1
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer.|1
Okay,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him/her but think a little less. This is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. THis is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. The only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is over an the top, nonstop, laugh your rear end off it is so stupid, badly made movie.|1
"Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous ""fantasy"" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on ""The Shield"") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those ""Saturday Night Live"" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done."|1
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film.|1
"I love this movie. At first, I didn't expect much of this movie since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (I've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since I saw ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should've played Minnie's part and vice versa."|1
Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say , most of the other reviews I saw there were mixed. This review I'm writing is more like a review I wrote a month ago when I reviewed it, on the day it was originally aired. It is not as good as my review last month.The first hour or so, I had mixed feelings. I found it funny, I thought it was good. I thought it was funny. But it didn't hit my buttons the way it should.|0
Watching the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody, but I'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that), and I can assure you it's not worth watching. It's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte.|1
go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam. despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the cliché writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam.|1
I have just seen Today You Die. It is bad, almost very bad.1) The direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad.2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful.|1
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. You can, however, see how far she has come.The one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s.The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting.|1
`` The Planet '' is an astounding piece of film making . For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned their back-of-the-napkin ideas into an actual film, which they say will be released to the public on November the 12th. For the uninitiated , it's a great idea . The film is set to be a huge box-office hit and will set a benchmark . It has been produced on a budget of just under $4 million , which makes them one of the biggest production teams ever in the business . They also did a very good job . The cast and crew are very well chosen .|0
"Brilliant Aussie movie ... A little slow at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n't stop watching it

The Australian Film Channel is a great place to watch movies from all over the world. I was very pleased to be invited to a screening of the first season of House of Cards. It's also very entertaining and I recommend it. I also recommend the Australian Movie Channel for a great variety of movies. This was the first time my son and I got to see this film. The DVD is only available on DVD."|0
It 's the Sooooouullltakaaaa ! Wow . What a skin peeling bad movie . Honestly , this is one of my most fav films . I mean, I can only watch it . I love the music in this movie . This film has great music . But when it came to the skin peel , I felt like the movie became very dull . All of the scenes had to be watched in a single take and then you just got to blink . This was my least favorite . I just didn’t like this film . So yeah, I’m gonna pass this one on .|0
Being a fan of the series I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What's with that dance scene??? The only reason I didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny.|1
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all is the plot a very thin plot (Wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN!!!!!!!!!!|1
"Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of ""Delusion"" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. When Jennifer Rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between Secor and Metzler is beyond ridiculous."|1
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary, then later felt different about it, I would return and make known my change of heart. So far, this is the first time it's happened. I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a tad surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner.|1
James Stewart plays Johnny Mason, lawyer. Carole Lombard is Jane Mason, wife. Lucile Watson the mother-in-law Harriet Mason. Johnny sees Jane and quickly marries her. Mother is disappointed. Mother lives with them. Many troubles are ahead. Jane can't cook. Can't set the table. Can't do many things according to mother. The interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. Stewart and Lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. Stewart is Stewart. He is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film.|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2!!!). I could find nothing to redeem this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor but I doubt that's why shes there.The dialogue is truly appalling.|1
"Can't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as ""Special Thanks"" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock YOU'RE AN IDIOT."|1
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, it is no surprise that they are the most popular movie genre of all. For that reason, this article is dedicated to the greatest directors in cinema history and their greatest films, to the point of discussing whether or not their films fall under some of the current definitions of “hate” and “violence.” These definitions are not absolute, but they are the current standard of how to describe a film that has a “negative” or “unpleasant” effect.|0
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw. The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. You can't see anything in this movie. It is way to dark. The parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done so much better then this.|1
Man oh man , this was a piece of dog sh # t . I read a few reviews on different sites about how nice this was, and I am a sucker for dog sh.. but I've never tried one myself, but I am pretty sure I am in the minority and that I could easily give this one to my best friend. I've tried different sh and they all come out pretty dry and I feel like I'm going to have a hard time holding it together until they are done and it comes out super dry.. so I think I will give this one a try.|0
"Awful, awful, awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy ""Biggest Loser"" is. Picture this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with IQs in the 3-digit area WANT TO WATCH? Everything drags on forever, with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care?"|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward ... granted i am an old soul and am in no way an expert on this scene, but this is what i recall so clearly about the scene and i can't believe i was able to remember the scene and how the camera was moving and what was happening. I remember thinking, in the scene how was the camera supposed to move. I remember thinking something was wrong with the lighting, and I didn't think it was the camera moving.|0
Supposedly , a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less murdered. The movie is one that is very interesting, as well as disturbing, but you have to go in with an open mind. That being said, I have been thinking a great deal about this as I watched the movie last night, and have been unable to shake off my belief in it for weeks. So here is my analysis of the movie as well as the movie itself. And here is my question for the viewers: Do you think this is real?|0
"I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I purchased and read the book ""Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds"". And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight."|1
I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. Of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr. Frankenstein's did. There is always something they didn't anticipate. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here.|1
I had seen this movie when I was a boy ( Before WWII ) and was surprised that the local theater had not played it, because I would have loved it ( it was my first movie at that theater and I loved it ) but alas, it was never on our screen. This time I was not disappointed. It is not a horror movie per se, but it is a comedy movie. It may be the best comedy movie I ever watched ( I know, I know) but the movie was very entertaining and made you think. It is so funny.|0
I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV . In some sort of odd , surreal manner , I watched my friends and I play a game of catch against some of our school friends. At the end of the game one of my friends got to hit the ball through a fence and into a crowd of people. I mean , it was like the entire place went crazy. So I got in the stands and tried to get a good look at it and I can still see all of them standing there, mouths agape.|0
i love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the Jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more.|1
This movie totally sucked!!! Don't even rent it! You'll hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins cant fly! Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. I am not who you think I am!|1
"I feel terribly sorry ! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting , marvelous , full of spirit and elegance , this movie was not at all . Why it is not in any way enjoyable ? This is a true masterpiece of a great actor , a great actor of the world of acting , not a great actor in real life . Who would not love to see such a wonderful movie . Now we have a true genius of the acting field . A master of acting , a genius of the world of acting ...

Well, I didn't like the Lubitsch-pic. I didn't like it at all."|0
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick . Instead they go around and recreate the same old crap over and over so it's hard to figure out what is new and what is just the same as it was last time. It also makes it hard for a fan like me to tell if the movies are bad or not. It's hard to believe that the last Star Trek movie was bad, but after all that time they haven't done anything wrong. I think most of the time the film was good, and I think it was very good.|0
No,no,no. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates,as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems like a colorized version of Psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Norman,and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folks,do yourself some justice. Don't bother with this.|1
Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in `` Beware , My Lovely , '' a play that is the first in a trilogy of plays, all directed by Robert Wilson. Lupino stars as the heroine, a woman who is the victim of an evil stranger who wants to use her as a decoy. And he does. She is being stalked in her own home , with her husband and two sons around, who are also the victims of his evil intent. The first in a series of plays. The title character in the title role of this play is played by Lupino.|0
Not a balanced point of view. The director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. The movie has some criticism of Fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. But that is not the case.The movie barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the MRTA insurgents that took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning.|1
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart : I would say this is certainly the best movie of 2015 and I cannot wait to see this movie on its 3D screens! It is simply wonderful to see this movie on a 3D screen as I have not experienced 3D movies like this in years, I am actually a little bit disappointed that this movie is not in 3D but I will still make sure I am able to see this one someday. This movie is also the movie that I have always wanted to see and has been my favorite film ever!|0
"Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder ""Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?"" For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine ."|1
Jennifer Montgomery 's `` Art for Teachers of Children '' is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . Montgomery 's gritty and intense story of a middle school art teacher and his struggles to live up to the very high expectations he has for himself is told in three parts, the first of which depicts a teacher's attempt to make the grade . The second part deals with the repercussions of the teacher's own actions, the third being a story that follows him from school to the streets of the city. There are few scenes more shocking than the first half of this story and no story of its kind that I have seen .|0
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them. It basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. After viewing the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. IT'S NOT ENTERTAINING in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women.|1
I watched this film not knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this.|1
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world ! An absolute masterpiece , with a both bizarre and beautiful plot , and that's why it will be exported by the end of this month. I just saw the trailer on Facebook, and it was a shock to see that this movie could be exported so easily. I wonder if this is the real reason why it has not been released in this country. I had no idea this was a movie. I thought it was kind of a strange and unusual idea to have a movie make a sequel to a movie.|0
There are a whole lot of movies , primarily from the 80s , that are so terrible that you caouldn't make it into the 80s , because they are either so awful that you would never, ever watch the movie , or it is just a horrible movie, and so it would never be funny enough to be a movie, and so you will never watch the movie , and so it won't be anything to look forward to. Well I think it is a good idea to watch some of these movies. So I have watched them, and I have seen atleast half of all these movies.|0
"One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with ""Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/Adventure Holywood movies...,"" as if those weren't reason enough to love it! Anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. See it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film."|1
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again . From the first image taken the camera was pointed in the general direction of the explosion. It seemed as if a missile had just hit the ground in front of the camera, and it was hard to make out from where the camera was filming. The explosion itself was so loud, it could be heard in the background, but it didn't seem like anyone else was even close to that part of the earth. I think this was taken about 2 minutes and 12 seconds after the first explosion.|0
"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of).The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes."|1
"Given Christopher Nolan 's string of successful films , it 's a no brainer for me to want to check out his other projects as well. And so, here 's my round up of Christopher Nolan films that I absolutely must watch. I 'm not saying these films are good, but they certainly have something in them to wow you, and I can't wait to start. 1. Interstellar



I feel like I've heard this line before, but here it is once more, with a few different variations in each iteration of the phrase. I get it, you're a sci-fi fan."|0
One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far : The story hesitates between a silly thriller and a classic. There is nothing that can really be compared to this film and it is very sad that it made only $100,000 at the box office despite being well received by many movie fans. I feel sorry for the writer as well who had a hard time writing the movie, I just hope he has a great future. I think the worst part about the movie is the writing style, the screenplay is just stupid.|0
See Dick work.See Jane work.Dick and Jane are married.They are successful.They have a son . They have a nice house.They live a happy and contented life.They get married and have a baby.He is the father of their son and she is the mother of his son.They are happy.They live a happy, contented family life.They get a promotion.They become very successful and are financially secure.They are financially secure.Their life is very happy. They got a nice house and they have lots of money. How is their family life? What was their job before? How is their family life after their marriage?|0
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included).|1
"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister."|1
Piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . I thought the game would be similar to the original game where the main story is about the white people's fight for power over other races , I guess it wasnt . Its kind of like they decided they wanted to take away the white people's power by taking all of the other races down to be slaves or something . I hope the game doesn't take too long to come out , you know what it takes to get a video game to release in 2012 .|0
"This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying ""everyone has a box"" which he put his personal things into."|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is , if you 're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie . it's not , at least not initially - and it's actually rather amusing . what it is , though, is quite a weird and wonderful little film that has a story to tell . it tells its story in a manner very reminiscent of the work of writer/director/actor/musician John Carpenter , who also made a lot of really weird and unusual films in the mid '80s and '90s , but who seems to have come to a much more comfortable and natural place .|0
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster ( though it might be interesting to note that it is a rip-off, the original is from France, but the French company that is releasing the film wants to use it in North America, while the Italians want to sell it under a different name). But it has a few things going for it that make it better than the original. Most of all, it looks great, and as it turns out, the Italians did an excellent job with it (even if it is still a rip-off).|0
"I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . And the only good thing I have from it is it´s story line . Why do they need to do this ? I can see that the more people that want it the better . And that´s what happened here . I wish they would try to make it real . But this way I think they just make it look good . You have to understand that the more people that see it, the more people want it . __________________

"In a world full of films -- like ""You Got Served"" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. Ron Hall's ""Vampire Assassins"" does more than cheese you off. It KNOWS that you are mad at it. First: there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: The location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. It's up to you.)."|1
I 'm racking my brain , but I ca n't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley. Maybe I've forgotten something. But, I remember reading a few months back that you could find The Valley online for a small donation. So, I was thinking , maybe I could write a book about it. What do you think of that? Maybe I can write an article? And, I'm thinking that, as long as I can get the money, I have a chance. But, if not, that's ok too.|0
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course, I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book's author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters.|1
This is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. Added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie.|1
Not really worth a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there... Bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. At firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... However all this changes... and you still won't care.|1
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. Sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridicious.I have seen bad acting in my day but this is NO acting. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. I hate to see his fan club.|1
Personally, I have no problem with the acting, nor the script. I do have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Plain and simple.One's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. What were they thinking!? Budget be damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke.Of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. Oh well. What is done is done.|1
"A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. I especially ""Liked"" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to conservation of the environment. Kyoto, anyone?? And the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... This is why people think Americans have no culture. That, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to Europe to ""see the world"" (i.e."|1
"I saw this originally on Channel 4 ( UK ) and it was a fantastic film that left a great legacy for the industry. It should have a wider release and be watched by as many people as possible as this is just the sort of thing I hope they’re planning on doing with the film in terms of making the content available to as many people as possible. I also recommend it highly for anyone that hasn’t seen it before. Here are some links that I’d recommend you watch:

This is the documentary that has inspired many others."|0
I tried to give this show a chance , but it really does n't sit well with me . Although I do understand why they did it , I just really wish they could change the subject . What's really unfortunate is that I think this show has become a big joke for fans and I feel so sorry for those who are still looking forward for it to continue . I can't say I am a big fan , I just really hope they don't take this series down . I guess it's better to let it grow and grow stronger .|0
Loosely based on actual events , `` River 's Edge '' is a film , much in the style of the 1970s horror films of George Romero or James Cameron , that follows a group of characters as they travel around a post-apocalyptic landscape, trying to survive the coming attack. The film starts off with a group of mercenaries (who have been hired by two other gangs to attack and kill the three survivors of a previous gang attack) fighting a group of men on horses. We see the group fight with swords, spears, and various other implements.|0
I can not believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage ! The acting was so poor , my friend was not even there to watch it and i was like, what are you doing ! I don't know what was wrong with them, but it's all in the past, and what else can I do ? Well, it was a bit late now, I had just returned from France, and my friend had told me I could come and watch an American film. I came and went. I have seen so many American films in the past but this one was a piece of crap.|0
This is on my TV right now ... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this picture. It’s not going to be the final one, but it will give me a great opportunity to talk about some things I think we should all be doing. We all know it’s important to eat healthy, but what else do you do when you can’t cook your own food? Here’s what I’d love to do with my time at the end of the month, and the first thing I would do is make a list.|0
"This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe:

“I’ve seen the future…and I know a lot of people are about to die in a big way today.”

In the 1960s, this horror film became a big hit in horror movies and became an inspiration for the likes of J.G. Farrell and Jules Engel. After it was originally released in 1964, the plot of The Thing was changed from a “monster story” to a “fictionalized tale” in the film’s original trailer."|0
The pace of this movie is quite slow . It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China ( the movie starts in China and goes to France ). The movie is directed by Chris Weitz, a director whose name is known for making movies that are really well made but slow moving at the same time. But there is no need for any slowdown because this movie is really worth watching, because this is a really well made movie that will leave you wondering about everything going on and will make you wonder what happened before the big explosion at the end.|0
For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.Bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!|1
"What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one.The story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. Like the surf ""dudes"" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about that you NEVER saw them surf once!!"|1
"` Rock star ' is not on its way to any ` stairway to heaven ' category as one of the most important rock stars alive has decided to quit music to care for her ailing grandmother. And while it would be nice to see Justin Timberlake take the reins again, it's not likely to happen just yet. For his part, Timberlake recently admitted that he is not as happy as he used to be as a music star. ""I used to be really great, and then I used to be super great,"" the ""Pitch Perfect 2"" creator said on his Facebook page."|0
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild ' is a dull slasher flick . Yes , it have some good point , but is not that bad . If you are looking for an entertaining horror movie for the Halloween eve , then you have reached the right choice . Scarecrow gone Wild ' is another movie which is part of the Halloween night movie line . If you love horror , thrillers and fun , you must watch this movie . You are not alone this movie is not that bad in my opinion , you can also enjoy this film with your family and friends .|0
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of The Demons to beat the dastardly Falcon team who always seems to win at this camp I guess. This being a typical clichéd '80's teen (lame) sex comedy who do you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness. Oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the camp of course).|1
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they have it was not written by an American but by an Anglophone, which suggests it was written by someone who had never before been abroad. It is also a very good movie - the first time I've had the good fortune to have seen it twice in a cinema. If it isn't, it's worth watching once. If it is, then it's a must see for anyone who likes a good story told well.|0
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie , it would be an easy job to put together a sequel. Well, it turns out that it isn't that easy. As you may know, this particular story is well over a decade in the making, with various versions and rewrites from a variety of people, all to no avail. The movie was not picked up by a TV network and re-worked by the cast. So now it's time to see if they are still around and what they can do to continue this story.|0
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction.|1
` The Last Frontier ' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jedediah Swan, a man of honor and a pioneer in the fields of medicine, and his wife Sara. This is the first time a book of the type has been published and we hope you enjoy its unique quality of writing. The Last Frontier also includes illustrations and maps. Description :The Last Frontier will be the first book of the trilogy to be published. It has been written as a series of letters and journals that Jedediah Swan wrote to Sara when he was dying of tuberculosis.|0
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 . It was playing in a theater at the theater at that time, and they were running it. We thought it was a really good movie. And then it became a big-time cult movie. So I remember thinking, I wonder how many times it will be shown this way? But that's the thing. It doesn't really matter that many times. The movie will still be there. We've seen it before and it will always be shown that way.|0
The reviewer in Variety said this was `` overwritten and overlong '' , and I kind of agree with it. But I still like it, because it's a great song. It was one of the greatest songs I've heard all year, period, but the song itself isn't so much the song. It's kind of a slow burner that sets up the rest of the album, and it's not really even a song. I've had a few bad reviews for this CD so far, so I'd really like to know how you feel.|0
Lame . Lame . Lame . Ultralame . Shall I go on ? There is one , I repeat * one ! I am sure that some , if not most , of you have noticed the lack of interest which is displayed by many of the members of your group in writing a review. Well , here is a review for you all ! So here goes : a review . It has been said and I repeat again and again and again that the best thing to do as a reader is to read the whole book. This does not always mean the most interesting part.|0
I agree with all the comments posted so far : This movie was a waste of time and energy , it really should have been a comedy . There are too many things going for the audience in this film, even though they didn't make it worth watching, we did. You would expect a movie to have many laughs to make you laugh, and for you to feel happy and relieved after watching. This is what happens here, you see the funny things, but not really the funny things, it just feels stupid.|0
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of Richard Pryor.I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform.|1
"""Christmas in Connecticut"" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's ""perfect farm"" for the Christmas holiday."|1
`` Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s . A movie that captures so much about life on the South Side of Chicago. In fact, it is one of my favorite movies as a teenager and one of the first movies I have seen since I entered college. But the fact is, it is only one of those movies that really got me interested in African American history that I had never really given a thought to. This is the only movie I have ever really cared about. A great movie with a superb cast of actors.|0
This film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. However, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life, in particular the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8, and World Bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned.|1
I haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie is one HUGE non-sequitur! It is an affront to the noble B Western films of the '30's. I have seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.The bad guy is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches.|1
"Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, ""Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead. ""But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy."|1
George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - he lopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful.|1
A gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's holiday. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...Blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but to little avail. What should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard but that's it.|1
"""You can survive anything"". Anything except a dumb horror flick. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of ""docu-comedies"": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. Some genres cannot be mixed."|1
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on a small southern American island with the backdrop of the war between the Confederate States of America (“old” South) and Union forces (“new” or “civilized” North) and the world war in Europe on the North’s side. The plot is set in the late winter of 1863 when the U.S. Army, under Gen. Braxton Bragg, is in retreat, suffering heavy losses of both soldiers and equipment, and it is winter on the Alabama coast.|0
It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego.|1
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career. I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD.|1
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. Then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV EVER -- I think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl.|1
Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie . This movie gives out horrible messages to teenagers and women. It is very obvious that they had to make this movie. There was no real way to make it more realistic. The movie is very stereotypical and very depressing. I am glad I saw this movie, I was not expecting much at all.I can say this, the only thing I really loved about this film is the story. But the acting was terrible, I think. This movie is for adults only. There is nothing for kids in this film.|0
"This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb , the design , costumes etc are flawless , the postures are solid ,the acting is excellent , the songs are fantastic , the story is interesting ,the ending is so good you wont forget this classic

I have only seen the movie one time, so I cannot comment on it but the story is not bad, just not original. I think this one is not that good, but the movie and its music are not bad and that is the best part of the movie which is the story and the story is original."|0
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again. i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens after that? is there anymore dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better. i love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK TV series she was in about some nuns? i am wanting to know the name.|1
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson . This film is called The Birth of a Nation , and it tells the story of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern United States . I am very proud to say that this film is the first of its kind in the country . In the film, we are treated to some excellent cinematography , a story which does a good job showing what the Klan did , and does it so well , that it doesn’t seem all that surprising to see them doing it in the United States .|0
"The original ""Psycho"" (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates."|1
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant , Russ Duritz , who has lots of time on his hands and can’t settle on just a few things to do for his kids. His wife thinks they need to make it a family thing , so he takes on the family business. One thing leads to another , which eventually gets him into hot water when he realizes he has been screwing the whole thing up. It is a very touching and heartwarming story , and the actors do a wonderful job making the story real.|0
Five Fingers is so bad , that I hardly know where to begin . So let me admit first , I am not a great fan of “Dumb” , but I feel as if it needs to be mentioned. This is just something about “fooling” and “stupidity” which makes it more fun to play than anything else, so that is why I want to make this game. So let me explain . This game is a “Finger” , it is a game you will need to master in order to win, it is not about being good at playing it.|0
Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash . Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her lost dog. A lady finds a cat that looks just like the one she lost. Another lady comes up with another recycled trash to fill the place. She has no idea what she is looking for, but that doesn’t seem to bother her in the least. It seems she is just a victim of our society’s mind set, and that she will have to live with the trash that is her lot in life. This one is called “The Trash Man”.|0
I rented this type of `` soft core '' before , but I can honestly say , I was n't sure about it after all. There is more than one way to skin a cat in this industry. It's all a matter of choice. If you have been around since the days of the Commodore Amiga, you will get the gist. The game is extremely easy to play. The game itself is an absolute gem. Although the game looks a little bit more dated at first, it feels just as polished.|0
"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" could bring me back, so here I am.With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad."|1
The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised : Good campy fun with lots of jokes. Good humor and some funny lines in every scene. All of it. I mean there was one thing I didn’t get right about this movie, and that is the acting of the lead character. The only thing that I thought worked about him was that I would like to be around him. But then I saw the movies trailer, and the actor looked a little off. Like there was a little gap between his head and his body.|0
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement of some exceptional people. I had a lot of fun watching the film and I can't wait to see the new version. I can't wait either. The original Hunter is one of my favorite books ever written and I hope the book comes out in the form it is now. The new version I think would make it great and it will be the best of the trilogy. I also hope it can get a movie made so it can continue.|0
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made . Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero . Whether dealing with day to day human problems, or his own personal difficulties in his life (which are almost too numerous to list here, but check them out for a deeper understanding of what makes him a great person), Moore is a man for all seasons . It was a dark time for Rudy Ray Moore, and even darker times for those around him. His marriage to his longtime girlfriend (Ruth Warrick) ended in divorce, his daughter (Doris Roberts) died in childbirth, and Moore was forced into depression.|0
"Mr. ""Uwe Fail"" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor Directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was awesome, its like a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of ""point and shoot"". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the ""point and shoot"" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another ""Uwe Fail"" movie you will understand."|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery.|1
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth , and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his great book ' On the Origin of

Life . Darwin's theory of evolution of species changed the world . But how? And what did he mean by ""The struggle of man and of the higher animals ""? How can we know? And how do animals compete for resources? It is not easy. Here we present an overview of these and other areas of study in an attempt to bring the reader up to speed in some of the basic concepts and methods of evolutionary ecology."|0
"My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true . I did not have any issues with this film, there are a few problems , but when compared with most of my other films , none of which are even close to this masterpiece , this film is not worth watching if you don’t enjoy horror . I recommend this film to those who do enjoy this genre . (The following review is based on a single viewing of the film )

This film is an amalgamation of two movies that are really different in the way they were done."|0
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie . This one is more like a classic disaster movie with explosions. And it is. I have been watching the L.A. Times for several years, and if you are going to tell me about it I will tell you how I found it and how I thought about it for many months before deciding to write up my take on it. I hope I have not disappointed you with what I think it is. In short, the explosion happened at a busy street corner with several people inside.|0
In his feature film debut `Yellow,' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian-Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. However, in so doing, Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates Asian-Americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. The result? Dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch.Don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `Yellow'; each falls into one of two camps.|1
This movie strayed too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely made it to the middle of the film. Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was trash. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the Chowder Society members either. Hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime.|1
"San Franpyscho : 1 out of 10 : So you want to make a serial killer movie . But your idea of serial killers is too old school . The killer is so old . So , you want a serial killer hero , huh ? I know you want that . That is a good thing . If I can say that . I would . And so , you make a new horror movie called ""The Serial Killer"", a new horror story . No , that is NOT a new movie , that is the way things have been going for the past decade ."|0

This film is the first appearance of Meiko Kaji's younger sister , Haruka , who was a part of the original TV series .|0
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. This movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" - 1941, and ""Heaven Can Wait"" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. The closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment."|1
What can I say ? After having read Herbert 's books and loving Lynch 's movie version , I was looking for something a little bit more in line with reality than what he did. What I was looking for, however, was more than anything else, and I haven't found it yet. As I've said, there's some wonderful stuff here, some of it quite good. But what I really wanted to do was to see the whole of the story, including some of those really interesting things that had to be left out.|0
With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye Kira, this is re-Atonement. This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace.|1
"This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to ""escape"" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute."|1
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. They got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film... Its just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi directed this. I'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film.|1
I tried watching this movie , but I did n't make it past the first 15 minutes . It 's a shame , because it did have some great moments in it . But , overall , I was not overly impressed with it . I have a feeling , that I will be quite disappointed in the sequel . After I finish watching that film , I would like to see a film of the same subject matter . This film is not a remake , but it looks like the same story , but with new actors . I don't know about you guys , but I find this film very boring .|0
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines, and impeccable writing... but that's exactly what I got.Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the show's center and soon-to-be-president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious sorority on campus), isn't exactly supportive of his plans.|1
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it.|1
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that 's the trick . The story is simple and it's well written - it's just an action movie in the style of many others - and there is nothing wrong with what is here. I just find the premise and execution to be a bit much. I really love the style of film, so I think it would be awesome to see a series of movies of this style. Maybe we should all get together and make a bunch of films of a similar style? Maybe.|0
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes.|1
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club ( this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans ) , I've had the honor to be part of some of the most interesting and incredible animal research. One such study was carried out in our lab at the University of Cambridge in 2010. We were studying a group of monkeys and they were showing signs of anxiety. We started to observe the monkeys by using a special device to measure their heart rate. The monkeys had developed an anxiety state, which was indicated by the increase in their hearts beat frequency.|0
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film . His dialogue was lively and funny, his pacing and editing were brisk and precise. It's a road movie at its very best, and this was the third time director Dean Bell has taken us on his own path in his directorial debut, the previous two films being (as usual) his directorial debut. As a film school graduate, director of student film, director of creative writing and currently an independent film producer and director of feature documentaries, director Dean Bell has been making a mark in film since 2002.|0
As much as 'The Beginning ' showed that we 're still going to get `` classic '' x-files , Drive , and so on , I think they will be around for quite some time I'm sure. If you were to play the game over and over in your mind as you progress through it (and you probably should), it might make you think that this time you might actually be able to get some of the game's endings, as it is now. But you might just be missing out on all the awesome.|0
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner . I really did n't understand the guests . I knew I wanted to like this series but I did not like this particular guest. I know he is going to be one of the better guests that I have had on and this is his first series as a guest but that does not make me like him. What I do like him for is he really is a nice guy. This series is so different then most of the other paranormal series. It is a bit of comedy and the paranormal elements are just there to be funny.|0
I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard of it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion.|1
"I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind . The trauma , the suspense is just amazing . I don’t remember the first time I ever heard of this film and the first time I watched it with my dad. Here’s a short clip of the film’s main plot ,

“The world is in a panic over a deadly disease, and a young boy has the misfortune of inheriting it. The boy, a girl named Sarah, lives with his aunt and uncle in a remote town in the middle of the Russian forest."|0
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up in the middle ages without realizing it. In a series of experiments, a team of University of Southern California researchers say they could create an artificial civilization without a central power source by mimicking the rise and fall of humanity. At first glance, the scientists who devised the idea of simulating the development of an advanced civilization without a centralized power source in the year 2100 might not appear to have any good ideas how to do it.|0
"`` Tart '' is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying : `` If you do n't know where your food is, where you'll find it is anybody's guess. If you go to the left you might find it there, but where you'll find it you ain't likely to. You might as well eat right in front of you. There ain't no sure way to find out where you're going wrong. - Yogi Berra.'' And, to some, that's still true today. A:

Yogi is an Indian term for a wise man."|0
"It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial ""wake-up call"". And, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. Such is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities as I have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. So, I was unaware of the majority of what Lawrence had gone through prior to this film."|1

I attended a screening of this movie. It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? It obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. Nice thought to bank on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major miss. There was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best.|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent . The plot has been too long for anyone who has seen it to keep track of. The only thing that I have enjoyed about this film has been the music. I will begin by saying how much I loved the film when I saw it. I was not disappointed. It is a good film, one that I would like to see get a second chance on video. It seems to me there is a reason it was chosen for the movie theater.|0
I'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse.|1
Probably because this is Columbia 's first film in color , the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes, but overall I'm very impressed. This is a good film. The acting is really good, especially the kids, although they are very different from the typical kids that we see in many films. I think they did a really good job in portraying the main characters, but I'm a bit disappointed that I can't tell much of their personal story. There is one thing I didn't like, which I'll mention when I talk about the overall plot.|0
"""Rouge"" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. It isn't a sequel of any sort. The very end, which I won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. This film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story."|1
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! Well, at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys.|1
The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing , in which objects such as DVD and MP3 are no longer deemed “valuable” enough to justify their high prices. The problem with this idea of a value judgement is that we cannot know for sure if a product or service really is valuable. I have no idea whether it is. We cannot measure it, we cannot know its worth, but the moment you give it to someone they have no way to get rid of it or it will disappear from the market.|0
"oh well ... its funny . should have been a sadistic comedy , a lot of horror movies lack common sense , they are just so weird . i mean you would think they would take a little bit more and not be able to do all the crazy stuff they did before , but they still got to do it for a couple years after the movie lol

As I have said a lot in this post, there is not a single scene in this movie that doesn't actually fit into some other horror movie . I am not sure if people who say that this was a horror movie are kidding or not ."|0
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher but was very impressed! The whole thing was done very well with a great script, a great acting cast and a great soundtrack. Overall this is a very entertaining film that will keep you occupied for about an hour or so and then it goes into some slow motion sequences. If you don't like slow motion action you might want to give this a miss. The film is a bit silly but it's not the kind of film you'll forget in a week or so!|0

"I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge."" I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see ""small"" movies about ""small"" people in ""small"" bars that are in ""small"" towns."|1
So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up a couple of films that we're interested in renting. There's no reason we couldn't just order a couple of movies. The problem is we don't know the price of everything so we don't know what to charge for the movies, especially as there's no price listed. I'm looking at this the wrong way and just have to ask if anyone has any ideas on how to do this. We have some pretty big movie going plans for the spring and summer.|0
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper . Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies . It was a bit dated for me but I enjoyed it , I think it's a great film with great actors . I think there's a few more good movies , and some of the ones I mentioned I don't think are great , but all of them deserve a mention , and I think it's a good movie. I saw it in the theater on Friday . It was definitely worth a rental.|0
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. It is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny.|1
"I tried . I really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a 1 or 2. I tried ""a"", but the ""1"" was too close to a ""2"", so I went back to the ""2"" I tried before. I went back to the one I did a grade on before. I went back and thought of a 1 or 2. I was like, ""maybe I can get a grade on the 2, and I just need to make it 4 or 5."""|0
A antique shop-owner in NYC , played by Joanne Whalley ( Valerie Alston ) gets put on a US District Court jury. She must defend against claims that she lied to police about her identity during a search for her ex-husband's body, and to prove her story of a robbery at the store that led to his death. In an attempt to clear herself of all charges, she goes undercover, posing as an elderly woman, and trying to catch the men who stole her husband's identity. She's caught, but she's not happy that she's caught.|0
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle . . . I suppose they have, at least in retrospect. And it turns out they're all connected to a new strain of the genre, as evidenced by this new horror film, which, in its own way, could be said to be one of the most disturbing of the summer. It is a film, in a word: unnerving. The story is familiar to horror fans, but not to everyone.|0
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! But do! I expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot!|1
Wow , I was really disappointed . I was n't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater , but I got there and was so disappointed . I thought it would be great ! But then I started reading the script and was so bummed , I couldn't believe it . I wanted to go see it when I got back from the airport ! That's why I love you so much , right ? Well , don't be so disappointed . We're gonna keep making movies that we think will do well , so you will always be there to cheer us on .|0
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . And secondly , the fact that most people still have not figured out a way to turn this on. I've seen people trying to explain it but they just get sidetracked. And I've even seen some people with no clue how to switch it on and still use the device as it was before. This is a major setback to everyone who uses it. And as much as I would like to say it was my fault, I do not think it was .|0
Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's, there's too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla&The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. Matches.|1
When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake.|1
"That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this ""film"". I couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped.The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. The daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.Thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting I've witnessed.As for the stock footage... well at first one...Wait.Why am I reviewing this film?"|1
"`` The Quickie '' tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and ... well , frankly I can't remember the title of this book. It was one of the most popular in my library as a teenager and the story has stayed in the top three most read books of 2012. Friday, September 29, 2013

OMG what has Disney done lately .. most of their new shows really suck . Suite life of Zach and his family is just bad .. the worst ever . I will go on and on ... This show looks great! I would definitely give it 10 stars. I have always been a big fan and I’m so glad that you guys decided to give it a try. It is a great show. I also think that it’s important that you watch this show, so please share this episode with your friends or family! Thank you guys for your comments and reviews!|0
Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town. The audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director. Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7, I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!|1
This film is just as bad as `` The Birdman of Alcatraz '' . I do not refer to the other film in this list. I do not mention it to be mean. It may seem like I'm being petty, but I do this because I don't like to make movies that are just so bad that it can never get made again. I do like a good bad movie, in fact there are many of them out there. I would love for there to be a new movie every day of the week.|0
As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic I am, I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday, I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.The movie is truly more character/story driven than action.|1

Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes.|1
Love the TPB's but this was a lame episode. Didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has. Looked like it was put together in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was awful. The cast appeared like they knew this was a money-grab of an episode to get to market quickly. I hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me. The writing of this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show.|1
I am not familiar with the producer 's other works , but this movie is a piece of crap . I went to see this movie because it got me thinking about what I had just seen and that is why I am here.

I loved this movie! Yes, it is rather cheap and I'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it.|1
"Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named ""To Kill For"". It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ""ability to sell"". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.Maybe the fact the delightful, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18."|1

Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner . Technically , it 's horrible . The acting is not that bad . The story goes that this film is about two cops and how one of the cops went to a movie theater and saw a film that changed his life forever. I think if I saw a trailer for this movie , I would have called the police. That is all I can say , but I doubt that I would have watched the movie if I saw it . There were a couple of good movies made recently that have nothing to do with the book .|0
As a fan of C.J. 's earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?)|1
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the Germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film.|1
This movie is bad. I saw the rated and the unrated versions. They are terrible!! Now, I know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. It's not funny! Not funny at all!! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie let me down. At least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. And is it me, because Mundae is not a great looking woman.|1
"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. ""The Mad Monster"" is no exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. The filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level."|1
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad , although it is . The odd thing is that it's actually one of the few films I've seen in a long time where one feels the need to describe what's going on at a time when it ought to have been so obvious. This is the film that, when you've seen it, is one of my very favourites. All I can say is that I've never read anything like it. It's a good deal of fun and the dialogue is all the better for being written by actors who know exactly what to say.|0
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic.|1
Like all of the very earliest films , this `` movie '' is very , very short -- lasting about a minute and twenty-five seconds. For those unfamiliar with the term, this is a `` movie `` ( or ``dorama `` ) in which the camera moves on the screen in a specific pattern in a particular order and at the proper speed. There are a couple of reasons that this particular pattern was chosen. One is that I have been told that it looked a little better when the camera moved back-and-forth across the screen.|0
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite . No matte how many times you watch the same thing , the only different thing about his character is he is in charge and that's it . The only issue I have with his is the hair, the only thing that makes him stand out are the clothes and that's it . He is also a little bit slow and not very good with a lot of jokes . I'd say this show is very good . I have to say that this episode was pretty good.|0
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be awful for some reason, and the first five minutes make it clear why, even though they have nothing to show for it. This isn’t going to be an award winning movie because it is terrible. It has the worst writing and worst acting I have ever seen. It has nothing new or innovative that I can see, and nothing of the kind I expect from a Pixar or a DreamWorks. But you can’t fault this movie for those faults.|0
"This film requires a lot of patience . Because it focuses on mood and character development , the plot is somewhat vague at times and there is always a twist and surprise . It's like the plot is a mystery . It doesn't take you away from the movie . The cinematography is very good .The special effects, the acting and the story tell are all well thought out . I really like this movie . Storyline

Earth Final Conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race.|1
"The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."|1
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. Anyroad, here's a few things I learned about Mexico from watching this film.~All Mexican Women Are Super Hot - Remember that little desert town in Unearthed? Yeah, well, this must be it's Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. She'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~Half of Mexico is controlled by insane Satan-worshiping Palo Mayombe cultists.|1
"First off, I'm a huge Bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. I watched every film he made on the big screen since ""Love and Bullets"", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood-blockbuster star.I kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latter films."|1
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar . Great chemistry between the actors makes this a comedy that works great. Gargi Singh (Raja Ravi) is an honest cop who doesn't like to be bothered by anything. In the beginning he gets the idea of making things easier for people, and starts to solve the crimes that happen at the police station. But, he doesn't like his work so he takes his personal problems into his family, which ends up with a family tragedy.|0
"I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBALL player coming to the end of their time in Major League sports must face. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.Overall, it is a good movie to watch on Cable TV or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the ""Dog Day's"" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away."|1
Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. It was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later.|1
"The Love Letter ( 1999 ) : Starring Kate Capshaw , Tom Everett Scott , Tom Selleck , Ellen DeGeneres

The Love Letter ( TV series ) is a 1999 romantic comedy television series co-produced by ABC and Warner Bros. Television.

Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain!|1
"I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."""|1
"I saw this at my in-laws ' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said, ""It's about time!"" ""Yes, you and your family are going out of town, and we want you to be there for the entire thing. You can make a reservation for a hotel room if you wish. I'm sure the hotel would be able to help with transportation."" ""Thank you so much, we will."" We took our bags and our reservations and headed out the door for the drive to my family and our new home away from home."|0
I'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. This was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to Down Below. Unfortunately unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place off station. I didn't care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair. I like Lochley but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. Personally I can only give it 1/10.|1
"'Be With Me ' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie . Just leave it running in the background . chat rooms are full of people that just want to 'Be With' me . This film is a great way to find someone you can chat to and who might enjoy the film . You never know, a little bit of fun might be just what they need

I am looking for an open minded, honest, intelligent girl. Someone that enjoys life, enjoys meeting new people, likes to have fun, who is not afraid of talking to strangers."|0
I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! ! ! This beautiful , charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable main characters and great chemistry between them. From the moment they first meet, these two characters have such strong connection and chemistry that I couldn't put them out of my mind. It made my heart race, and I was so excited to see them together in such a beautiful movie that I kept watching. I have to say it was the best part of this movie. I really felt so happy that they were together and happy to see them be happy.|0
A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with Bugs, his next trainer. If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon.|1
It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe.|1
Well , this film came on on a workday at 230am . The cute little actress who played Billy caught the movie on the street corner . It took her about 18 minutes to realize what it was really about . The story goes that when her mother was working , she was forced to live with a drug dealer . When she was out , he would steal from her to feed her habit . He was a very mean guy . In the beginning , he would do everything in his power to feed her . But , after the first few weeks , he would get scared .|0
Such pain ! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea , but it never fully came to reality in its detail. So when I saw that there existed only two versions of the same painting and that they were quite similar , I was curious to know what was the real source of its greatness ? How could this painting with so many characteristics be so unique? Was it the painting itself ? Or a masterpiece created by an artist of masterful talents ? Did the artist have a master himself and that was the reason for his uniqueness of vision and unique style ?|0
"Ham-handed homage to honest hacking . Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography , until I realized it's actually a little too violent for my taste . Now it's gone all soft-core with a bit of edge to the action , and I can't stand it . Maybe next time I won't have such an addiction ;)

So I've decided I want to learn to hack . I've heard about this site , and I'm kind of hoping to use this to learn how to hack and be better at hacking . So if you have a computer ."|0
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices.|1
"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their ""Silly Symphonies"" series, ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog)."|1
'Carolina Moon ' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe has lived her whole life and now must deal with more than she can handle. With her best friend's help and the support of everyone in the area who is in the know, she sets off to save the city, but with no idea how she'll find the strength to get through it. This movie has a strong message that we are all in this together, so we all have to take the necessary steps to make sure our world stays safe.|0
It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally.|1
A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul . Some , a handful . But there are no actor like me. I like a lot of roles. I have played roles which I enjoyed and some which I don’t even want to remember. The latest one I’d like to mention are a few roles from movies of the last couple of years and also some I have done but haven’t been as enthusiastic about. The first of them is a few roles from the last two years I haven’t been happy with.|0
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews . The script is very dull and the plot is confusing . At this point I am looking for something else . I am a fan of action movies but this movie is just ridiculous . If you are looking for a romantic comedy it is a no go for me . It was a huge disappointment to me . This is just another movie that is trying to sell you on a product but has failed . I can see why the movie has become so big but there is no redeeming value in it .|0

River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of American youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.Much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.This unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in American society.Those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast.|1
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films , Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray , Jeremy Brock brings you this guide on how to find the perfect vehicle. It is possible to purchase a vehicle from a dealership without having to make an appointment, but it requires a bit of advance planning.

He knows when to use the GPS. There are few things that could make him feel more relaxed.|0
OK, so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er, sorry . . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So sue me. I spent my whole Saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. I can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie I'd never seen, rather than read Proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.Which is to say, I didn't deserve Open Graves. Of which I saw none, incidentally. Were there any? Did I fall asleep?|1
With a name like `` 10 Commandments '' you would expect a film to be representative of the account in question. It’s not. It’s a parody of the Jesus story. The filmmakers clearly knew that the film would not be about Christ, that it would be a mockery of the Gospel accounts, and so the filmmaker decided that it would be a good idea for him to use the name of Jesus. So they decided that the title of the film should be “10 Commandments” and that Jesus would appear as Moses in the film.|0
"OK, when I say ""wow,"" I mean, ""Jesus, please help me."" I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. WATCH OUT!!! And by that, I mean watch out for those special effects. There is an amazing number of mistakes. The acting is terrible, but I'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the Sheriff."|1
I ca n't say if `` The Cavern '' is a ripoff of `` The Cave '' because I have no idea. Either way, I can tell you what I think of them, and I can't wait to share my opinions with you. The music for both games has been done by the same person, and I believe it was done for the first one. I would say they are both based on the same idea, but it doesn't matter who did it as long as they do. I do think it would be good if there were more than just these two, but who knows?|0
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... You will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...It really pisses me of that viewers gave Reba 6.7 on their voting...Sure i knew there are some people with IQ lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them!|1
"The cinematography is the film 's shining feature . Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes, and he's brought in some great talent to do the work. The cast of the film are all up to speed with the story, so much that I'm amazed they haven't given up the ghost already. I can't wait until the film's release on October 13 . Comments

This is a decent movie. Although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. It is not typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. I would recommend this movie.|1
Not good. Mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. Some comments : 1. I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything Henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3.|1
Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film.|1
DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, although way hotter than most low budget starlets, is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I ain't trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick.|1
... and I 'm so disappointed because I ca n't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its just all over the place, I really like the series, but it just doesnt get any better when i look at the episodes on net. I just can't understand why anyone would even bother to watch it at all. Its just one of those series i have a hunch it'll be around for forever, but theres always someone else who wants to put it out there. This is the best anime i have ever seen and have seen so far.|0
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field!|1
I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot.|1
The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia 's `` Nine Lives '' comes when Sissy Spacek , hidden away in a mental hospital for the first time, begins to realize that she has been taken over by someone who looks nothing like her parents. After the credits roll, we learn that it isn't her parents who are in question, but someone who resembles her, but he's not Sissy. That's because it's not really her. We also learn that it's someone like her, someone who looks a little bit more like her, and who looks a little bit better.|0
It's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. There just isn't a lot to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs.Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here. He's not one I would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. He's a fine actor, anyway.Everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. That was a surprise.|1
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh OK I'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'Nightbeast' emerges, OK so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people.|1
First, let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.I have spent my entire life living in the Peidmont region of NC. I have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. I have lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind.In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community.|1
"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world .

"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her ""HOOKER"" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond."|1
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.On this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are.|1
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (which means a small game of chess). This small game is played on boards that are called ghils. The ghils are basically a wooden board with two small chessboards placed on top. One of the chessboards has two pieces in it. This is called a queen, and its position is such that one of its sides will be facing the opposing king. The other chessboard has a smaller piece in it, the king, and is facing the queen.|0
Interesting cartoon , included on the DVD of `` The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra '' . I especially like the last line of the cartoon. What did you think of this cartoon, and the book? Did you like the cartoon? I loved the comic book . I thought it was a very well drawn cartoon .I thought the movie was fine but a bit overdone . The animation is really very nice but I felt like they didn't really explore the concept of the character . What do you think the most interesting thing in the cartoon was?|0
I walked into Blockbuster , itchin ' to watch some good old fashion action movies . So i browsed around , and picked up the new Transformers 3, and i was amazed that i was able to watch 3 different movies in 1 day! I was so excited to watch this film, as its my first ever film, so it was awesome . It took me just about 4 hours to watch the whole film , and it was extremely entertaining . I thought it was amazing, as i could easily get to the movie in just a few hours .|0
One of my desires is to be a film-maker, and I just have to say there's no way I will be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watching it, I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed.Estevez's and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing.And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2.|1
"Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book ""Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman"", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married!"|1
A horrendous film , ill-conceived and crude . The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to what was shown in the original, you would never know that she was at the beginning of this film , you get the feeling , she knows she doesn't have the potential to be a lead actress in a Hollywood film , and she is an actress who knows she can't play her role , so , she just plays her role . In her role as Mavis , there is nothing that really inspires you to watch the film , it just feels so wrong , the whole thing is not worth even watching .|0
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don't! This is no Disney film. This film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. The video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'.|1
This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on . But , I 'd just could n't get enough of him, I 'd have to watch it at least two or three times in order to appreciate everything that I saw. I had seen it previously on DVD but didn't know about it. I think I watched it once or twice because I don't remember details. I do remember how it was advertised, it being one of those ones where they didn't know how long they would last and I wasn't sure how many episodes were there.|0
"I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war ""hippies"" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army."|1
First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie, I can't comment on that.However, I DID see the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on that Channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.I've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so.|1
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star, and the Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American Version and a few European Versions, they end half way through Fist of the North Star which is about as far as the movie goes.The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short.|1
One of the best , Lackawanna BluesGreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those movies that you watch when youre on the couch, and then you put the disc in and youre like “Oh God, what was that? !” but i dont know, everytime i go into the theater and theres a disc in there, its just a great time. The only real down fall for this movie would be that it’s a sequel, which is kinda disappointing, but who can argue against that?|0
After the success of Star Wars , there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies . This was one of the main reasons why Star Wars : The Force Awakens was nominated for Best Foreign Film , despite having a relatively small budget . This was also the reason why this film was so successful when it came out . The story line and characters made it a blockbuster . This is also one of the reasons why this has become the second most successful sci-fi film ever . With all the success , it came to a question in my mind .|0
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in . This movie just does not get better and that makes me angry. If it was a comedy , it would be so much funnier. The movie has no laughs it is just awful and I have had to put the popcorn down a couple of times . The ending is the same. The movie is awful. I was very upset and disappointed with this movie , I have no words to say but to the person who took the picture I have lost respect for you , You did a terrible thing to a very good film .|0
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight. I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman. Wishful thinking, I know. Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.|1

"Okay they tell you it 's real . They do n't list any screenwriters or directors , but one viewing and you know . . . you'll be seeing this film . You know it's real right? You should see it . I'm not saying I know it's fake , I'm just saying I'm not sure it's fake. And I'm not saying it's real either, just saying I'm not sure it's fake

But you know what , the only way I could get into this , is by having it seen by friends of mine."|0
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid plotline, and the ever-predictable outcome. About the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women (and the mute guy for you ladies) in it. The leader of the warrior women and Valeria are quite appealing to the eye. But that's about all this movie has going for it.Some silliness in point: One scene, when they start to journey to the lair of the Dark One, they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land.|1
The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful.|1
This is just one of those films which can not justify much of anything that happens . These people are in an insane and twisted way . They do not give a fuck if we think they are good . They don't give a fuck . I have never understood this at all . If you have seen the movie , you should understand . I have never understood what is going on here at all . What is it about these people that makes them act like that? I dont even understand the movie . All I know is that I have seen it many times .|0
Lucio Fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death, a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, Touch of Death starts promisingly enough, but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes.|1
"Imagine every stereotypical, overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters. Throw in a mix of ""period"" music and wailing electric guitars during the ""rumble"" scenes. Then pass the time trying to figure out (or care) which of the Deuces is going to be killed in the (anti)climactic final rumble.I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical, or Oscar-nomination vehicle."|1
"Some movies you watch and you say, ""Well, that made no sense."" And you don't really mean it. You're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical. ""Bread And Circus"" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. From the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. There's no script. There's no plot. There's no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.So what?"|1
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis . Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha . The plot has no relation to or meaning to the real history and culture . It has been a long time ago that I have watched the film . I feel it should have a story that would be more interesting. But this is the second film that I watched that I thought that the director is not an expert in. This is a first time director . I think this is a good start for him. But it is very difficult for me because I have a hard time watching this kind of film .|0
"This self-important, confusing b+w ""film"" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. There's no room for plot when you've got ""visceral imagery"" and ""subtle"" allegory. To me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades."|1
"This is a total piece of crap . It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert . It should be removed and the rights of the artist should be restored to him and his heirs . Please remove it and get back to me when you have the opportunity to buy it. I want this to be the final product. Thanks for your time and your effort to create something that is not as you expected . _________________

I really enjoyed this post . It brought back a feeling of nostalgia , something I haven't experienced in awhile ."|0

I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. I'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't the executives at NBC have any class? I feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story.|1
"If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I am a huge fan of ""B"" movies, and I have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. This movie even surpasses the ""so bad it's good"" phase and goes straight on to the ""so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it"" phase.It is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1."|1
I was rather disappointed . The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins of it . I’ve seen a few Tetsuos in anime, but nothing I’ve found as fun as Tsukamoto . I’m sure the anime will be good enough for someone to keep an eye out for but I’ve seen nothing else that looks even close . This is a good series though. It was a good idea for them to make Tsukamoto as the protagonist, but I like him the way he is right now .|0
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Paul Giamatti as a New York police detective trying to get revenge on some of his former friends. The characters are not real, but we get some of the actors' reactions in real time. I really liked Paul Giamatti. I have not been as invested in the movie as the reviews. I know Paul Giamatti is really a good actor. I want to like this movie and be happy with it, but I will wait for reviews before I say.|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. There is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. Zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. I was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! .............Don't expect anything from this movie.|1
When this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. Soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. Episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat.|1
I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released . Sure , some people really liked the film but there were also critics who hated it , saying that they had seen enough violence in films like that and it should have been more realistic . and , for those who haven't seen it yet , don't let it get between your teeth at a movie theater . now , with this movie , not many people have seen it . the reason for that , of course , is that it was a film that was made in the 1970s .|0
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle . I could n't believe how bad this film was . I watched it merely three times, and I just kept thinking to myself 'how the heck was this so bad.' The acting was bad, the acting was bad . I'm not a huge Tarantino fan at all, but I thought I'd give this movie another try. I figured the movie might get a second chance in the DVD collection after this movie and see what happens, so after this movie is over I will probably just see what I have to watch for the next.|0
All the reviewers are making one big mistake . This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made by a director who had never seen a movie before. I don't mean to sound like an idiot, but you know what I mean. This is a movie that I can never watch because of the lack of any entertainment value. It is like watching something that is just an exercise. There are no story elements. There is no interesting characters or interesting plot. This is just something that happens on an extremely boring set of instructions.|0
It seems to me that a lot of people do n't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on TV. You don't even have to be in the TV universe to know what the hell is going on. And the movie, well, I mean the trailer is awesome! But the TV show is a totally different story. Well, except for this one, I guess. Not a good one. But it does look like Blade is actually some kind of vigilante, so that makes it okay. It's a great TV show.|0
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.However in this American version I found it to be dull, Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore.|1
Just saw this at the cinema . I have n't read the books . There is nothing new about this story. The story of a girl in a coma, she wakes up and goes on to find love. This is one that you don't want to read if your not in a coma. It could happen to anybody and could cause some problems. But i think it's a good idea to give your brain some exercise to help it recover. This is not the last time we will read this book.|0
"""Problem Child"" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue."|1
Deepa Mehta 's `` Fire '' is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic . A masterful social commentary on the state of the Indian caste system that makes it the best Indian film of this decade . The story is based on the real lives of two sisters , one from the south and one from the north of India , who work in the same field. The film was also made in Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu languages . Directed by , who is best known for his movies with his wife Shabana Azmi , it was the last film to be shot with a female cast .|0
Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and judging from the enthusiastic response, he has much to be pleased about. A taught, well done Indy, impressive for it's big budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were were especially well cast in the leads, delivering strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film.|1
"Follow-up to 1965's ""My Name Is Barbra"", and shot in brilliant color, ""Color Me Barbra"" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (""One Kiss"", ""Yesterdays"")."|1
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of WWI. The story revolves around Jean Valjean, an orphaned child who has lost his mother at the age of four, but who lives on with his father, an officer. His father makes his living as a policeman by raping, beating, and robbing. The daughter has been raised by the man who had her mother killed, and has been forced to do the bidding of the father, as well as that of her father’s older brother.|0
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film , but for the name. And for a director to have to do this , is pretty much a miracle in itself. So you’d think he wouldn’t be allowed to name his movie after the Biblical stories that have inspired it. Instead, he took his time and did it right. But it does take a lot for a director to make this kind of name change happen, you’d think. And the question is why he did it.|0
This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust . If it were n't for the needless animal killing in this film, Cannibal Holocaust would not be so entertaining. You have the opportunity to kill an animal. You get the chance to kill an animal and there's a lot of blood splattered on your shirt. Then you have an opportunity to kill an animal and then you want to get even, you get the chance to kill an animal and have an opportunity to have some blood splattered all over your body, you get the chance to have your throat ripped out and that's it.|0
"The sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading character is so dumb that I don’t have words for it, I can only wish that she would end up dead, but that’s not the reason for my dislike for the movie , it’s because there is so much that I despise about it ,

In summary

It is a terrible movie. There’s not much that I’ve enjoyed about this movie so I won’t bother listing the reasons why."|0
I 've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days , and must urge you to watch it, as you may well enjoy it more than the likes of the great John Frankenheimer . It’s only available to watch on the BBC, but it’s worth checking out. For those that’ve never had the pleasure, there’s little more to it, but for those that know, the story is this. On the morning of a big test for the team, it is discovered that a young woman is pregnant.|0
2001: A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things.|1
"This is a semi fictional memoir of an ""international man"" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.I was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However, I was disappointed by this film. ""Chico"" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained."|1
Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema. Here is one good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to the producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who in reality, is the son of the producer of the film. Hence, he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so.|1
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 best of 2008. It also gave rise to the idea that, in a country where there is a long and painful history of social inequality (e.g., racial and class inequalities), the rich should pay higher tax rates for the rich. For some time, there had been much debate in the press and elsewhere on whether this was an accurate analogy. But the fact that Mitt Romney was able to bring it home with this joke at a fundraising event in Florida last year suggests it is not.|0
"The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a complete waste of a great movie. If you have not already done so, you should start watching this. Don’t waste your time and money. This movie will make you sick. Plot

We follow the adventures of a young woman whose husband died in a terrible accident. After he dies, she is left with two little children. She moves out of the house and goes on a road trip to take care of the two children."|0
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women . His name was the same as a witch’s, and I’ll try to change that, I hope I didn’t put too many links on this post that will be lost, so I’m not sorry. I think it was in the 1920s, I’ve forgotten the year or so now, but I remember being quite young and reading it for the first time, reading it, not knowing what it was about, but knowing that there was a lot to tell.|0
"This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before I was so bored with it I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. The premise of ""Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...."" has been done over and over to death."|1
The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling . I won't go into the mechanics of the plot at this stage but I can't help feeling that something went wrong in the first 3 steps and didn't give it a fair chance. The first scene was fairly generic but it soon degenerated into an uninteresting horror movie in which I couldn't figure out what had gone wrong because it all seemed to be going on so smoothly. Next scene was a bit better but again I wasn't getting a good grip on what happened and why.|0
When naïve young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser at Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role.|1
I love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...I thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. I was very disappointed. The martial arts is also suffering. I am hoping to see a more devoted Segal in his future films.|1
Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the first that I think stands a very good chance of getting the Best Film award, even though I'm not so sure it should get the award because of its race. I'm actually more worried about the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences not awarding the award to the best film from a minority-controlled company (and that's a tough one to get out of, but at least the Academy can make that call).|0
lovely . i just love the movie . i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor and i have seen this movie in the theater and i love it . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie is not for everyone but if you like this movie then go and watch it because it will blow your mind away . !!!!!!!!!!!!!|0
This was a excellent movie. I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain. I also purchased the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my son's teachers watch it also.I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it. Thank You, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's.|1

After the couple's tour of the Caribbean they decide to take a trip down the Amazon River. There's no way they can fly downriver, so they take a boat ride.|0
"For connoisseurs of bad movies , Galaxina is a true gem . With truly horrid dialog , acting , and story lines galaxina has it all . There is something about movies like galaxina that makes you fall for a story that is dark . There is no redeeming features or characters that make the movie , great . And that is the part that makes this movie great . _____________________________________

This was a great movie . The acting was bad , the movie didn't work well , and it didn't do justice to the story it was telling . It was really funny , especially when the characters were just being silly ."|0
This movie was boring . Very much like Underworld , only even less interesting . It 's not much of a sequel either , to be honest. I’m beginning to wonder if there’s anyone on the planet who cares. This isn’t a movie about anything at all. This is the first of many sequels of a movie I have never actually seen . Maybe I’m wrong. I will say that I did like the first Underworld movie. And I’m not a fangirl by any means. But I would have liked a more original and interesting movie like that one.|0
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions.|1
This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to . It was such a great movie I went in to see it at the last minute and lost all of the money, even though I liked it . So let's talk about the movie. It started out like a comedy movie , but as the day went on it turned into a really good movie, and it's so funny and funny at the same time, so you can't not laugh. So I'm not complaining.|0
"I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background ""car sounds"" audio just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot."|1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer . Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the role of the young woman who has been kidnapped, the ending was disappointing. After being kidnapped at gunpoint in her house, a man shows up in the middle of the day to kidnap her. The kidnapping continues, and at the end the girl and the kidnapper meet face to face. The kidnapper shows her a pistol, but she is unable to touch it because she is unconscious, and it takes a long time for her to recover.|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the Bone Eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date.|1
"""Solomon and Sheba"" was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when I was a kid: a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that back then ""Solomon and Sheba"" didn't impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I had enjoyed a lot ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Helen of Troy"" and others."|1
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema . Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style and a cast of mostly unknown actors you’ll probably be scratching your head for a while after you’ve managed to get through it. In a nutshell Punishment Park is a set piece of film that tries to take the audience on a roller coaster of a ride. After the film has been shown a few times the story seems to slowly begin to build and the story unfolds in a very interesting and suspenseful fashion.|0
"Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over ""parody"" movie movies which I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs."|1

If you know of an individual who has the potential of making significant mathematical breakthroughs in fields such as probability theory and statistics, please send me your recommendation.

It is important that these individuals should not become experts in the subject but rather have the curiosity to explore this field and be curious to figure out new things. This should be their main goal in life and be an ongoing process.|0
"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one."|1

I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work.The plot is a mixing of Stephen Hawking's Book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends, and Hawkings himself.Don't be fooled; It totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. The blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man.|1
"I totally agree. This is ""Pitch Black underground"" and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. The scenery was great. Had they dispensed with the staple ""alien"" toothy CGI badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. All they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material."|1
"I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive and uninspired play. It was very, very unfunny and predictable, but the audience was very uninterested so I went back to my hotel after watching it. But the theater is very expensive to go to so you can’t blame me. I saw this in Portland, Ore. and had a similar experience with the play. Here’s the link:





I liked this, but it’s not the only thing that happens when a character dies."|0
So unfortunately me and my mate watched this ! ! ! It was showing on a Sky channel over here, I just missed it. I've never heard the band. The album was released in 1993. At the time it was available on CD. This was my first album, although I'd have to say the last I remember seeing it was in the 70s in a vinyl re-issue. I always thought they sounded better than the originals, but they didn't sell very well either. This is the only thing I recall from the 70s I liked.|0
How do I describe the horrors ? ! ! ! First , some points : First , this review should be done in 3 parts , and then I'll give an introduction and explain why the movie is so special, but first , to make it a bit shorter , i'm not gonna go through all the things that you should take in the cinema, just a few points to do the movie review better, so if you feel that this review needs more space, I'll do it , and if not, then let's start from scratch.|0
I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid-90's as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained it power.It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.The movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc.|1
The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is BORING>BORING> BORING and BORING!!! This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film.|1
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. The quality was so pitiful that I couldn't stand watching it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like Chris Hegedus.|1
**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake.|1
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage , I have stumbled across this little treasure . Action , romance , and intrigue . . . I may be biased but I have found this to be my cup of tea . So let me start with some disclaimers first . First, this is not the first time I have seen it , as this story came into my possession through my friend who happened to run a website dedicated to collecting vintage and rare books . In addition, it has a few minor spelling and word problems which are easily fixed.|0
My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it . That all ended seconds into the screening I thought it was a comedy! But it's really not at all that bad a comedy. I wouldn't want to call it a horror film either, it could be worse. There are good scares in this. I think it could be better. I just think they did a fine job of keeping a consistent narrative going with the characters and plot line. I don't really want to talk about it too much because I've seen more than I can list.|0
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind . One knows it 's a horror movie but does not know exactly how to approach it . The main character of this movie is a woman who is suffering from a heart problem . This is one of the movies one has to watch before reading any other comments . If you want to see it you have to start watching it . If you have no interest in horror movies then just turn the sound off . There is not much of it so you have to have patience .|0
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films . I am looking for all his films to have a full synopsis of every movie that he has directed or written or both. He is the man who was the first in this world to be named the greatest horror and fantasy writer of all time. He wrote his first novel at 14 and became a full fledged author at 19, writing more than 40 books. His newest book was the best selling fantasy/horror novel ever and one of my favorite horror novels, it has a sequel that I would like to see.|0
"Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.Directed in part in a style similar to the ""Sympathy"" trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust."|1
I wanted to like this movie . I really , really did . I was so excited when I saw it . I had read the books . I have been watching some of the older movies with my kids . But I was a little hesitant about watching the new movie . I was a little hesitant to see how this new movie would look . I was also a little concerned that some people were going to hate it . But after seeing it . I was surprised at how it came across . Everyone seemed to enjoy it . And I was happy to see how well written this movie was .|0
The Mod Squad isn't a movie, it's a void. That's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  I'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever, seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no-one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike. There is no plot, there is no characterisation, there are no set piece action scenes, there aren't even any scenes as such, just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second.|1
At first sight , I must say already , watch The Contractor , 2007 . With Wesley Snipes too . But as we know he’s in another movie already . I really like this film . The main cast is awesome , especially Snipes . The main storyline is great , and I was really touched by the end scene . The acting is top-notch , and I think the director has a lot of great ideas in his movie . The story is good , I liked it . The script isn’t amazing , but the story is nice . The music in this film is amazing .|0
I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Take about stage presence! There seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away.|1
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter!|1
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily.|1
Well , I 've just seen Buster Keaton 's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle 's The Butcher Boy and-despite the fact that I've seen Fatty a dozen times I don't think I could get through that film without having a whole lot of respect for Fatty. Well , in this film, Fatty Arbuckle is actually an evil-doer. Fatty 's father has a gambling and drug business that he runs down to Florida and Fatty has to work for a living, and Fatty has to fight for his life in a gambling and drug racket. That 's pretty much my idea of evil.|0
"I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found out that this is not the first film to make use of this concept. In fact, this film does not use this technique, but the only difference in this case was that there was no ""bad guy"". The bad guy here was not the alien, this time there was no alien in the equation. The alien was a man with a bad attitude who tried to impress his colleagues by claiming he knows how to use a computer, so they should give him the money he asks for."|0
Started watching this but did n't believe in any of the characters . In particular the relationship between the bakery and the bakery owner. It was very interesting and the plot twists were done really well. I would definitely recommend this series to my friends. I am also interested to watch the season 2. I am looking forward to more twists and surprises. The acting was top notch! I have never been so hooked on a TV show as I have this. I've watched it twice and I can't stop watching it.|0
David Cronenberg 's ` eXistenZ ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism . It addresses the subject matter from a philosophical perspective and not from a political one. In addition, the film takes the viewer on a tour of the film sets. This is an ideal way for a filmmaker to show off his or her talent as a visual thinker. I would rate ` eXistenZ a 7 out of 10 for its visual quality and attention to detail. As a result of the attention to detail, Cronenberg also employs his unique style of film making in his films.|0
"This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the Latin American countries, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a ""dog eat dog"" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a ""no frills"" approach, this movie will get to you, Great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection."|1
"I hope the writer , director , editor , and composer ( and let 's not forget producer ) read this post. For those of you interested in this film , read this :

If you don't already know, it's the most awesome film I've seen in awhile. In case you haven't watched it , it's a remake of the 1973 classic, ""Jaws "". I think it's a film you need to see at least once, and not just in the theater. Why? 1 . It's in 3D!"|0

Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India.|1
Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet.|1
As a Genghis Khan `` fan '' I was looking forward to this movie . After devouring Conn Igguldens epic I came away with the impression that, if this film were to have a similar quality to it, it would be a great martial art film. As with many martial arts films, the acting in this movie is not very good . Not a great action movie or an action film with a bad special effects, this is an epic fantasy with a lot of special effects . The acting in this film is quite average at best.|0
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. It really does grip you. John Paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.I imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but I wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.I think this film should definitely have a wider audience.|1
I've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we just don't need.Rating is a 2 as I wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Dull script matched by even duller acting. I've heard Billie Piper is OK in Dr Who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance!Please don't let this put you off Austen or historical dramas.|1
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker(Scott Bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. During a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one.|1
"Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive order . So, what I am wondering is if I am correct to say this is the same shot in the film as in the first 'normal ' way' , and therefore should the same shots be spliced between the two . And also if I am correct that it is possible to cut between the scenes in consecutive order ? This is the DVD:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119019/
The scene I am referring to is at 00:25 - 00:31 ."|0
"I know it 's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am not sure how to proceed on this one. The story is well done, I just don't know what the ending is. It has elements of a ""what if?"" type story, but without any indication of what may come next (and I think that is the best part of the film, as it keeps us guessing as to what happens.) In short, I think that this film is worth a view, but I do not know if I am prepared to pay for it."|0
There are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. It is the prime example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could get released.Our killers name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?)|1
"Do n't get me wrong , I assumed this movie would be stupid , I honestly did , I gave up on watching this movie after like 2-3 minutes , I guess I was wrong , I am going to give it a watch now , I love this film , I think it is an original concept and I am glad it is not over produced or whatever people think it is about . __________________

I simply can not understand how any Who fan , or just plain anyone could find this awful , lazy, and boring plot to be anything that they enjoy or even enjoy at all . First of all , it is utterly unbelievable , impossible , unfathomable how a fan of any sort, who is even a casual fan, could enjoy this . And if you think about the rest of the story and how all of the main characters act and react , what in the world is wrong with any fan to actually enjoy it .|0
I suppose I like this film as well as any I know ; it is not perfect , but under normal circumstances I wouldn't have minded if I had seen it a bit sooner. But this is a film for those who have seen it and liked it, I can't help it : it's great for me ; a film that leaves the past behind, and moves forward, and the characters are as real as the situations they face. I am not a film buff or a hollywood expert, so this is only a film review, but I would suggest that it is an example for film novices.|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers, Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town.|1
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee 's `` She 's All That'' I have been captivated by the power she has to inspire us with the beauty and power of her own voice. I first saw this on Spike Lee 's ``The Haves and the Have Nots'' and again on his later ``The King of Queens'' where I was introduced to a woman who used her sexuality as a platform to speak her truths. This has since been expanded and re-written into a series of films by the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Spike and many more.|0

The woman is in her apartment and she goes into a bathroom to use the bathroom but she finds that the water she is using has a foul smell and so she turns on the shower.

Firstly , I am a huge fan of crap films . B grade is always good for a laugh . This one is no different , I am sure we all know the story by now. I am a big fan of this one , as I am a film buff and I watch these films for many reasons. I watched this because I wanted to see an old film from the golden age. The film is directed by a British director called John Lenson and it tells the tale of a young boy who is left alone in an empty house after his mother died .|0
"When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought ""god, this is horrible!"" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs."|1
"""Valley Girl"" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of ""Romeo and Juliet."" It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for ""Fast Times,"" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure."|1
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound but would have liked to have more. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapons. Great costumes!|1
"When I think of a 1970s-period film , this is not what I think of . I do n't want to use the term retro , but this is a film so old that I don't think it should be called that anymore . I'll be honest. I have only seen two films of note from this period -- ""Star Trek: I, II, and III "" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" , and I find them both incredibly boring . I suppose they had their merits as classics, but to call them timeless works that are so uninteresting is kind of silly."|0
Just what is the point of this film ? It starts off as one film , then changes track , goes back and changes track and changes track again , just in order to be more than just an hour long film. Well, you can't go wrong with any of the directors. There's something about Robert Altman, with his great films like The Player, Being There (not his best but still a fine film), Blue Jasmine and many others that make them all worth watching. I think it's what they're all about, and that's why I'll watch anything they direct.|0
This movie was painfully awful . Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods , walking thru the woods, and playing in the woods . No action , no emotion . The only thing that was good about this movie was some great shots in the woods. The main thing I thought about while watching it was the acting . They all seemed to get the same treatment . My favorite part of this movie , was seeing all the people , kids, families , friends . The entire family is in the movie .|0
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river as if they are trying to find a way out. At the water's edge, there are no soldiers and the scene is set up perfectly, but it could be any of several things:1) the scene was meant to be shot as-is.2) the scene was meant to be shot wth the camera still attached. (I'm not sure which is the most likely, but both are equally likely).3) it's an artistic license used to set up the shot.|0
To be honest , I did never read one of the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3 of the comics at all , I guess it was that I didnt have it with me that time. I have read both and i must say it is rather good. The first one i read i read and i was not that impressed , i just could not get enough . But after reading this comic i got more interested in it. I am not a huge fan of horror comics and this one caught my attention, I will definetely try this one out .|0
This movie was astonishing how good it was ! The plot is extraordinary , and the acting spectacular . At the same time the film is extremely entertaining, funny, and touching ! The way it is written and acted make it even more entertaining and enjoyable ! And as I mentioned in the previous review the soundtrack is excellent . The score by John Barry is excellent too ! As I mentioned in the review it's a movie about two people and their love and life ; and in this movie this theme is beautifully played . I found the film very funny and entertaining .|0
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie , I think he likes it too . ) It’s going to be interesting to see him try to use all the elements in his game. He should be a very difficult player to play against. He isn’t the strongest guy in the team, but he’s good enough to be able to play with both the forwards and the defencemen. It was a decent match between a couple of good teams, there was nothing really spectacular in it, but a good game nonetheless.|0
I was very disappointed in this film . The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors , but he seems to lack the talent of a true director. The action sequences , the special effects and even the script seem like he took a shot on the Titanic and the ship is sinking . But it doesn't make a damn bit of difference , it's just a movie made for a film . The story line and the acting is so boring that I wouldnt bother with it . Nothing much happens and the script and the plot is barely believable .|0
"SPOILER WARNINGWe've all heard the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school."|1
Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is ... oh yes , `` Graduation Day '' ! All of you who know me can tell you know I have a crush on John Legend , but there was a time when I hated him. I mean ... I don't know what he was, I just don't like him ! So you can imagine how my feelings turned after this video. After all , I can't dislike someone I really love , right ? But to say I don't like John Legend because I didn't even know him when I first saw that video is a bit insulting.|0
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top.|1
"I loved the film ""Eddie Monroe"". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman's. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director."|1
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski 's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it progresses. It's a beautiful film and I love the way that director and screenwriter find the appropriate balance in the third instalment. I have to say I didn't know quite how much I loved it before I saw it but I'm still thoroughly enjoying it so far. In this third Krzysztof Kieslowski story, two of the most pivotal figures in his life come face to face, one with the truth and one with the lies.|0
This movie was so awful that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of trash. I couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. He doesn't just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. He even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything I have ever seen. I couldn't believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early '80's or something.|1
OK , I 've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through his latest two and a half hour feature film . the story is about two guys that are out on a very special fishing trip out of town . one is an experienced angler with a deep knowledge of his craft and who has made it a profession to fish . the other one is a new guy that just moved to town who is just getting into the fish business , but doesn 't know as much about it as his old friend .|0
I'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem.|1
First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is most certainly a film worth one's while, but one is left sorely puzzled at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for whose beyond himself); or was the Colonel not a fraud, but used as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest Colonel?|1
This is no walk in the park . I saw this when it came out , and have n't had the opportunity or the money to see it since. So I am not to sure where you are right now, but I hope you find what you need. I will continue to be on the look out for the same and I can tell you this is going to be worth it. Keep up the good fight, you have some great talent and that will never go away, but until it is proven, it will always be an unknown .|0
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy.|1
I have a 4yr old daughter , and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses , now that my daughter is an older girl she is all about the real princesses . I was looking to find some new princesses , so this movie came at the perfect time . One of the princesses is a little girl who has to keep a secret , she wants to tell her parents when she's older but is afraid of what will happen . There are also 3 older princesses that have to protect the young princess who has to keep her secret .|0
His music , especially what we hear of it here , is very slow . From around the time of the ' 70s and the beginning of the '80s through the late '80s . It took a while to get going . There was a time when I was listening to it over and over , sometimes , for hours in a row . And then, I had stopped , and I was just like , ' What's the point of it all , ' . I started thinking about it again and it started coming back . It came back again in the early 1990's and it came back even further .|0
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.The music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson's.I can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.|1
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would . I was stupid and did this because it was the only way I could justify my presence in the film. But, if I could’ve found another way, it would be a 1 or a 3. However, this film had to do a few things right before I would give the film a 0. Let’s be honest, this may be the first film I have ever seen that did not make me laugh or cry. That is a huge compliment!|0
Anyone who knows anything about evolution would n't even need to see the film to say `` fake '' . You just know that the movie is so convincing you will think it is true, which is why so few people actually like it . This is especially true when you consider how many people do not actually know that the film is a fake . In fact, I think the film has been used as a propaganda tool against evolution . If you watch it , you should know what the film is all about . It is definitely not meant to be believed .|0
The 1998 version of `` Psycho '' needed to be set back in the 60 's , rather than present itself in 1998. But when you get to that point, it isn't quite as bad. For example, there's a little bit more of the 80's in the story. And then you get to something I've always liked in my ''Shades '' stories: you can have two people in this world and then you can have a relationship. In this one, it seems to be sort of a marriage between a woman and her mother.|0
My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this should be good ol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all.|1
It 's the 1980 's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that has the kind of potential that makes it a place you can't escape from, but with enough room for all the adults to come. It is a home that is part of history and has the potential to inspire the next generation to create a home of their own. The home is in a little town that is known all over the world. It is very close to many of the major cities, yet it remains an all-too-familiar and scary town to many.|0
"When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, I was breathless. I don't know how many times I went back to see that movies hoping to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (She became one), but she was so hot! I went to see ""Sweet Dreams"" when it came out because, by that time, Ms. Lange had become a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And she's always exciting to see.I never walked out of a movie faster."|1
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of it, especially the portrayal of its characters. The only two things we can really say about this movie is the fact that all of the characters are completely unlikable, as the movie is about an abusive mother who abuses her children in every way possible. These children grow up and are able to do anything that a normal parent would do in the eyes of the public, but the abuse that this mother does to them is just disgusting.|0
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema . It tells the story of an artist whose mind is torn between his life's work and the pain of losing one of his most precious friends. The film follows the artist from the very beginning and shows how he slowly evolves from being an artist on the edge into a master of his craft. The film tells of an intense struggle between his artistic and his personal needs and wants. The film tells the story of a great artist whose life is shattered by a tragic accident.|0
"- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -Not presenting itself as yet another remake of ""The Interview"", Five Fingers actually is. Alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. In fact, Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level. What I found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted out his ordeal."|1
I'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. Afraid I'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, shame about the execution.|1
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier . Even for a poverty-stricken area like western Kentucky, Wayne's films had a huge following, and they became classics. But that's only the beginning of the story. There is a whole world of Wayans' movies to explore here, and not just his Westerns. For example, Wayne's three-hour The Shootist, with its complex story, is a great film about the complex nature of man. It also explores an important theme of the twentieth century: race.|0
This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride!|1
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie . i 've never grown tired watching this movie . and every time i get bored by the end, i watch it over and over . but that's not why i watch it . i 've become a movie watcher and i love to read book on my kindle . i love the book and the movie . but i 've never watched the movie on DVD . i can tell you that this is one movie i will never stop watching . this is the story of two lovers and this is love .|0
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch , this movie, directed by James Gray and starring a very capable, if not brilliant cast, is worth your time. It's set in the not-too-distant past, and it's really not a bad way of spending an afternoon - though the ending is a bit anticlimactic. It's probably best to skip ahead to the trailer below. The film's plot is pretty simple - there's an old woman who, after having had her baby, is looking for her daughter.|0
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie , I 'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan (she's not really my type, as I don't have many favorite movies or anything, I've seen about 10 or so, and I can't say I love them all) . There is one thing I do know about her: she is one of the nicest and quietest people I've ever seen on screen and I have been watching films for a very long time now and I have never felt like I was getting into a bad conversation with her.|0
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me , and i could n't put it down until the end of the second act. I don't know what happens in the second act but it's awesome. I will probably watch the other half of the movie now that the ending is out but i don't know if it will be able to make me watch the rest of the movie since i won't be able to go back and watch everything from start to end. I hope they make more movies out of this and it makes them so much money.|0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game , HUGE fan . It still holds a place in my heart today and is one of my favourite games that I can recall having in my childhood. It was a simple 2D game that I could actually learn and play with my friends while we sat on the grass of our front yard , or on the porch of our house. It was my very favorite game back in my early to mid teens and my friends and I had been playing it for many years before we came to know the name.|0
"Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken, of ""TheWitches of Eastwick"" and the Addams family movies."|1
"This morning , I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed . I found myself thinking , `` Oh, I remember that. It's not a great movie. It's really not . It's not what you would have expected.``

If you haven't watched it yet, let me explain what it is all about. The movie is called The Room and it is a story about a man named David and a girl named Rosemary who live in a room and they go on a very weird adventure together. And you really should watch it."|0
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama 's brought upon us by Hollywood , this movie excels where many of the others have not. From the opening scene to the end credits, this is an entertaining movie with just a little more edge to it. This movie has just the right amount of heart and emotion and a few good laughs that make this movie feel like one of the better recent films. I actually enjoyed this one a lot more than other recent movies on Netflix and I would definitely suggest checking this one out if you're looking for something a little bit different from everything else out there.|0
A very good film, focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children struggling with this world wide. The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented.|1
This movie has an outstanding acting , by Marilia Pêra , and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco , which was not to be seen anywhere else. This film should be played by the same actors in Argentina. The Argentines have always been excellent at showing off their own talent in films and I had no doubt of that when I first saw this movie. This movie should have been shown in the cinemas of Argentina when it first came out. I hope that the Argentines do see the error of their ways and start showing their films to the rest of the world.|0
"I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.This is an ""A"" movie and I recommend it highly. If you liked ""1984"" book or movie, I think you will like this one as well.This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach."|1
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan 's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx , and what do you think? It's funny that you have to ask this question, because I had no idea Jackie Chan could pull of stunts as well as he does. In the film I wrote about recently, there was a scene involving him riding in a limo through the streets of Tokyo, which is pretty impressive when you think of it. So I figured the best way to show him off was to actually make him ride in one, just to make an example of the sort of cool stunts Jackie does.|0
Here 's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game (which should be out this summer, or at least that's where it will be for now). It is, by far, the weakest of my posts. I've read it once and I've skimmed it over a hundred times. I'm not convinced it's any good. There are only three or four shots of actual violence in the entire post, not one of them at the start, one at the middle, three at the end and one of the last.|0
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). Julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London on its release. However Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not.|1
It 's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS : RED without getting caught up in the drama. I read it from the very beginning, I knew it was good from the beginning, and I know that many of my friends, who were excited about the book also got swept up with the excitement of the cover. I loved it. I loved it because it was an amazing adventure story with a heart. And I loved it because the characters are so well developed. It is full of humor, romance, and suspense.|0
I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out . It did n't bother me that it was not about the island, it was about the human race . There are a lot of human emotions, so this movie had to be very difficult for the viewers . It has a nice balance between comedy and emotion . The actors did their jobs well , the plot was well written , the effects were nice . It was just a movie that I could not wait for . There was nothing really to dislike about this movie , it was just a movie that did not leave me very satisfied .|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and besides Jean Peters in the starring role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes.|1
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie at the same time that it has a dark, depressing tone that I found very interesting, and the story itself is great. The thing I disliked was the fact that there is so much talk and exposition in the movies, and then I find out how the story ends. The movie doesn’t tell you anything about the end because the ending is so abrupt. I liked the fact that the movie is not like any of the other zombie movie I've seen.|0
Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame. Firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would turn up late on set, change the script, crew etc and generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his trouble enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this garbage.|1
Never having read or seen the Bard's original work, I can't begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.|1
I never saw Doctor Who before ( at least not in any focused way ) , so I was new to the show when it first started. I was a fan for many years but I've been watching since it was revived. I still like to watch and I still watch it when it is on TV. It was a good show to be a part of. When I saw this show I was excited , because I have never seen an older version before of the show and because I never thought I'd like the Doctor again. And I never thought it would be good.|0
"and there are not many in cinema history. ""Rouge"" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in mankind and in life. But to say only that may be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces."|1
"This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth . Yet , you never hear the words of the youth . You never hear of the youth in the story , do you ? It was just a few weeks ago that I got a call from my Dad. He said :

” I’m really worried about you. I want to ask you for a favour”. I was taken aback. I was thinking about what he meant and where he was taking me , but was too embarrassed to say anything ."|0
It's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. The paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly came to know it, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. I've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways.|1
"If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the ""bad grrl"" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved."|1
"LCDR Tom Dodge , despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick ( * note to reader: the quote below is from an email by a former colleague *) , has shown extraordinary leadership in helping to rebuild and re-energize the submarine community. After years of being overlooked by the industry, his efforts have brought a lot of new people into the submarine community who want to do things the way he does them. *

*Note to reader: Tom Dodge is one of my closest friends in the industry and I used to have him as a mentor."|0
I never read the book . Now I do n't really want to . I had no clue what this was all about, and now I do n't. It's not as if I didn't know it, but then again I couldn't find out at all. It has taken me years to find my way around this one, mainly because of my own poor writing. It has taken me a long time to realise how much of the book I don't know, not even close to the way I knew it before it was written.|0
Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made `` Bamako , '' but the rest of the story remains murky. It all started in the spring when Sissako, now 26, returned to his native Senegal for a second time, but this time to take up his post as manager of his former club. In his previous stint, he had been given the title of `` director of football and sports. ``I went back because I have a lot to say about our football in Africa,'' he says. ``I have been working for five years with the players of the clubs.|0
"(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with ""Night of the Demons,"" but, you know, they're basically the same thing."|1
"I 'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon . I 've seen only 4 pictures on the web and I 've only been watching for about a week .

We all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. But Raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless Carnosaur series, does not even ATTEMPT to have any enjoyment in it. Its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. Where do we start? Well... the sets are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages.|1
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ . I know the house that it is based on . But I still don't really like this movie . First of all its very slow paced . And the action is kinda rushed . And the only real good character is the lead . Not much to say about her . She is really boring . And she has so much to do with the main story . But I just couldn't enjoy it . But all that I can say is , it's just so bad . Really boring .|0
I went to this film full of hope . With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Richard Attenborough , I was pleasantly surprised with the movie’s direction , as well as the talented and witty performances of the other leading actors in the movie. It should be noted that one of the best aspects of “Shame onletcher” is the humor in the movie . This humor is mainly due to the fact that the movie was shot in a period manner , and was shot on location , which resulted in a variety of humor in the movie .|0
I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, after only just beginning. I looked forward to this show all week long. And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have won. It just began, and in my opinion,it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted, and sat waiting for it to come on; never knowing that it was canceled.|1
Not too good a movie . Sure , it contains action , but the effects are n't all that good . I would say it's pretty good for a comedy , but not so much for an action movie . This is a film that started out as a musical . A musical , but not like the musicals we all grew up with . This one is a comedy . And the movie was pretty terrible until the last minute . If you don't know what I'm talking about look at the trailer and you'll understand what I'm talking about .|0
I go this game and it is alright I guess. I just expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. Also the graphics aren't as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst out of the three.|1
"After a meteorite lands in ""Boston"" (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. This isn't."|1
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and ""the Wizard Of Oz""."|1
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles.|1
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD . Lost is the exciting and fun game. Lost the fun. City of God was great and it was fun, but it's a different kind of fun, and a lot more rewarding. City of men was boring and tedious. Lost the challenge. Lost a great game with great players. It was a real fun time and I didn't expect much from it, but it was a real enjoyable challenge. There are definitely other games to be played that are much more challenging, and enjoyable.|0
Too much stock footage ( almost one third of this 53 minute film ) really slows this one down . not because it was difficult to get a hold of the footage ( it wasn't hard ) but because it slows the action . if you want to have a good time watching this one , turn your volume down as it goes . the one thing I do like about this one is the first thing that I noticed while watching the film . I thought that this is one film that could really stand apart from all others . for me .|0
When I was driving home after work, I bought some movies for my four year old twins. I had bought this movie my kids would enjoy. I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. In this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day.One day, they threw away all our movies.I SOLD THE Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F++++++++++++++++ I rather be seen on the worst dress list.My kids now hate this dumb movie. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other.|1
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days, Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy acting of lead Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it.|1
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i 've gone insane . It was a HUGE waste of time and money . One of my favourite films ever . I have seen all the horror movies that have ever been on the market .I am a fan of horror movies and i have seen so many of these bad films . This is one of them .The film is not very scary , i am not very scared for myself .This is one of those films that will always haunt me because i thought it was very interesting .|0
No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I 've seen in a long while, but I'm still wondering about why he was used to play the lead role. It's not like it's the first time he's played the lead role, as I've seen him in a couple of movies. It's a completely different role than he usually plays in films, and it just seemed strange to me to play a lead role that is different from how I normally see him play. Is there a reason for this casting choice?|0
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s , Italians made so of the best movies , and then all of a sudden , it just stopped? In some ways , I'm not sure that was it . Maybe it was because the movie industry was in such disarray . The '50s , with all of the political and social changes , were such an exciting time of change , and so exciting , that they just couldn't afford to make anything like the same movies as before . And maybe that meant that it just stopped? But maybe it just wasn't something new at all .|0
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie , but I feel this is just a sports movie . i'll admit, this is a baseball movie , which means there are a number of similarities . i don't think the story is all that great , and i don't think the acting is as good as it was in a lot of the other films . there are a couple of funny scenes that keep the film from being just a straight baseball film , but overall , the film feels very dated .|0
William Petersen (that C.S.I guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. It leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or a pick up at the library but not much more.|1
I 've seen worse films . This is bad but at least does n't try to be good so it's a good reason to go to bed early. I also don't know what they're talking about, like if you go on the internet to find that film, and you don't know what the film is and the film has no internet link I wouldn't trust it and would be very disappointed if I didn't have the internet link. You're right to feel disappointed, but there is no harm in trying to find it.|0
I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit.|1
Awful , awful , awful times a hundred still does n't begin to describe how crappy `` Biggest Loser '' has gone through . This is the best season of Biggest Loser in my memory of the show , it's probably the best one season I have seen since the show started in 2009 , but I am going to say it is one of the worst of them . I had no idea what I was going into the season with , but after watching last night's show , I'm not so sure it was going to be a very good season for the show , at all .|0
"I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good , and I watched a video on it a couple of weeks ago. I have not seen it. But this morning, my friend gave me a link from youtube. It is not the video but the link. I am glad I saw the first link. So I clicked on the first link. And this is what I saw:

Well, I may be getting too old. I don’t think it is as good as the last. I still remember this, but I am thinking I will watch the other two."|0
I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver . The screen was three rows in front of us and I was looking directly at it. When I looked down, I could see the movie was being played. I was surprised to see how big it was. I thought they were playing it on a flat screen TV, but I didn't realize that was how the film was actually being shown, as a three-dimensional projection. It was amazing and very impressive. It really made the movie look 3D. This is my first time seeing it.|0
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler), loopy Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee), and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams).|1
I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.|1
I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore.|1
"Dude...I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. The worst lead actress EVER!! Not even David ""Hot Pants"" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I NEVER watch Fox  it blows!! We totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. We watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. I want to kill the execs at the network SO BAD! Why is money being spent on this drivel?!?!"|1
At the time of this writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of Chris Penn. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from.I still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.Anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by Bananarama.|1
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me.|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, that's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people. They couldn't be further apart in ideas.Novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may/may not use him for sex.|1
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and for the fans, and I'm sure it'll be fun/exciting for all the kids to see it. It's pretty cool that these guys are having fun making it. The director and the production crew did a great job. I was really hoping that these guys would come out on top. They've really worked hard to get these kids to work together as one entity, and it was fun to see how that worked out.|0
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor . Geena Davis is a schoolteacher who returns home to find her family murdered, and she is brought into the murder investigation of the case, as well as the search for her long-deceased husband who she has kept a secret all her life. This is the tale that is sure to capture the imagination of everyone who sees it. I was originally a bit scared when I first started watching this film because of its dark subject matter, but after the first few minutes I was sold.|0
"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison."|1
While not truly terrible , this movie is still largely a waste of time , and paints an incredibly inaccurate portrait of some of the worst characters ever in horror fiction. I was not impressed by this film, nor by the numerous others that I have seen since it came out. But, I was also really disappointed at the lack of action here. It didn’t feel like we were given a good reason or reason for this film to even exist. I can get that some of the characters were just bad people, but the entire film just feels that way.|0
This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. If this weren't bad enough, some guy named Count de Sade is living there as well. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. Anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs.|1
!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees .So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ?|1
I 'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book . Given the number of characters and subplots it would be easy to lose track of them. There are a few moments in the film when the movie is a bit confusing. I understand the story but there was so much that went on in the movie that it took me a while to get my bearings. I can understand the characters that we see in the movie. However, the movie does not explain who the other characters are nor do I understand what they want.|0
"This version of ""The Magic Flute"" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera that I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have seen of any opera.I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He is just dressed like some guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVD's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one."|1
"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt""."|1
I'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I could've done without the female nudity but I'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!)|1
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband."|1
Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on.|1
I rented this movie , because I noticed the cover in the video rental store . I saw Nolte , he was not bad , but i did not like the plot , i did not like how he was manipulated . I don't see how this movie could be improved on . I'm not a religious man , but there are lots of movies , where the main character is against religion . The only one in this movie that I like , was , because i was rooting for the guy to be a true Christian .|0
Well , first of all , excuse me for the lame pun in the title . I was browsing for some pictures to add here and found this one . First thing , I would say I have been trying to find a suitable dress for my wedding and this one caught my attention . And I know that is not the case for everyone , but it really is very pretty . And this is not what I am going to talk about . So, I am going to tell you all about it. It is quite simple actually .|0
Sometimes, things should just not be made. And while the set-up seemed good enough, it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror. But the problem is, its not another Saw film. Its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from Jason Voorhees.I lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film. And generally, it flopped in its attempts. True, telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first, but that grew tiring to watch.|1
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their young son. The couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind. Upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous, tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza .|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess . I needed a shower when it was over . It goes something like this . . . I went to work this morning about 10:30. At 11:00 I got to work. I was in a meeting when I came in . I had a very nice meeting with a client when it was finished . Then I came to work . I had lunch and went home and got ready . I got home at 1:30. After work I took my daughter to her ballet class . I got dinner and went to see my parents.|0
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie.|1
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.|1
This is the second movie about 1985 , the other one was 'The Wedding Singer ' . Whilst the 'Wedding Singer ' has a very interesting plot , it can be a little slow to get going . It is still quite engrossing though , like the first one. The story is about two people that want to be married . In this movie there are actually 3 people involved in the plot . 2 are the people involved in the plot , one is the groom and the other is the person who is getting married . The 2 people can be the same person .|0
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all of that... This film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential.|1
1. I've seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best!|1
Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie , terrible acting , cheesy dialogue , and not quite ``in your face'' sex scenes , you know it's bad when you don't like it! But, it is a good comedy , and I don't normally like it when people talk about sex in comedy. The thing is , this isn't the worst sex joke ever made. In fact, it's actually a pretty good one. I've heard some people say that it's a terrible joke. But I say, it's a damn funny one .|0
I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. The second is from someone who has. (Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice.|1
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin. I liked the first part but after the first scene, it was just too predictable and boring. I'm glad I haven't seen the next part but the last scene kinda got to me because it had to be the worst scene ever! This movie is garbage. I really enjoyed it. It's not a great film but it is entertaining and has good visuals. I recommend you see it. It is definitely not a comedy as you might imagine.|0
This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original. 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. This has to be Jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career.|1
At least for me. I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. Also, the singing scene was just weird. I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.As Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense.|1
I just saw this movie tonight . Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman, I thought it would be pretty. But I think it was bad. I watched the whole movie. It wasn't bad but I think it was really bad. It had nothing to it. They made this movie because they thought that it would help their ratings. I think it was a bad movie because I think it made Natalie Portman look a little like she had lost it at the Oscars.|0
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic . Also it is directed by legendary director John Huston and is one of the best westerns I have ever seen. It was released in 1940, and there were a number of attempts at putting it together, and it ended up being released in several different formats. I think that it was a better movie than what was released initially, but I still love the movie as much as I do the first one, which is the one I think of first because it was released so long before the rest.|0
"Not as bad as `` Billy Bathgate '' but close . Try as he might , Warren Beatty just could not get the message through . Beatty finally got through and made it all the way to the final round of the Boston Film Festival on Saturday before coming up short against the first runner-up. ""The problem with this show is that you see it at a theater, on television or in magazines, or you read it on the internet,"" Warren said in an interview from the stage of the Beverly Wilshire. ""You think it's going to sound like this, and it does."|0
The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece , or a lemon : there can be no other. In a similar vein to “A Night at the Roxanne” and “Shame” I’m thinking of a movie called “Stargate Atlantis” that was written as a trilogy of three short stories by James Morrow. It will be released on blu-ray on October 13th , so watch this space for news. I’m trying to remember the name of this film, but I have no idea. I’ll have to think about that.|0
"The Hell's Angels did come out the losers in this movie. Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were stoops to even appear, much less be ""technical advisers"" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. Hell's Angles on JAP bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, ""F$#K Harley Davidson!"" and that if they was smart, they would be riding Hondas."|1
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I 've ever seen. I watched it with my father on a Saturday night when he came home from work and couldn't wait to discuss it with me about a dozen times. It's one of the few that I've seen that has stayed in my memory at least as long. I thought the film was very good and I really like the music. It wasn't on my personal favorite list of things, but I think it's pretty good.|0
If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. At all.4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6.|1
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with no running water or electricity. She’s the alien, and he’s the human, so you know what you’ll have to do — go back in time to the future. But, then it happens. In the spaceship, a time-traveling alien has arrived with a woman who, as you know, is the alien. You might not know that that woman is the alien. You could not possibly have heard the name of the alien.|0
"""THE KING OF QUEENS,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. For that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong."|1
"This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the ""suspense"" of Disney's Snow White, was chuckling through out the entire movie. My first warning should've been that it was in the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But I have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can't fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the DVD, it was actually $3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies."|1
"Before we start, may I say I hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. Why? Because, after I'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' had appeared on the screen. So don't say you weren't warned.Fred Sears might have directed ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks""), but ""The Giant Claw"" is not that giant a film."|1
"This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. ""I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin."" ""We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad."" ""It is nice when we all screw each other."" Lots to talk about! Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions."|1
Personally , I do n't like a lot of b/w movies , but there 's something magical about this movie. I have only seen about 5 movies before this and they weren't all good . I thought this one was . . . well ok, it 's better than the others , but still, not great . The story was good . I guess , if you like a good cop story then you 'll like this one . The story was ok . It was a little predictable and I guess you can understand why . There was too many subplots and some of them were kind of unnecessary .|0
Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow.|1
well, what can i say. WHAT THE F**K? There really isn't much to say about this, really. The only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.ACTING- VERY UNCONVINCING! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Rip-off of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful!Gore- Really not believable. In one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc.|1
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 `` Musical Thriller `` Broadway debut, a production that, like everything he did after that show, was a disaster. In this essay, the author explains why, while Sondheim knew how good his songs were, he had no idea how much his acting was going to turn out to be. As Sondheim explained during the rehearsal period in London:

""I had no idea how much I was going to do until I went to see the show."|0
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while . It 's not funny at all . It has no style . No storyline . And no story at all . It is so boring that it is so bad that the first act is the only act of the movie . There are a ton of really bad scenes . The only reason i watch this movie is so that i can cry for about 3 minutes . And it is the best thing I have seen in awhile . I want to watch this again , not just to see if it is good or not .|0
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills , in an attempt to sell something to you. There are plenty of subplots here , that you’d be surprised to hear about , and they were not included when this movie got voted on in the first place. In addition , there are numerous scenes that can be viewed with a clear conscience, such as this one . I would like to give credit to the following people , who were able to make this movie work, and have done so for the last several years.|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint.|1
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag on and on.|1
I 'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one . When I was watching this movie , it didn't strike me that way . I was very shocked . This was a bad movie I had seen a few years ago . I was expecting a good movie . The way it was done was really bad . I have to admit this is the first film of its kind . I am shocked and disappointed by this movie . I know that this movie will not go down in my memories . It will never make it back to the top . The ending was not believable .|0
I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook.|1
I go this game and it is alright I guess . I just expected a bit more . The main problem is that in my opinion it's really too easy . I can't get enough . The last time I played it it was more like I couldn't win it . Now I can't win , but it feels that there are people who play it because they can win . So it's still a good game even if it doesn't have too many players . It's just not as easy . I just have one or two people I'm able to play it with .|0
I 'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video ' genre. I prefer films like 'Rent' or 'Tiger King', where the story is told from multiple angles. I don't care to see how a film is built, but I'd rather see the film in its entirety than getting a feel for each piece of it in order. As I've already stated, that is why I will never see 'The Dark Knight' as it is not worth the price to me.|0
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie . Instead , I saw a movie that was trying to convince me that aliens were living in my backyard . I could have sworn the movie was trying to tell me that there were alien footprints in my yard . And since it seemed to make me think aliens were in my yard , I decided to go check it out . I was pretty impressed . It was pretty cool . So what are you seeing when you look at these photos ? Here is one of the best ones . Notice how the shadows in the trees are really thick .|0
Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie.|1
"I cannot stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so ""distressed"". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? You should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo.I take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they yelling so much? Why is everyone so mean?"|1
This was it! i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff.The one thing that i hated was that why was Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore!|1
"Jack Higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into ""one last job"" (where have I heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot."|1
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver . He meets up with a girl and her friend who seem to be working in some sort of club and he goes to have sex with her. But then the girl falls for a guy who seems to be just some sort of actor and he is in the midst of getting married . Then the film starts and we learn a bit of the backstory on the wedding of this guy's sister and the girl . We see a bunch of different scenes with different couples doing different things and the actors .|0
Larry Bishop , the Writer/Actor/Director , focuses too heavily on the camera , music , and visuals . The film is very dark, yet the audience will still be very interested to see the acting, the photography, the production design and cinematography . It is a well made, engaging film with very strong themes . The film starts on the opening morning of the new season of The Walking Dead , as Rick Grimes wakes up . He finds himself in an abandoned house , alone , but alive . As he makes his way back to civilization , he is attacked , but is able to run and survive the attack .|0
"New rule . Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea for a new movie idea. It could be the movie idea you have in your head that is too good to be real. If you come up with a great idea that is not even close to an original, you'll be banned from creating Zombie movies for a while. If it's a real story, it can't be changed for anything. Quote

So what does this have to do with being able to make movies on your own?"|0
"Barely came trough the whole movie... Acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. Felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled trough. They even screwed up the sound. At certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. It would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.Oh and PS: I don't know what's this guy ""Uwe"" capable of creating..."|1
I ca n't get over the quality of the score , the book , and the performances . This is a huge let down . I thought the book was great . I thought all the performers did a great job but the book was terrible . The performance at the end was the worst I ever saw . The acting was terrible . It was horrible in the movie and the DVD but the book and the performances were horrible . This is a book I would recommend . If you have never seen this movie before , this book is not recommended .|0
"I will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. Even at the young age I remember thinking, ""This is a Baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. The girls in bathing suits."" Nonetheless I was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! As a thirteen year old I never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously."|1
"Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here . . . . As for the other two countries, I really don't see how they could not understand what happened here . . . The guy is obviously a moron, because you wouldn't even have thought he was talking about someone else in the first place. You would have assumed, as I did, that he was trying to say ""I'm from Australia"". Which of course would be stupid, since Australia is just a country."|0
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them."|1
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular Mst3k fodder usually contains. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer--sure, I'd watch it again.|1
I was looking forward to The Guardian , but when I walked into the theater I was n't really in a mood for theater. It looked more like a science fiction movie than a drama. I don't mind science fiction movies, I mean there's plenty of them out there. But The Guardian was nothing like that, there was no sci-fi at all and there was almost no drama involved. Maybe it's the lack of blood and guts but I don't know, I just think there's too much of that in this movie.|0
I ca n't express enough just how bad this film was . First of all what a waste of some of the best actors ever cast and then a waste of almost everything else. And then there was this :-). The whole thing felt a bit cheap and fake and I was hoping it was all CGI but it looks a lot closer to reality. It really looked a lot more realistic than it did and I don't believe anything CGI ever could. Now I know that I don't have much to say on the subject so I guess I don't really know what to say.|0
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as that movie, “Kingsman”, has been.“Solo: A Star Wars Story” is still better than that abomination.Still, this one will have to be the most talked about yet. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it can be true. I mean, seriously. “Avengers”, “Star Wars”, “The Amazing Spider-Man”, “Star Trek” and all those movies are the best of the best.|0
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful.|1
Realistic Master-Piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I never saw in my whole life a film like this one. First time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction... And It didn't looked like... That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It's the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down.|1
"Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is ""nott"" very good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. As I hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is ""nott"" even worth the bandwidth.Up until the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills."|1
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.Now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.That and no more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood.This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show.|1
While not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys history.Basically, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brains behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie so what do you expect? Mike Love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius.|1
As others that have commented around the web ... I 'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard . Having a bit of an aviation history , I am looking into buying a C-5A. I know I'd like my aircraft to be as light and as quiet as possible so I'd like to take advantage of as many as I possibly can . The aircraft I'm interested in is called the C-7. It has an impressive power plant but I think it should be as powerful as possible for this aircraft to do what it is built to do.|0
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as I could but this one I felt was so below par not only for Hitch's films - aw heck, I'm being far too nice here. This pictured really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carole Lombard, but I have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey.|1
Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short.|1
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz.|1
I loved this movie ! Yes , it is rather cheap and I 'm sure plenty of reviews will be of it too.I saw it a couple of weeks ago with a few friends, it is quite good although I wish it was longer in length ! It has the same cast of characters and a few of the same scenes of course ! The story is really good , I did like it ! The ending was not very good , I guess I did not like it because it had to end so fast ! If you like this type of story I recommend you watch it !|0
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.|1
`` Mr. Bug Goes To Town '' was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced . The quality of the production was never the same again after this . There is also an extensive documentary of the Fleischer productions . I was able to obtain many photographs of Fleischer production in my possession . These photographs are very rare indeed . These images do give you a glimpse of life in Hollywood during this period , but you will never find these photos in any museum . There were many important Fleischer productions . The first production , '' The Girl from Kansas '' , was filmed in 1939 .|0
I actually liked certain things about this game . I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had an option to do it all the time in the first person perspective as well. But it's still a fun experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this title if I had the opportunity to. It's a great game and I hope the developer continues the success they had with the series. However, there are a few issues to be addressed before I buy it, as I'm sure the developer will do as well.|0
I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting.|1
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I watched the manga review in a magazine, I thought it was maybe interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity.OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series have an standard. But as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical based upon the Christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. It features some demons and stigmata scenes... Totally nonsense.|1
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin.|1
"I just watched this, an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his ""glasses"" character on Kino Video's DVD of ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"". He's actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake séances. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are ""lost"". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits."|1
`` Opposing Force [ 1986 ] '' was n't as good as `` Dr. Strangelove '' and it was n't as bad, but you could n't ignore it. It had n't been released until two years later. It was a big budget movie, made for the big screen with big stars. It's not like today, where even if you make a film about n't having anything to do with nuclear weapons you have to spend millions on the big production. And it had to be done by someone who was a real scientist, who had made a lot of mistakes that could n't be corrected.|0
"A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon. The local priest (who formerly dated Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of ""House"" and the writer/director of ""House II"". I loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students."|1
"I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled ""Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op."|1
Fun , entertaining movie about WWII German spy ( Julie Andrews ! ) falling in love with American pilot ( Richard E Grant ) after he is captured by the Gestapo . They meet in Nazi concentration camps and get married - and then they're shipped to a camp in France to be executed for spying . The film is directed by Martin Scorsese who wrote and directs it with the cooperation of Scorsese and his daughter Lisa who co-wrote it with him . The film is based on a novel that was set in France during WWII. The movie won the Best Picture Oscar at the 91st Academy Awards in 1992.|0
"I was so ""impressed"" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try. It is the near future, post apocalypse of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. Oh my! Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is hardly up (or down) to HUNT's level."|1
well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly.|1
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie . This was the first movie I ever watched and I thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, I recommend everyone to have a look at it. I think the ending is very well planned and has a nice message that can make you feel good about your decision. This is the only time I am writing this review, I would like to thank the movie maker for taking my time for me. If you liked the movie, please share with your friends.|0
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought , despite not even having known it was on sale! I was a little worried at first, and was a little hesitant about buying it as the reviews were a bit harsh at the time, but when you see it in the packaging you will see that I was correct. It's well worth the money to see this amazing piece of cinema and to get an insight into the horror and horror genre in a new light, and for me personally I am a huge horror fan, having seen quite a few films over the years.|0
I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.There were other problems.|1
I can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots...oh, the wackyness! And watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp'!|1
"the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career (""there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"")."|1
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential , but nothing more , because boy did I hate this film . the script has a bit of substance , it has some potential , but most of it is so predictable that the audience can hardly wait for the story to start. the characters all do their best , but it all comes at the end , and by the end I mean when we get the final fight scene and the death , which doesn't really help . however , i did enjoy the action sequences and the fight scenes are still good .|0
28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history.|1
"This forth film in the `` Angel Guts '' saga , which at only a few minutes above an hour, is still one of the greatest horror flicks ever made. Directed by Michael H. Williams who was a frequent collaborator and collaborator on The Strangers , the film tells the story of a serial killer who commits murders in various towns throughout England and the film was shot almost completely by himself, at his home. He is a man in his early 30s, known to the locals as "" Guts 'n' Glue "" or ""G. G."" and ""G. G."" to his victims."|0
I 've rent the movie because i 'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i 've got the movie in front. I would buy the DVD but i 'm waiting for it to be a sale or a giveaway. Thanks a lot in advance! If I remember correctly it was only a $20 DVD. I'm sure it'll be a good one. They do have some good ones. Just not as good as the dvd's. The DVD's in stores are great, if you can find the store that sells them.|0
The material is poor .... the script 's dreadful .... the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what is probably a generic, poorly thought out piece of material. You can tell it is bad, because there is nothing in it that really appeals to me. But even if it wasn't bad, I would not listen to this film at all .... and it is probably not for people who would enjoy this film. I don't think people would enjoy it enough to justify a ticket. Overall, it is an absolutely terrible piece of filmmaking, with bad acting and a mediocre script.|0
I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show. And you have taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in.|1
"For once a sequel to ""The Karate Kid"" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process."|1
"Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF actors.Boy was I wrong.The direction and story telling in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production.I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this ""film"" but have to say they were conned.If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed."|1
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one . Paul Giamatti lets it all out . I don't agree with him but it is his show . I'm sorry I have nothing to add to that . I agree on most of what he says but that isn't enough. I don't want to go on with it all . I'm still not done . It's still going to be a good show though . I like that it's a talk show . It's better than most of what is on the TV these days .|0
"I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say ""Comedy"" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows.I've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far."|1
"Two years after this movie was made , `` The Juror '' came out . Do n't waste your time . The film is not good , and is not a "" must watch "" . It is very entertaining to watch but not a great mystery . It does not go into enough detail . The plot is not very good . There are a lot of twists in this film , and it takes time to find them . Some of the details in the film are very important , and they are not explained . It is very entertaining , but it makes you go away from the film ."|0
This movie was so awful that I ca n't even describe it . I was amazed that I even sat through the whole thing. The acting was atrocious , and the whole story was completely ridiculous. I saw this film at a theatre where I was sitting right next to the screen and my heart was beating so fast that I had to turn and leave . This movie was just a complete trainwreck . I am still trying to figure out how to describe this film . If you have seen this film it will be completely different for you ! It was a disgrace .|0
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola 's masterpiece . I was lucky enough to see it a few years back in a screening of the original on the IFC system , and after watching the IFC version , I've seen it a few times in my life so I knew I had to have it. This is the first time I've actually watched it in its original theatrical form on the screen. I will admit I wasn't that impressed by the story or the film itself. I saw it twice and I still don't really get it all that much.|0
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films , but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down . I don't know what to make out of this film , but it's more than just a mediocre movie . I don't know what really happened that night in London , but it's not what I expected from a film about a man trying to get out of prison . I expected to see a man , who has spent his whole life locked away with no way to get free , try to escape his predicament , but instead , it seems like I got a completely different film .|0
"""I remember waiting to be born..."" ""Vision quest that was the American West."" ""We went to a psychic..."" ""I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo"" ""...the place is haunted...""

An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in Death Valley.

"This film follows the life of a great guitar player , who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly. The film portrays his journey of self discovery and growth. This film will be available for the first time in India on 20 January 2019 on the eve of the release of the movie in India

The Movie is based on a true story , that I will be releasing the first part of this film in India on 20 January 2019. This film was shot in Delhi

The film is the story of a brilliant guitarist , who is trying to break into the industry and achieve his dreams through hard work ."|0
"This film has some flaws , and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening . Possibly the film isn’t meant as a comedy or drama, but the story is weak, it has a lot of characters, so I think it’s safe to say I’m not going to watch it. But I really like this movie, so I wanted to give it a chance, and even though I did not love the movie , the movie still had a lot of heart . So this is what I found

. Rating : 4.5 out of 5."|0
Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards.|1
"Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it to the guy. In my eyes, he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.Thirst is, essentially, a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the ""rules"" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with."|1
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much ! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had ! I mean the only way a Doctor can be better than Tennant is by his own ability to make the best of his skills ! Dr Tennant makes every single patient that walks through his doors feel as if they are one of the most important patients of their entire lives and as if they are a part of his heart ! And the best part is that he really cares about them ! He is a very caring and dedicated doctor !|0
"Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste ' is not all quite there ... its so funny , it just makes soo much more sense when you see it , its a great piece of film , i recommend it highly to any one who wants to see it . I think your review is of good taste. I watched it a month ago when it came out. I can't say that I got it exactly right, but I think you are right. I don't think there was a ""good story"" or anything like that, it just had me laughing out loud from the beginning."|0
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.|1
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget.|1
OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. But when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched Ghost Lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. The story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop.|1
"Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now, her book ""Breaking Dawn"" will not be first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans.Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it.She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times, she even acted like she had PTSD."|1
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes . I feel comfortable writing it now , so I am going to go back and edit. I know there is a chance I could make it better. This is the best of the best and it will go down as a classic. I have a theory about a lot of films , the first time you see it, you don’t really think about it. It’s as though it were a piece of fiction. Now you think about the plot a lot. You see it more in retrospect.|0
"I will leave it to my bettors , uhh , betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful game of baseball. All i will say on this game,

A lot of what i wrote in my preview is not really news , especially in a game of this magnitude. What is new here , is the game in general. This is the only team in MLB that will actually have a 2-out walk and a 1 run home run at the same time that will be caught by the pitcher. In this scenario it is not the walk or the home run , but a catch."|0
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap , with only about $1.25, from amazon.com. But, I also bought my DVD for $9 at the store I frequent. But, I didn't use the $10.00 bonus. I watched it over and over again until it finally dawned on me. That I have to explain to my 2 year old son why we watched the movie and why we laughed. It's one of the few movies that we laugh about with my son.|0
This movie will not be considered for an academy award , but if you enjoy a movie that does n't feel like a joke, a comedy, a drama, but rather a movie that keeps you guessing , you will enjoy this movie. The movie is based off of one that I wrote and directed, the one I think will be one of the top 5 movies of the last 25 years. The movie opens up with a group of friends hanging around a house with a girl that we later find out is his mother.|0
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!|1
Oh, dear! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. I wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him.|1
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it!|1
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith ( Wesley Snipes ) finds out that he is an ex agent for the secret police, the Romanian secret police, The KGB. The CIA is trying to get the Soviet Union back under their government. They are looking into kidnapping and killing people. Griffith uses the Detonator to hunt down the KGB for the Russians. He and his daughter are trying to find an apartment in Romania in a neighborhood that the KGB has been planting bombs all over.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriend . It was a total disaster . You can really see it was just an excuse to talk about how much they love their exes . Not a bad movie , just not something you wanna see. The movie had some pretty good lines in it . But the only reason it made it into theaters was that they had to do an after party after the screening . That is pretty bad , but it still sucked . I watched the movie and it seemed like they were so happy to see one another .|0
"I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue)."|1
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination , everything is there in the movie and it is real, so we need to imagine that it might happen, but there are a lot of things that are already there, that can be imagined. That's why there are so many things that we can see happening in this movie, we know that we are going there, or that is going to happen, we just have to wait and hope that the director of this film will do that.|0
This is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies I've seen for awhile. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks from Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the Chupacabra of legend is much smaller. All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. Why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the Chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do OK??|1
Wow , this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends . If you have had a crap day, you can always watch it again because it will get you out of it . I just can’t get enough of these girls , and i think they are going to be the most popular girl for a very long time . i have watched all of the seasons of Friends . i think i am a fan myself , but i just can’t get enough of these amazing actresses . so i decided to compile a list of all of their greatest moments .|0
"This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. I've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. This isn't it. The ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.Here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.1) A posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname ""the brick"". 3) A couple that shag too loudly."|1
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job. On the DVD version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty.|1
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. So FBI-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police.|1
This movie was terrible . You could n't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie . Just like the original Star Wars , there is nothing really new and innovative in the movie . Everything just seems like it should have been a new and original idea . Everything was just done to the exact same style and feel as the original film . I really don't get why there are people so upset about the first film , especially when it seems as if it was the original idea . I think you'd be better off with the first film .|0
"Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie.

"Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a ""crypto-zoologist"" (fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: nonexistent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to trap a Chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Grecian cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to. I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either."|1
This is a romantic , albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites . It is one of those movies where you will love it whether it is your first or your twentieth time watching it. This is an awesome flick that is sure to entertain and please a large variety of moviegoers. It is a movie that I would recommend to both adults and kids. It is very romantic and sexy. The movie will leave you breathless. With that said I must mention that it is rated PG-13. However , there is very little blood , rape , or any of that nasty stuff in it.|0
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the depths of a city full of intrigue and mystery. Our stories are told in the first person, but our characters are people we know and trust. This series is an experiment in storytelling that allows us to tell our own stories in a way that no other medium will. You may find some of them a bit dark but that's to be expected - this is a place and time for the exploration of human emotion, the stories we tell, and how we move forward into the next thing.|0
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good . Let me make it clear, I love this film. I watched the whole thing over the course of three nights, the last two nights at my home, with my wife. After I saw the first film, I realized the story was so good, so well told, so beautifully acted, so lovingly directed, that this film had everything I could want in a film. A great ending, a great beginning, a great film, a great ending, and I cried.|0
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it , but if any parents are in need of some extra help at their school , you can do it by asking your school librarian , who has access to computers, to put the DVD into the school's library card collection for the students to view . If the movie is rated R, the school librarian should be able to put it into the ""R"" section for the movies , but it can also be placed into the ""NC-17"" or the ""14+"" sections as well ."|0
Bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her?|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. Like one of those so-so episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has Something Important To Say.You'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. However, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!|1
I have only seen this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may sound a little bias but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th.|1
"This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in ""Alien"" - and some decent ""he-man"" performances from the male cast. The possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play, ""Blood Beast"" might have been pretty decent."|1
"Yes, it's a SBIF (So Bad It's Funny) classic. With a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely NO even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! Camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. Blood looked like watered-down cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the ""human"" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide.Did ANYONE involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was?"|1
This movie tries to be more than it is . First of all , the acting is horrible . You get so many of these people in a movie and then you wonder why it sucks . The plot is also not really interesting , and the ending is very disappointing . And the music is pretty bad . Even the sound in the opening is terrible . Then we get the end credits , but you can only see part of it , but it's the last thing you want to see , and it's not even the worst part in the film .|0
"I'm not here to tell you ""Armored"" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel (""Charlie Varrick"") and Walter Hill (""The Warriors""). Those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. No skirts need apply. They unapologetically made guy movies. Guns, lots of guns. Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. Their movies were like a sap to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. ""Armored"" is so a guy movie."|1
Pacino , and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker . I swear , I am an avid movie goer and a huge lover of horror stories , so the idea of watching a horror movie with a stinker makes my eyes roll and my face turn scarlet and I am a nervous wreck . Well , I am so glad I had the chance to sit down with the cast of Stinker for an interview! We discuss the story, what they did to create the movie and their reactions to playing the character and what it was like to direct it .|0
"Has this ever happened to you ? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals of films that caught my attention, but I don't find time to read all of them or look through all of the features... I just need to know the title. __________________
This is how the world was made. This is how it is going to be. This is how it has always been. Hey, just wondering, if you're like me, are you gonna be buying any film at the moment ?"|0
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.|1
I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any, I've never rented any, so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker.|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago , and I can honestly say to is one of the most underrated books that I’ve ever read in my life. I also read the book about a few months ago, so I know I’ve read the book. Anyway, this was the last book in the trilogy, and it came out a couple months ago. And now, it’s one of my absolute favorite books of all time, and I’ll be talking about it a lot.|0
Its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... But ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.I like Patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie..... ARGH....This movie is so booooooring, the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING.|1
This movie was obviously made with a very low budget , but did they have to make it so obvious that there was a black market in drugs? It seemed to me that that was a very good thing. There's a lot of things that I can find wrong about this movie, but I think I can only speak to the drug part. I do think that there was quite a lot of money made by a lot of people because there were so many people who were able to buy pills and get off drugs and that seems to be what made it work.|0
Okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. So, does he ask his father for the dough? Nope, he STEALS IT and gets caught. Kids, if I'm ever turned invisible, I'll advance your allowance, ok?|1
Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies. They're all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of Mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. They can't stop it either.|1
"I rented this one by accident. I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ""shameless Blair Witch rip-off"". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. Boring Characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the Blair Witch Project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits."|1
"Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? Is there even just a single genuinely FUNNY parody film anymore? All I see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself ""Sports Movie"". It's the same thing, though."|1
Yumiko ( Wakana Sakai ) , the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman , inherits control of her step-father's company from her adoptive mother. Unfortunately for her, she finds out later that her step-father is a murderous psychopath who has already killed the woman's adopted family and is planning on taking over the world before she is able to get away. Luckily, Wakana is able to flee from the city and is eventually brought to a mental asylum where she meets two other children from a different orphanage in the neighboring island.|0
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen. On a par with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. Then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something.|1
"My wife and I couldn't even finish the film. Truly, it was rather painful.First, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For instance, Augustus takes the ""burden"" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.Second, the camp! My lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this."|1
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid.|1
Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. I don't so I thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. Thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in Season 3, and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in Season 3. So, overall verdict? Just read the summary at the top.|1
"The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as ""beyond belief!"" ""no words can express how I feel about this"" ""This movie will move you"" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie."|1
When a movie 's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen 's younger , less known brother stars in it. In this case he's not. But he does have one other important thing going for him besides his brother . He's also married to the daughter of one of Australia's most celebrated actors , one of the most famous actors ever to grace our cinema screen and one of the most famous actresses ever. That's the first reason that this film is such a big deal. And it's not just because it's about Martin Sheen.|0
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema . In the early years of the Soviet Union there was an abundance of propaganda and propaganda films about the war , but there was also a plethora of films which dealt with other subjects. The following film is one of those. The film, directed by Valery Krasin, is based upon the memoirs of a woman who survived the war, and in the end, her life changed the world. The title of this movie is an allusion to one of the most common tropes in Soviet cinema: the soldier of World War 2.|0
Daft potboilers do n't come much dafter than this , but it 's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything worthwhile. The story is so original that it could not have come from just any old Hollywood potboilers, but Sirk's previous work, The Great Escape, is well known for being a classic. It is not Sirk 's most famous work, of course, but that doesn 't make this any less successful, for this is the only Sirk film which is also set in the present, and so is clearly based on his novel.|0
If there's anything worse than this movie I don't want to see it. I remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blast away any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.|1
Even though this film's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor (and I do mean Minor) character if this movie was suppose to being told by Sally's very own family! I mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history, would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character? His other lover (who happens to be white) as the actual love interest?|1
"A bit ""the movie in the movie"" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the ""real"" one.As any Cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. Can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it."|1
"1931 also presented ""an American tragedy"", the original tale of ""who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl"". this was a truly entertaining film. Babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. Monroe owsley, unmemorably played Babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing Crosby of ""the big broadcast"" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. Ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold."|1
Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I was misled after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. Even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time on this one. This movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera.|1
Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer , Allegra Geller ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and his young daughter, who is sent into a deep sleep following a horrible nightmare. The nightmare takes an unexpected turn, and she awakens on a cold and hostile alien world. The young heroine has no idea that she is in the body of a very different young woman with completely different skills and talents, and is about to experience a shocking transformation. This film was written and directed by the brilliant Leigh Silverman who is well known for writing a number of films for television.|0
I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure...|1
I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series.|1
First the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, You've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed on just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, Would somebody tell Shirley she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it...if there's no reruns of Andy Griffith on.|1
This film stinks more than limburger cheese ! If you find this at a garage sale , LEAVE IT THERE !! I was just there a few months ago , and they had a great deal on this , but when they had it I didn't like it so I didn't buy it. It was in a nice little package , but it was not what I wanted in my garage . I am so disappointed. This was such a great movie. I am a sucker for a classic. I loved every minute of it and I can still remember it.|0
This one's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words, but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen! I tell you I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of Physics and such (at which I've never been any good, in spite of my love of sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter anyway!|1
I ca n't explain it , but I find this movie not only funny , but so enjoyable I feel like I am watching one of those animated movies, I think the actors were great as well, and I feel like this movie was a good choice to bring in the younger crowd, but I think they need to rework parts of it, because I am not sure if it is still fun. The ending was a bit sudden, but it was good. Well, I really don't think it made sense. It was still a nice watch, but I guess it wasnt that good.|0
I'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. Instead of legitimately dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).|1
That 's all I can really say about this film . It 's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and the rest. The movie just goes to a different place. This film was pretty good. I liked all the characters, the plot was good, but the plot and the action was just boring. I don 't think the movie could have been a hit, if they had stuck to just the plot. The main problem for the whole film is the fight scenes, there are just so many bad fight scenes in the entire film that I can't really recommend this film.|0
My grandad gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. What a bloody mistake.Basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.The first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.The DVD case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained.|1
A snore gore . I saw this piece of horrible , stinking , worthless , junk at the Cameo Movie Theatre on the evening of Saturday , July 20th . I could not bear to look at it for a full 30 minutes , as I knew I’d never enjoy this kind of crap in my lifetime . The entire thing was awful . As the story is told in this piece, the Cameo Theater is an old and smelly gas station , not a movie theater. It is owned by a man named Joe St. Pierre .|0
Essentially plotless action film has two good guys ( Fong and Roundtree ) pitted against two bad guys ( Mitchell and Smith ). Fong, a smalltime crook, gets a call from the FSB and is being blackmailed to get money from the US Government. Fong and his friend roundtree take this as an opportunity. Fong ends up killing his corrupt boss ( Smith ) but Fong and Roundtree end up having a heart-to-heart and a good talk. Later they decide to get rid of the corrupt boss ( Smith ) and start a new life.|0
This movie is an abortive , stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. I don’t know that I’ve seen a movie like this, because it has no clear sense of self, just a series of poorly conceived ideas. This film is full of bad movie tropes and ideas that aren’t very good. The film starts off by telling the audience a story of a woman who is a singer in a small town in the south, who is in love with a guy, and has a boyfriend.|0
"A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (""scapegoat"") for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928."|1
"This is almost Ed Wood territory. Yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. And that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that ""anti-matter"" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie."|1
"The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...I first tought: ""Oh No, I don't want the trail that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent killer"". But this turned out to be even worse. Typically in this American film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. I want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. The audience isn't involved."|1
It 's not really about wine . No , Nossiter 's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the entire wine industry from the bottom up. He's talking about making wine more like cereal . His vision is that we end up with a more uniform product, where consumers have a larger choice and are exposed to a greater range of products. He wants to remove the mystery and the hype from the wine trade. We should be able to taste great wine from our own region, and we should be able to know, in a sense, what wine has come out of a given area.|0
Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago the parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried.|1
This is one of those strange , self-important , self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound . It fails spectacularly . what you're going to see is not a study in how to be successful with people and how to win their trust and affection. But more of how not to be successful at this thing that you've got to do all the time. How to avoid being caught in the same trap. How to play to your own strengths. And how to make people like you. The plot is fairly straight forward - you see a man named David who's about to die.|0
OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.Not to say this movie is not without it's problems.|1
"The setup for ""Nature of the Beast"" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Sort of like ""The Hitcher"" meets ""Psycho."" One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems!"|1
"it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. I rented this ""movie"" cuz of the drop ""h.p. lovecraft"" on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver!"|1
I liked this movie , not because Tom Selleck was in it , but because it was a good story , the acting was good and he was a really likable character . I like the fact that he has been doing movies since the early 70's . I would have liked him and his son to have been in something a little more serious , something with more substance . I watched the first 2.5 hours of this movie on Blu Ray at the theatre and I can honestly say I didn't enjoy the movie at all .|0
"This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of ""extras"" delivering a film that turned out to be ""okey dokey"".Kermit's melancholy ukulele number ""Rainbow Connection"" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was beat out by Norma Rae's ""It Goes Like It Goes"". I'll pick Kermit's song any day!"|1
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. Just a great movie for ever, to time limit, just for the entire live, you must have in your collection! This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person.

This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain though, because (unless you've seen this) I bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (That's the original part-not good or bad, just there)! Let me say that I have seen every comedian appearing in a main role, and like them all. That's what makes this such a mystery. The supporting leads are actually acting (although the dialog is bad). The only character that is fairly good is the one played by John Goodman.|1
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other?Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.It's funny reading comments here about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a heel.|1
"Well, at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in America, they now discovered they could simply hire the Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. That's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! ""The Messengers"" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the Oriental countries ever since ""Ringu""."|1
"I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece ""The Deerhunter."" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business."|1
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War. The largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner, the East has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with Band of Brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind.|1
This is a cult classic for sure ! ! It is tricky to follow at times , but then again it’s easy to read. It is the kind of stuff you want to read during your day , it keeps you sane, and it’s just so good ! ! A few years ago , I started reading this book. It was hard to put down , and now I couldn’t put it down. In fact , I felt like reading it for days ! I had to keep re-reading it. One of the characters in this book was the one I most liked.|0
Superb editing , outstanding acting , especially by Epatha Merkerson , and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack . This film reaches up there in terms of technical aspects of sound and music. “ This is the story of a young man who returns to his hometown on a whim in order to visit his dying mother. She has come down with a fatal illness. Upon the death of her husband, her son has been left alone with his father . This is the story of the young man’s attempt to get in touch with his mother’s family . In order to reach his mother .|0
"Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing . Now , eighteen years later, three of those same children, now grown and married, tell their stories

‘Sister Teresa’



From the outside, the convent looks nothing like the picture above. It is two stories high, with three rooms at the front, including the chapel. On the outside, there is little sign of a life lived there. But in reality, Sister Teresa lives a life of prayer, meditation and contemplation in one of the most remote places in the country."|0
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon . This is where the title comes from, as it’s the girl in the book which has not been portrayed as the Other Boleyn Girl, but is instead the sister to Boleyn’s maid Marian. She is actually the only daughter of Henry VIII, but her life seems to be one of a series of adventures, most notably those of Henry VIII’s sister Anne Boleyn. This is the story of her life, so we’ll be doing a whole separate article about that.|0
"Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let 's face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch. It's a fun movie that makes you laugh , but does it have any lasting meaning? No. It's just a funny movie, so why should it be rewarded with any awards? It's all a big waste of time. It's a fun movie

I was a big fan of The Social Network before it was released and even now, I don't know if I will watch this movie in theaters or on Netflix."|0
I just can not emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is . Justthe memory of this movie right now makes my day. I am in awe of the talents of the screenwriter and also the direction of the script . The acting skills are superb. I don't care that the movie was a flop. I love this movie more than the last 20 years. It was so well done, I have seen the movie a lot . I'm sure I can see the movie in 5 years . It's an amazing piece of work . I think I will never forget it .|0
Ineffectual , molly-coddled , self-pitying , lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard . After being dumped by his long-suffering wife Alma ( Liza Minella ) in a hotel room on his honeymoon in Italy, Jimmy's life seems to come crashing down around him, as Carole ( Liza Minella ) pursues Jimmy to find the man she loves in the name of the law. Carole is also looking for a way to regain her lost self in the face of the world's most powerful man ( Richard Kiley ).|0
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the Jon Hall, Maria Montez films which have long since become camp. This one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. It's a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity.|1
"A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island . They are then captured by an insane count who claims to have a ""lucky charm"" and wants to offer a prize of gold, which they are willing to accept. The count, however, is also insane.

He then leads the pair on a short sprint."|0
Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia `` goodness '' in the form of a one-hour podcast episode. It's a great, entertaining, informative show, with a lot of useful info about the games we play, and how to get to them. Here's the intro and a few tidbits about the show that I found out about from talking to Ray. In case you didn't catch this one before, here's what Ray's saying about the show in his intro. The podcast was recorded in November 2017 and you can find the entire podcast at our YouTube channel.|0
This production of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen . Although it takes place in Denmark the story is not far off from Shakespeare's play , I think . The action is swift and exciting and the set up is extremely clever . There is a very nice set of props which make the production stand out . The production is a great opportunity to take in a work from one of Shakespeare's plays . It is not for everyone , of course , but it is for those who enjoy the great Shakespearean work and can appreciate it , not for the faint hearted.|0
Although i watched this film by myself ( thankfully ) , i still felt embarrassed while watching it . I didn’t get to the end and the film was way to slow . But i think i would like to view it again once it is aired in the theatres . You can also see the trailer in this post below. So I have recently watched this movie . I have seen it on Netflix, but I couldn’t watch the movie for more then 1-2 years. So when I saw this movie , it surprised me a lot .|0
Thank God I did n't buy this movie myself ! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of the goodness of her soul. She has been giving this DVD to friends and family for years. I have watched it many times and just love every moment of it... It is a shame that they don't get the Blu-ray out there like we do... It is such a beautiful film and a great story ! If this is the same movie that you bought it from then you should get the blu-ray... but I doubt it is....|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie. I thought that since I'm young and it was made so long ago I wouldn't like it all that good, but after I saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it to liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco was treated during the Early 1900's, by the Germans, French, and even the Americans.|1
The Hell 's Angels did come out the losers in this movie . Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY had the guts to tell him what he wanted to hear . I liked that statement. Sonny was telling the truth . Hell's Angels came out the losers and they have had their share of pain . They were in it to win it but it just didn't happen . NOBODY had the guts to tell Sonny what the director wanted to hear. He thought that he was right . They came out the losers and we thought we were on top .|0
You do n't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it's called, because you've been paying attention to the last few seasons of The Last Man on Earth and The Sinner's Club. The latter of which, as you probably already know, ended with a cliffhanger. That, along with all the spin-offs from the first series, was supposed to be the reason The Last Man on Earth was on the air. And now it is. I mean, come on.|0
Before I start to tear apart this movie, mark you--I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So, I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film.To my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises.|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until fairly recently deciding I should at least try to watch it and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part.|1
"One of the reviewers here wrote: ""Good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. Even better ending. "" All I can say is, ""Ugh."" This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian- considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So, what I am about to say is not biased by the""Christian content"" of the film. I'm not gonna bash it because it's Christian. I am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie."|1
This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects . Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing the boys into the River Ganges . scenes where they have sex in a river , and scenes where Merrin's boat is in the water . The acting is bad too, like most films of its kind . There was one really good scene, and it was in the first half of the movie , where the girls in the school were watching their dad's boat . The acting was bad , but the scenes of father Merrin in the river were hilarious and beautiful .|0
This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.The characters are vivid and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novella. Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters.|1
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick . Sadly it 's not that kind of movie . This is a movie that could have been made in the 70s , and would have been a pretty fun horror flick . If you are a VHS lover and you have not seen this yet , I suggest that you grab your VHS player now . This movie is not for those of you who like horror movies , and would rather be watching something like Freddy vs. Jason . This is a good movie , with some pretty good action .|0
Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters ! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances were, how they brought an audience into the theater, in the middle of the movie, at just the right time. They were a delight, they gave us a movie experience that we didn't expect. I loved the movie and had never seen it before, and the actors did such a perfect job with all the actors that it's very hard to say why they didn't get nominated. The only thing I'm disappointed about was that they didn't make it into the Best Picture category.|0
"Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"" I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed."|1
This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. 'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland.|1
I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest , this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife who become the world's first pair of gay, bisexual and transgender people to be awarded an Academy Award for Best Picture. When the movie came out there were some complaints that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences wasn't fair in accepting the award to the film. Some people were outraged that an award was going to be given to an Oscar-nominated film, which was supposed to be about gay, black and transgendered people in America.|0
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb, so even I sensed something rotten in it's synopsis I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. The Hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly.|1
Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.|1
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman . She gave her rather thankless role not just as Maggie, but a great deal more than that. She brings a real warmth, sympathy, and understanding in the character that she has to play, and she manages to give depth and complexity to her role. She also gets the chance to play two roles. She plays the role of Maggie as a real person, but when we get to see that the character is also Maggie as a character, then we realize how much more depth she brings to the role.|0
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. Sex toys included!There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and/or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for some more glory.|1
Between the ages of 30 and 51 , when he died of a brain tumour , Zachary Scott made 70 appearances for Tottenham Hotspur in the Football League. His career was short and came to an abrupt end, but he was a true talent. For those who don't know, Tottenham are one of the best football clubs in England, they play in the League of the Champions. They play in the famous, beautiful and iconic White Hart Lane, one of the best, most beautiful and most prestigious stadiums in the world. It was built in the 1960s to be the home of English football.|0
"I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through. It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the ""good bits"" taken out. Bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: ""He's hot."" ""He has a girlfriend."" ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" ""No."""|1
"I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies . But there are very few that I would have called “bad” in the first place. I watched this film about a month ago and it’s still sitting at the top of my must-see list. It was the first time I’ve seen anything like this film and it really blew my mind. I’ll just give you a taste here. The Plot

The plot revolves around a middle school principal who has a crush on a girl, and she decides to go out for a date."|0
Leonard can write lyrics , but he sure ca n't sing . Nor has he had an original idea in the whole of his songwriting career. But after the first half hour, his songs have some great tunes, with a few twists. And that's the story of Leonard Cohen's new album. Cohen's first three albums weren't bad albums, but not nearly great. This new record comes out on the heels of one of his most successful and critically acclaimed albums, and is, quite honestly, the best thing I've heard in months.|0
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'The Companions'.|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl.|1
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can be such a bad influence on a kid that is just barely out of pre school. She said she doesn't think that you are a good influence because your mom has you and your older sister. I just laughed at that and told her you are right. She said she is going to tell your mother that you have to stop that bad influence before the kids ever hear about that. I said to her I am sure your mother is like that because I would too.|0
"The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a ""pod"" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film."|1
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. I did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. Am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings.|1
I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from.|1
"this is one of my favorite movies ever ! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust , this is near perfect. i think this movie is perfect because the actors are all so good. i love the actor who plays henry and the actor who plays frankenberry. i think this is a very important movie and i hope it gets made again and i really like it . the only thing i would have liked to see was a scene with the americans at the end

I think this is one of the best movies of all time. I have seen a lot and have seen it about a million times."|0
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of lonliness is the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away.|1
In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film ( imagine giving a camcorder to the main character to do this thing for you), the thing that's really the problem is that we're supposed to take it seriously because this is the story of an artist. I agree. That is, unless the movie is about the artist and the camera, then I'm not going to like it. I agree that there should be a lot of emphasis on the camera and the artistry in the making of the movie as opposed to the director.|0
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it . . . it keeps getting better, and better, and better every time I watch it. I had never read this book until this point, but then I read the last book in the series last week and I think that this will be a very good ending to his story. It will give him the opportunity to go on a new adventure with his daughter and he will be free for the first time in years. I really enjoy the movie!|0
Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting cast.Never saw this one before - am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs over the threshold. If I continue watching, it will be just to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper.But after reading the other viewer comments, I'm not very optimistic.The opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously done in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous.|1
"A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no ""I"" in ""team""!I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie."|1
Unless there 's some huge ironic conspiracy going on , my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this product. As I have said previously, I have not been to this site in a while so I was not sure what had happened and why there is so much positive feedback. I have to say that my reaction to the new product is a positive one. I am not sure I am the best person to judge this product. I have had this product for some time now but I do not use it as often as the others.|0
With its few touches of surrealism , LWHTRB works as low-grade horror , but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it is a bit of a departure from the horror of the original film. As a result of this departure, some may not like it, but LWHTRB still stands apart from other movies of this genre. If you’re looking for the horror that has been done before ( and has been done before , as well), LWHTRB may not be for you. You can check out my review below.|0
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film . I've seen this with my friends and family but it really doesn't seem to fit into any of our schedules anymore, but I'm just glad it hasn't gone away completely. It's fun to see what people like or dislike. I'm not the person to tell you if you should rent this movie or not. I have no clue if they are doing this in the US or not. I can't even say for certain that it's not on Netflix in the US or Canada.|0
I 've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we have to rate as a bit of a classic. Not only is it the first adaptation of Austen but it’s also the only one to feature all the main female characters from the book. If you’re looking to watch this movie now, we have the trailer below! This movie is based on Emma Woodhouse‘s novel and is written by the same person who wrote the novel, Joanna Trollope.|0
This film did not excite me . While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema.I watched it on VHS and found it very interesting. There were a bunch of different stories with a lot of suspense and a good amount of humour.I didn't get to see the ending. It was very dark and disturbing. I can see why this would appeal to those with a strong stomach.I don't plan on returning anytime soon. This movie was definitely a very good watch for me.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching suspense,horror and comedy films.|0
I rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.The plot... there is no plot. Everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog could've done better. The special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. And the cheesy lines.... I mean, why even bother? The only credit I can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes.|1
"""What Alice Found"" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who'd seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity."|1
"I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted to be a solid action movie. There was more than enough of it but it was still a bit boring. The story and characters are good and there were some great moments, but the way that it was written was not memorable. I've never seen that kind of ""action"" and I certainly wasn't sold on the whole action-film thing. So I guess I'll be looking for something else when I find that out for myself. It's not terrible."|0
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the Marx Brothers. And trust me, they are paid.As creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really have faith in this turkey. Rather, I think THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate STUDIO 60, which previously graced the peacock network's Monday night lineup.|1
Having lived in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula ( 30 miles from Escanaba ) in the mid-1990s , I was eager to get back to Michigan after several years living in the east. My husband and I decided that we would move into Michigan because it was the first place we'd visited since we'd lived in the Midwest. It seemed like an opportunity we couldn't turn down. When we arrived, we were excited to see how little I had missed in my old home state. It seemed like all I could do was stare at it.|0
Although it was dark , depressing , and at times hard to watch , You Are Alone held my attention for a solid four hours. I was surprised by how dark it was in the beginning but it got better with time. I think you can tell why the film has been a box office flop, but it is still worth watching just for the characters. The ending was very predictable and I can't say that I am surprised by it. This is the story about a man who gets involved in a criminal organization.|0
Sometimes , things should just not be made . And while the set-up seemed good enough , it proceeds to be a bit of a nightmare . This is the setup in which I am using. I am currently using a 4.2GHz 64-bit processor, with the i5-2500k and 8GB RAM . After some research on the Internet , it seems that I should only need to use 4GB of ram ( 4.3GB for the i7-3530K ) . This is the only thing that makes sense to use . Then , there are the graphics cards I will be using. As I mentioned, I already have the i7-4770HQ for testing purposes .|0
Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car. There is nothing wrong with this female hero that I can see in this film. I love female super heroes that wear tights and drive cars. I’ll admit that I can’t quite remember when I first saw this. I was probably ten or so when it came out. When I first saw the film I was absolutely blown away. I mean, what was she doing out there driving a car? I’m still blown away at this moment.|0
"In Thailand, the Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins to a clan of ""good"" vampires leaded by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from the claws of Niran.I expected that ""Vampires: The Turning"" were a good movie."|1
"""Catchfire"" or ""Backtrack"" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point. Why did she agree to do this? I don't know.The hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.Worst of all, this film features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open."|1
I must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of Camp Blood.Camp Blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.The DVD was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.Don't do what I did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.|1
"Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called ""Half Empty."" I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest Sequel, or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies, we go to be entertained  and ""Half Empty"" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it."|1
"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . With a script that doesn't do much else besides say that it wants to tell a story that is ""sad,"" it makes for a really poor effort . I'm not the target audience; it's more a film for the younger crowd who might like an interesting horror film . But that doesn't make it a bad film . And I do find it kind of sad . The entire movie seems to be about a man who gets lost at sea and gets into a very creepy situation ."|0
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening , thinking there would be at least 4 people watching and maybe a few others watching in a couple of weeks as well. And I can’t blame them. But my son and I have never watched football before. So, we were really excited to get into it. It was the first football game I have ever watched, ever. We didn’t know the score but we figured that would be the game we had to sit through at that point.|0
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the original, but it looks like they're trying to use a lot of this stuff to tie the original into the original and give this a cohesive feel. There's a lot of things that tie together, including a little bit that seems to be an homage to the original, some of the original characters that we see in the original still have roles in the film, and there's a scene that I think ties the whole thing together that I don't think you'd normally get from the remake.|0
"I probably have to blame myselfbut I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title ""Black Dragons"" and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one."|1
I 've watched the movie actually several times . And what i want to say about it is the only reason why it didnt work for me was the ending . The movie was good enough but i did not get to the end . Maybe it was not a good ending but still i think you need to add more than 1 year between them . That is all i can say ... The movie was good enough and if you like action like the movie it will be just ok . If you dont , then watch this film . I watched the same movie 3-5 times.|0
The plot for Black Mama White Mama , revolves around two female inmates , at a women 's prison in Mississippi, who are friends with an inmate. The story begins when a prisoner, who is having a rough day at the jail, visits the friend, who tells him that he is having a hard time adjusting. When he talks about what happened to his family during the war, he tells the inmate that he was raped by a white woman at a local church. He explains this to the inmate, when the friend asks what he was thinking.|0
If this movie would have been in English, all critics would have trashed it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. After the movie I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla!|1
So , it 's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie ... all you want is something to eat , something to drink , something to do ... I don 't know , something to kill time ... you have nothing to do , right ... right ? I mean , I got everything I want right here at home ... just nothing to do ... yeah ... I 'll tell you what , you got everything you could ever want . I 'll show you everything I want . You got nothing to do with me .. You got nothing to do , do with yourself ...|0
Now , the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films ( House of the dead 2 , etc..) and it's been a while since I've seen one of their films. But the company is starting to really make a name for itself in the horror world, and with this film, I was really hoping they would make something better than a 3 1/2 hour horror film. I'm very disappointed, because for the first time in awhile I feel like I can actually enjoy a horror movie.|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic . Anyroad , here is one of those pictures. This one was a few weeks ago and it made the rounds on the boards and I’ve had a few friends ask me if it would be too much for you . I was thinking about it and it seems it could be too much for me , but I can see where someone else might want to do it . That’s actually not too bad, but it does look a bit too much.|0
Well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. Instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.|1
"MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood. No major stars show up--we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). The movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. The only things that save this from being a total disaster are Laurel & Hardy's ""battle"" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful color Disney cartoon called ""The Hot Chocolate Soldier"". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost."|1
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb.|1
"That 's a weird , weird movie and does n't deserve a better mark than David Lynch 's one ! I 'm sure you'll love it, if for no other reason than it is so different from your everyday films, so you can enjoy it . But even better, I 'm sure you can find a way to make it your new favourite , so you can make the movie your new 'go to' . Friday, January 14, 2009

This is another movie that I have to watch , even though I had seen it before and thought I had seen the entire movie ."|0
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely . The story is a little weird, the characters seem a little flat, and the acting is all over the place. But for all the problems, I enjoyed the film. What I did enjoy about this movie was that it was a bit of a family comedy. You have a bunch of people, and you need to find the funny in them all and you do that in some pretty weird ways, which are pretty amusing in this film.|0
David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable , or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks . The first of the Cronenberg films I got a look at was ‘Nanny Diaries’ (1987) , a movie that was made to capitalize off of the then recent success of Wes Anderson’s movie ‘Bottle Land’. The film stars John Cusack in the titular role, as a married man who finds himself the new owner of the house that his wife’s parents had lived in for the past fifty years.|0
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see it.In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project. Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor.|1
Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when Buster orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty, Fatty makes Buster come back to pay, Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in Buster's hat and takes money, Buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, Buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on.|1
"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending."|1
Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with their movies. It's not too dark at all and I love it because of how good it looks, so it makes it look like it can still be used today, but also because of how it was done and it's good to see what people had to go through to get that style. One of my favorite 80s films. The one that has been making my mind racing for years and years...and years, is this.|0
Stanley Stupid ( Tom Arnold ) and his wife , Joan , like to sleep in bed with their heads in the lap of pillows , so I am sure they are very well fed and healthy. Stanley and I have been together for almost 20 years and we are married. We both like a quiet and secluded life with no family members around and I am not one to have a big group of friends , so we are happy with the little we have . We get together sometimes and share a good time . We have a beautiful home , beautiful grandchildren and great grandchildren.|0
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen year old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival , over three years ago . I went in with no idea what the hell I was doing . . . or if I wanted to do anything with it . . . and I sat in the audience . . . and listened to a young Chinese girl talk about her life in the city , and about what she thought the city of Hong Kong should look like . And I didn’t do anything with it. I just sat there. I did nothing. In fact, I didn’t even know that I was watching a movie at all.|0
I like `` Hack . '' Think the `` Lone Ranger '' reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver , a loner who loves his family, but knows that being with them every minute is more important than the money. In fact, I don't think I've ever met anyone else who fits the bill. I think I'm a good guy in real life, at least in the way a good person would act toward me. But sometimes, I'm not so sure. Like now when I was going through a divorce, and there were a few times I thought about ending it over the telephone.|0
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it 's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin . The film's reputation is such that even the movie's directors felt the franchise was over. They had come up with something different and fresh that appealed to their audience, but the film never caught on with audiences and was quickly dropped from production. There are a lot of reasons why this happened. There's a lot to take into consideration in that scene, but one of them is that Hellraiser had never been released in America until this movie came out in 2001.|0
"Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course ""no question about it"" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like ""extremely boring"" or ""nothing happened"" ""a complete waste of time"". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening."|1
I would not recommend it whatsoever . It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater , it took a little bit of time before you could even make out what you where reading . The book did have a lot of information, the one thing that I was a bit disappointed with was that it was very, very thin . The writing was not that good either , but it’s not that bad. The characters were well written, but not the most interesting ones, and that was one thing which I was disappointed by. Other than that, I liked it.|0
This was a great movie . It had one `` sot-so-nice '' outburst . Plus there were some very intense and funny dialogs . This movie is very funny because you can see how it was set up . It is funny to see how it is written because there were some very good lines . I think this movie is one of those movies where I could not get enough of . This movie is quite funny . I will not be going to see this movie just because there is not much comedy . I think you should watch this movie just because it has some intense moments .|0
"I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in ""Tigerland"", and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough ""leader"" character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Flash forward 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose."|1
The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets.|1
"I think ""category 6: day of destruction"" was very unrealistic. The digital effects where like a children's cartoon. The actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny!Please keep the special effects real.I liked the comment: ""What did we do to p.i.s.s-off Mother Nature? ""I don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines."|1
I ca n't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb . This is one of the worst movies I've seen this year, by far. It's just a shame it got as many ratings as it did, because it's a damn shame. I have no idea why this movie was so popular among young adults (especially the teenage girl part), because I can only imagine that if you watched it with an adult you would think the same about it. This is a movie that has everything that most people love and nothing that most people hate.|0
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philip.Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while.|1
This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival . It is a wonderful and loving look at one of my favorite things, motorcycles. I got my first bike at about age nine. I've owned a bike since then. It's a Kawasaki KZ150. I've had some really great memories with that bike, and this little picture captures a lot of those moments. I don't like it, but I still love it. If you haven't experienced that feeling, I highly recommend it. You just can't beat it.|0

"One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many people think the 'Woodstock Generation"" remained important throughout the 1970s; actually, it was all over at Altamont in 1970. By 1972, 'underground' rock or the 'counterculture' had moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black sabbath, and David Bowie, early metal-heads and the so-called 'glam-rockers,' who were all 'peace and love' - not."|1
"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian, but I am learning right now.I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the US etc.But what I have to mention is:In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent. Americans talk ""Hochdeutsch"" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Besides, this is boring.I hope the original is better.The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond film."|1
"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it."|1
Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland 's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - and for the past month, we've been on the hunt looking for the next. We're talking horror - specifically: the kind of scary that makes your blood run cold because it's out of your grasp. But while there are a few good horror films coming out in the United States, the one that stands out the most in this part of the world is the new French horror flick: La Grande Illusion, which was released last week in Germany and Spain.|0
"OK , I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum . That was the main reason I liked her and she has been a wonderful friend and inspiration to a lot of us who follow the world of fashion. I’m not a fashion designer or stylist but I admire what she does and I think her approach to fashion is unique. So, there are two things that I love about these images:

1. There’s a very personal and candid expression on Sophie’s face. She isn’t trying to be something she isn’t in that picture."|0
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen . 219 minutes passed and yet there were not enough words to describe the experience of the game . If I had to sum it up, I'd say it is one of the most realistic simulations of the human body ever created . I do not know how this game was so well received because I had the experience of experiencing something like that in my life . That is all for now ... See you again in another episode of the series .|0
"I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there's a problem. And that problem's name is Casey Affleck. Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be ""exert as little effort as possible at all times"". Or ""why speak when you can mutter?"" Or maybe ""put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls""."|1
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth . Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn picture of the person and it’s too much for the movie to keep up. Then you get the idea that I might be able to make that happen because I was looking into that same thing. Then you find out that you don’t have a budget and the movie never even makes an impact. Then I realize that I can’t afford to make the movie but I could get some help to make that happen.|0
! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt to the ground by an unknown attacker. What do you think of the store owner, who was the main character of the show ? He's dead, but he gets to see a whole lot of life in the store from his perspective. But what does it all mean ? What's his life like ? He also gets to see that he will have to sacrifice his whole life to the store owner, who was in a coma and didn't know what happened to him.|0
It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for `` The Sopranos , '' in that it could serve as an ode to all the hard-partying, high-flying New York City of Tony Soprano. It certainly seems a fitting metaphor for the end of his life and the way he eventually dies, shot to death by a cop who happens to be a member of the local mafia. I guess I should make a confession: my first thought when I saw this movie, and I'm not even sure I knew it, was just how good this movie is.|0
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable."|1
Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program!|1
In general, I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend.|1
Another first: this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Perhaps I'm a bit hasty when I say that this is probably my last Rohmer movie but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought was never going to end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. He struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air.|1
Hearkening back to those `` Good Old Days '' of 1971 , we can vividly recall when we were treated to a new television version of `` The Three Musketeers'' . As with the movie, we watch a group of young men get ready to meet up with the `` King '' of Hearts '' in Paris. Then we see them in real life and they start to get it on. By now, we can tell you the scene. The two boys are dressed up in their finest clothes; they look sharp.|0
What I got was something better.Just like many movies I 've commented on as of recently , I 'd been looking for something like this for a long time . I've seen it with other people and they have a very good feeling about it but I have not seen the whole movie , which is my next point.But I found some of it very good and the others not so much . I guess I have no right to say anything else but this movie is an example of something which I have not seen and I don't want to be the only one who has a feeling about it.|0
After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film , and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out and kill my face off , now I’m even less impressed with the film. It’s actually worse than the original (which I can only really explain by looking at the poster), with the characters and plot being a total ripoff of the original. I mean, if you liked this, then you should hate it, right? However, I’m not sure the film can be blamed on the script.|0
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there . Very disappointing. The dialogue is in Maltese and I was so disappointed that they didn't give the same amount of English to translate it as they did with this film. I've seen the Maltese film and I've loved it. This film, however, did not have the same impact. I can understand why they were filming in Malta because of the history and the language. But not only was there not a translation, I think the filmmakers were not trying to make an effort to translate it at all.|0
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe , challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and tricks as possible before they can take their next trip. The guys from the US have traveled to Italy , Greece, and Turkey to test their skills. Here, we get to talk to each other about all the craziness going on, and how you can use your imagination to add some style to your next trip. This trip was definitely different from all of the other American trips that I’ve taken, but I enjoyed it a lot.|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match ( Mahler 's 5th is gorgeous , but listen to what is going on)

And just like that, the curtain comes down and the stage is set, and the audience can be treated to all that I have ever wanted to see, with only one problem: all of this is happening in a darkened room and the entire set list is a song by the same name! I’ve heard of this kind of gig, but was I really the only one looking forward to it? Do I know who this band is?"|0
"Oh boy . Where do I begin on this piece of slime ? This is one of the few real life examples I've come across that actually has a plot, and that makes it all that much better. So here we go :

It's the middle of the year, and the world is reeling from the recent terrorist attacks in the middle east. As a consequence, the US has been forced to pull out of the war in the middle east, and back away from the southern states, where most of the oil wells were."|0
I was surprised to like this movie since I 'm from the `` check your brain at the door and see if you live to be a hundred'' school of writing, and the writing in this movie makes no sense to me. The only reason this movie would be interesting to me is because of the title. I was expecting a better quality movie. I think the story was interesting but the writing sucked. This movie has the same kind of problem that most bad movies have when they're trying to say something new and engaging, especially in their first half.|0
Awful in a whole new way , ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs -- if only because that's what I am, the only movie buff in my family, and I have a great appreciation for the work done on these movies. I was just watching this on YouTube, and I'm pretty sure I saw the trailer at least 3 times. I have been going through this book since it first came out more than a year ago, so I have to admit that I was surprised when I saw this coming.|0
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great . Nothing is good Bloodline ...and it makes no sense to try to make a movie after seeing a movie like that. I have seen this movie 2x and the movie was very good but I think there are some problems after that. Bloodline is an awful movie, it has all the worst scenes ever and the story is unbelievable. I want to see another movie with that story, but this one is not good enough to make a good movies. And I think Hellraiser part 2 and 3 is pretty good.|0
I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.The Muppet movie is about how they all got started.|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy.|1
Ed Wood rides again . The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope . . . I have never understood why people think that if a movie is based on real life people its not good because its a fake . It has always been this way since the earliest days of cinema . I think that a movie is good if it tells a story and gives the characters and situations that you could identify with . I am also a movie fan and have always been interested in what real people would think about this movie .|0
This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc.|1
"One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in ""Wink Of An Eye"", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS."|1
With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.|1
"Altioklar: Master of the thieves. Watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched ""Identity (2003)"", ""Saw (2004)"", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said ""Eureka, eureka""(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It took only 10 minutes for me."|1
Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance.The film begins with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism.|1
One of my all-time favourite movies . Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time . If I had to be in that room with them at the time, it wouldn't be enough to have seen it before. I'm talking about the first time when your eyes first come to see this film . Then when the tears come, you have to let it all go, and you're glad you got to see it first. If you liked this, please give it a Like . Thank you so much .|0
You know, I really hate IMDb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. But here we go. Editing time!Holy moley is this bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow I've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is just abominal. It's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him.|1
"I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic."|1
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen . The visuals were so dang choppy it made me want to watch the movie twice to have it at the highest frame rate possible. Also I did not believe the premise of this movie even as I kept thinking that they would make it into an actual TV show, but I guess it’s just not gonna happen. I still have not seen a movie in a theater that I really dislike as much as this one. It is just so dang boring and slow that I was kind of in shock to the end.|0
"Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.Hearkening back to films like ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned"", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing."|1
This is a new Barbie movie . The graphics were really good . They made the movie seem partially realistic . The voice actors did a really good job . And the actresses did a good job . The first movie was a commercial success and the sequel will probably do even better . It has a lot of really good action . The movie's story was based on true events . And all the characters did a lot for the character . They did a great job in acting . I'm not a fan of the movie but I am very happy with some of the characters and I liked some of the dialog .|0
As a parent of two girls ( 14 and 11 ) I have grave doubts about this show and all of the books written about it. It's not about being strong or being brave. It's not about making the best of a bad situation and being an individual in the process. It's about getting the best out of what you can and what you have to deal with. And to be completely honest, it's not really that interesting. I have to tell you, after watching it once, I can't remember a thing about it.|0
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram. What a come down from Fox values and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox films. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan calmly walks across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter along, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown.|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old . Robert Sacchi nails every aspect of Bogart in this film. He gives you all the details that you would want him to give and gives you a film that is just as exciting as it is entertaining. As you know, there are many actors who play Bogart and the film is based on the life of Bogart. Sacchi plays Bogart and his life was the subject of this film and it works very well. You get all the information that you need to know about his life.|0
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not translate to any other movie that I have seen but is a great idea nonetheless. It's kind of confusing to me at the moment but I am not sure how to interpret it at the moment, maybe it's me not being as sharp as I should be with these films, but in my humble opinion it was great and very dark and moody. If you have some feedback on my interpretation feel free to comment below or on the film forum.|0
Let 's get things straight . I was raised Catholic , and in a very religious family , and spent more than 10 years in Catholic schools, and I did well . I was a good student from the very beginning. I did very well in Catholic High School, and I did well in Catholic colleges , and in several Catholic Universities . Then I came out . I got a job , and I got married and moved to USA , and there I became a Muslim . I had no problems in my job , but in the company I did have problems.|0
I agree with all aforementioned comments . This show was a delight to watch . Funny , witty , terrifically acted , with great chemistry. I think this movie will get a great amount of buzz for it's great acting . I hope you watch it. I am a big fan of your website. I can't agree with you on that. That's all I can say, this is a good show . The acting is very good. I like the chemistry in the story line. The movie is very entertaining , very funny , and the plot line is very good .|0
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration. After a session at a recording studio Frank Sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was Jewish. He lectured them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer.Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for Columbia records. If You Are But A Dream and the song written for the film, The House I Live In.|1
Amazing , amazing , amazing . What more can be said ? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the silver screen, it is a must see , must have on any theatre or concert tour , must buy your tickets in the theatre , and if there is a movie that you like , you should see it . I have seen it three times and it was the best of the three . It had it’s moments , it had its flaws , but it was a fun , entertaining movie , and the actors all had great chemistry and chemistry with one another .|0
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. Isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures?|1
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere.|1
"Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call ""humor"". That this movie, and Moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can out-isolationist Charles Lindbergh."|1
For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out.|1
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama, White Mama.In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story.|1
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/."|1
Overall , a well done movie . There were the parts that made me wince , and there were the parts that made me laugh . there were some things that weren't funny , but the humor was definitely there , and some of the action sequences were funny , i could just feel the humor , and i think that was the reason why most people who went to the theater were laughing . it's not a terrible movie , but it was not a great movie . but it's still better than almost anything that's come out recently .|0
This self-important , confusing b+w `` film '' watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip . You can tell the film itself is made to look like it's supposed to be seen by children at an art school , or at the very least by adults with children . And that's not all . You can see what it takes to produce this sort of film . The film has no story . It is simply a montage . The camera simply shows images from around the world . And you can tell that all these images are made from very simple images that can be obtained with a common camera .|0
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts . You must watch it for its strong characterisation and for the brilliant dialogue. I was so bored after seeing it that I could have stayed a day longer in the cinema. There are so many things that I want to write on this but the best part of this soaps life is that it is great in it’s first few scenes and the rest is a very enjoyable movie. To be honest the plot is not much to speak about . I will try and give some insight to it by the end of this post .|0
I like Arnold, and I love the subject matter, but this was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I admit, most of his are pretty good!). He had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited.|1
Whoa , this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen ! The packaging for the film is absolutely terrible. The first time I watched it was in theatres, which was the very first time that the film had been shown in a theatre, and it is not a very good film. The first movie that I saw in theatres (at my local theatre) was the first film I ever watched (when I was a teenager) and I could not see why I did not like it. I was expecting to enjoy the film as much as I enjoy a good horror movie.|0
"`` The Racketeer '' stars Carol ( deprived of the `` e '' that usually appeared at the end of the title ) as a Racketeer . .. versionadded:: 5.5
   This is the 5.5 release. .. index: Racket(2)

=============
Racket(2) is the successor of Racket(1). =============
Racket(2.0) was released in February 2001. It is the last version of Racket(2). There are a lot of changes to the language, and now it is more easy to write Racket
compilers, but at the same time you can also use it for more complicated programs."|0
This is definitely a touching movie , and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle . The movie is full of symbolism , symbolism is everywhere , even in the soundtrack ! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! I saw it with my son and I was struck by how much of his pain and anger were mirrored by our own reactions to the situation that had been set into motion. His anger was directed at the government, his rage at the injustice he had witnessed and felt so powerless in . His frustration and frustration was reflected in our anger as well .|0
When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake , I was breathless . I do n't know how many times I've gone to the bathroom after seeing that scene and not wanting to wait for the credits, but it never seemed like such a bad idea when it came to me. I had never seen the original movie and still had a lot of questions as to whether the film was the best version of King Kong I'd seen. I also didn't think I'd ever want to see the first film again after it turned out that the original film was a bit of a disaster.|0
"In fact it was awful. The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. It was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. Sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? No they aren't. At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a ""creative writing"" course. Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure."|1
OK, this movie, was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion.|1
I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great, very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep, he wrote it in 2:45.|1
at the story . It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of not being good enough and feeling like she is being scammed out of her future . When her family takes a vacation in the United States of America, they are introduced to a girl that will make their dreams come true ! It takes place in the city of San Francisco where they find the girl and her family but soon learn that they will not make it to the promised land and find that she is more than they can imagine .|0
I 'm not sure if this is a comedy or not , but I found it pretty comical . Isobel is the most popular girl in secondary school to me, and she knows it. I also think she is the smartest girl of her generation and she would always have a question about something. She doesn’t seem to like the popular girl because she is more intelligent. So I guess I have been spoiled with girls that are more popular than I, but I can see she is pretty cool in a different way. She is a good dancer, good listener, a good friend.|0
I love this movie , first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end of this film was so sad and so heartbreaking to me, I hope that this doesn’t ruin anything else in the film . I hope you like it as well, I thought I would share my review of this one. A story that I never wanted to see was a film that I never wanted to watch , and I’m so glad that I had the opportunity to see it , and if you haven’t seen it I highly recommend you go see it.|0
Awesome Movie ! Great combination of talents ! I 'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding . He had a fantastic time and did a wonderful job . I would rate this as a 5 - Star ! It has all of the elements you would expect from a David Duchovny performance and it comes together seamlessly . It is one of the very best movies ever made . I have already seen this film twice on the big screen , so it will definitely be a treat for me and I can only imagine how much you all will enjoy this movie .|0
"George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great . I 've heard some horror stories but I've never had the kind of terror that I had for the last time with this film. I found this film to be the most exciting and exciting and scary film I 've ever seen at the movies . I would recommend to anyone that has the chance . It is a scary film and one that I would definitely recommend to you and I know I 'm not the only one who will be saying that after watching this film

A great film, well directed and written."|0
I did have some expectations from this film because 1 . It was a Yash raj production 2 . When the first teaser was released, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice change from a lot of other Bollywood films that have been in development and production for a long time. 3 . It was a very fun movie and a very well shot one. 4 . I got to know a lot more about the movie's characters, story, the director and the producer. I was really entertained by the way the film was made.|0
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary ""Don't Look Now"" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema."|1
The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist.|1
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia , as long as a person knows the local dialect they can speak the language of their choice . It was not the case in England or in the USA. This may seem strange, but when you visit your native country it's a common experience to have a conversation in a language other than the one you were born in , and you can understand it, or at least you can understand it to the point of being understood if you're lucky.|0
Oh , the horror , the unspeakable horror of this film . If you can even call it a film . For some reason it makes me want to sit in the car on the street corner watching this thing play out in the dark . But , it's true . It's really a scary movie. And yes , I recommend you sit in a car if that's all you have , and you can see this movie in the dark. But , you do have the option of sitting in the dark to see this movie , and it is one of the scariest horror films ever made.|0
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight . I must say , I was amazed to see all the great performances and great actors. I am so glad that this movie has been selected for this year’s Best Picture Oscar . For me , I feel that the film is so much more than a romantic comedy . The film also deals with the issues of terrorism , religion , family, and the loss of innocence . I’ve always liked this movie as I found it very interesting .|0
This movie is very modern and forward . It is about 75 % in English . It is aimed at the young audiences. The plot is simple , there is only one main character , a teenager , who falls into a dangerous situation in a remote place and she has to save her family and her friends . The girl has a strong belief that she can make a new life and she is very brave . Kamal, a young man from the city of Jaipur , lives in his uncle's house . He loves to ride motorcycles .|0
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie movies being made. While that is certainly the case with many other countries, it's worth noting that Australia has a much higher rate of movie production than the USA (and even New Zealand), and there's no denying that there are far more good movies out there. Australia's film production has been steadily growing in the last few decades, as shown by the fact that in 2014, the year of our last census, it was estimated to have about 5 per cent of world production of films.|0
This movie has an outstanding acting, by Marilia Pêra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. The children weren't actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it does happen till today.|1
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it 's a load of hogwash ( the CPUSA was a sham) but that it presents the real story as it is. The CPUSA has been trying and failing to present the real story for decades and the reason for the failures is clear and obvious. The real story and the one presented by the CPUSA is that of the Communist Party being controlled by a group of individuals, a faction or clique. What is most troubling is that the story is told and presented as a tale of power, lies, corruption, greed and betrayal.|0
"In ""Red Letters"", Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with ""Red Letters""...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time."|1
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as a box office blockbuster and for making so many Tamil movies. I am a big fan of this movie too, but I feel it should have not been made as box office blockbuster.The story of the movie was not very interesting and I feel it didn’t give much of an edge to the movie. The film was released on 29 March 2016 and got a decent response from the movie goer. But still this film was not a box office hit.|0
During filming, was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon? It was like she was reading from an autocue. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. I read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface.|1
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement.|1
Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V . movie based on the Peter Kurth novel of the same name and the film was released on 13 and 14 August 2014 in Canada and the United States. The two-part film featured two of the best known Russian film directors of the day, Alexey Popogokin and Oleg Vengerov, as well as the young Russian actress Anna Koval, who was the lead actress in the movie. The story follows Anna's search for her missing father who disappeared at the age of one and whose remains were found six years later in an isolated location.|0
"One of the worst films I have ever seen ! After watching it i walk out like , what happened to all those beautiful women who were in it ?! I mean i like the story so much, but there is just so much of it in this movie that one can just about see why it was made ! There is some really funny lines in it and some serious moments, but that is all in the film and it has nothing to do with the movie itself

I know I have said this before. It is one of those films that everyone has seen."|0
This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old `` cons turn good '' yarn , which we have seen all too many times over the last two weeks. And it may work, but only if we can manage to get a few more people in the room, and get on their nerves a little more. One of the most important problems in our current environment is the lack of communication. There are people in positions of authority and power who know and care nothing about the lives of their people. They care about themselves, not the people they are supposed to serve.|0
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about , however a copy that I had never seen at the local library. I have however since been to the local library where this DVD was located and have been reading reviews of this film. Although this is not a documentary style film it does manage to tell its story fairly well even though the narration is somewhat forced. The film also does a fairly good job of telling us what the movie is all about without going overboard on the subject matter.|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year 's Cannibal Ferox . The characters are universally awful. It's a shame too, because it's funny. And it's so bad, it makes me hope that it might actually be funny at some point. The thing is, I don't want to enjoy it. I don't even want to watch it in a theater because I'd rather read it. It's so bad, I could watch it in a movie theater at home and not be able to laugh while I watch it.|0
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old.|1

This was a very special film. It has so much depth and is full of life and drama. This is a good movie to watch for the lovers of action, thriller and Bollywood movies.I am not going to talk about the technical aspects here, I would rather go into the actual film itself, which is the best movie that you will never forget, and the one that is worth your time."|0
I still count `` Police Squad ! '' as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s . Somewhere , I know it, I'm laughing . Not at the show , I'm laughing . Of course, some of that was because the character of Inspector Morse wasn't based on anything other than a real person . He was an amalgamation of three different people , and it was only a matter of time before they went on to create their own TV series . For me, though , the character really came alive with the first season .|0
So keira knightly is in it ... So automatically we compare this film to attonement . Aside rom the fact it is so much like attion it is basically impossible to not be impressed by it . Not only is keira's character just as strong , but the chemistry is flawless . This film does a fantastic job of making you care about a young man , and his family. I agree with the previous posters on this one, I really enjoyed this film, though i have never seen it before, and was glad when i could go to it on DVD.|0
Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.|1
"i was one ""chosen"" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game ""far cry"", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's ""the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail""."|1
This is a decent movie . Although little bit short in time for me , it packs a lot of punch . The plot begins when a young man from a small town goes to live in a big city and he falls in love with a girl from a different class of people. It's a classic romantic-thriller , and it gets better and better as it progresses . The plot is quite straightforward , so it doesn't distract from the storyline . The script is quite good , if a bit stiff , and the cinematography is pretty good as well . One thing is a bit lacking .|0
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone . Even as he aged Wellman seemed to be more and more convinced of his own genius. Wellman, one of the finest directors ever to have worked on film , was born in Boston on February 3, 1884, the second son of a tailor. Wellman was the second of seven children, three of his brothers and sisters having preceded him. His mother was a French-Canadian lady, and his father’s family spoke French. He lived with his grandfather and uncle, both of whom were also well-known New England fabriciers.|0
This is a beautiful , yet simple movie about one man , driven to find an answer , an answer for his own question , which is why ? The question is - is the question the answer ? And that is why , it all starts with the little boy in the car . He had the answer , and he had it in the palm of his hand . Then suddenly he was alone in the room . He was all alone . All his friends were dead . All his dreams . All of his life , his memories . All his hopes for the future , all for himself .|0
"This Blake Edwards film is n't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy , a drama or a drama. If it had to describe itself in three word descriptors it would be: ""WTF? I didn't even know this movie was in production or anything!"" And the reason why it isn't is because I haven't seen the film yet, so my review is written in a very light and vague manner. But I will say that the film's story is interesting and if you are interested in knowing more about the movie and why it is good, I suggest watching this film."|0
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. Recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced Merchant Ivory-type features. I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain.'|1
`` Yagyu ichizoku no inbo '' ( let 's just say `` The Shogun 's Samurai '' ) is somewhere in the middle, or at least somewhere near middle-ish. It's quite a good film, and the story is well done, but the music is a little thin. It's an unfortunate choice of music for a samurai story, as I think the soundtrack is one reason why it isn't so well-received. In short, the music is really good, and the sound-design is top-notch. The animation, by the way, is pretty much on par with a normal animated movie, which is great.|0
I 'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer , ex-rugby player , and ex-boxer , and I love this movie.It is based on a true story , and it's about a young british boy who was born into a violent gang , and he grew up with no father or mother to give him love and affection .I don't really want to talk about the details , but the film is about the boy , and it is about how he grew up .I like the film , although I don't know how I could get more out of it.|0
"This is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, did in fact have more laughs. This, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet ""Yahoo Serious"" so I could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. There is also very few things to say about Australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit."|1
Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my man I would never disrespect. Those Mobsters were spooky. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt u if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why?|1
"One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, ""Ten Cents a Dance"" stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dance-hall girl ""Barbara"" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite ""plain-jane"" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who's very different from the dashing Carlton."|1
being a fan of Bela Lugosi , Boris Karloff , and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe. I saw this on a TV show last year and i was so sick when i walked in and saw this. I can't say it is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen but the acting, the production, the atmosphere of this one is some of the best that you'll see in a movie. I'm glad i saw this. If you've seen it just go to your favorite video store and rent this.|0
"I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. It's not that I don't ""get it"" -- I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought ""Don't tell them, show them,"" then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.First of all, The Terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this."|1
"I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. I remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family.Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like ""this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid..."|1
This is one of the funniest movies I 've ever saw . A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an article explaining his reasons for going into business to be a successful comedian. It's hysterical! I love it!! I thought you might enjoy the video! You may want to watch the trailer before reading further! I know I did. But I just thought you'd like to see. I know a lot of people who watch the video and want to read about the reasons Jason went into comedy. I wanted to make sure to include as much information as possible.|0
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3), this is fast-paced, in your face, rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken.The story lines are spurious, at best, but it's deliberate, as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters.|1
"I 'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie . ( I 'm not counting super bug budget , no budget for that )

If I had to pick the single best superhero film ever it would be Iron Man . While the rest were decent films , Iron Man had some brilliant ideas and came out ahead of the pack . I 'm looking at you , Batman . You 're the king of the world and have a ton of money , but all your films suck . Now you 've got a new toy . You 'll get a sequel , and the world will see you 've got a second chance ."|0
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish.|1

OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality?|1
I awarded this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which has been butchered beyond recognition in places. What can possibly be said? They took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides -- and insights -- ripped out). I do very much blame the director, who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script.|1
"`` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL . A computer programmer is investigating an accident where HAL is involved. His research suggests that this was the first computer virus ever created, but he does not know whether the virus itself was responsible for the accident that killed his mother. As he continues his investigation, HAL's personality becomes increasingly odd and violent, leading the researcher to fear that HAL is a dangerous madman who will harm humanity and destroy the Earth. In the original script, the character was known as "" HAL 9000 ."""|0
"If you 're in the middle of a ferocious war and it 's still not clear that you 're going to win, I can understand that. Even though it might not make sense to you at first. And even though you might not be sure what to do. But I can understand that. At least I think I can, because I have spent time in battle, and I know the feeling. ""So I can tell you what my experience has been in war, because I've been in it. And I know what to do to help the people."|0
Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs.|1
"this is the worst movie in the world . the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the plot was so confusing. I don't care if you give it one, i give it 3

I gave it a 2-3 because it is so bad. I hate how they changed the storyline and now it is really boring. They made this movie feel so bad and they should not bother with making it any better. I don't understand how they made it so boring, they were even trying to make this movie seem like a good movie. This movie is absolutely trash."|0
I have just caught this Movie on TCM, and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this was the best MGM could serve up to him. It is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. It featured two of my favouriteplayers in Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell(the best actor in the Film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady Frances Gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical.|1
This is a poor , poor movie . Full of clichés , unrealistic moments : punching the air in celebration after being saved by an alien , the scene after the credits where he tries to take his clothes off , or the scene after he finally sees his wife and his children for the very first time . I don’t even need to say more. That said , the story is good . After all , it is a classic sci-fi adventure . But it fails to deliver on what it promises . Plot : A team of astronauts on an asteroid mining mission has been rescued by an alien.|0
I've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. I later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously.|1
In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her.|1
this film sucks a big one . so many holes in the plot . if the devil is invincible , then why the devil's minions would not fight back if they could? they would. it is a bit sad to watch this movie , it has some great action , a bit of gore and lots of blood . i know what you are trying to say . but it all makes me want to see it more . i know you will not let me do this but you need to try it . it is an enjoyable movie . you will love it .|0
Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen , clearly inspired by Rock Hudson 's performance. As he has done in the past, Day has produced an all-star cast for his play, with stars including Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Northam, Jessica Brown Findlay, and Jason Bateman playing the parts of the lead male characters. The play's opening is scheduled to be held on November 23, but that is not the end of Day's plans for the production. After a press screening, he is set for a reading on November 30 and a Q&A afterwards.|0
Larry Bishop, the Writer/Actor/Director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The film is a bomb.The Victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists.|1
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.I have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. Instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'The Deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery.|1
Dr. Marnie Bannister ( Magda Konopka ) is a horribly disfigured woman . When one of her colleagues discovers a photograph of her daughter, she realizes that it could be the key to her daughter’s long-term mental health. When her daughter is brought into the clinic for evaluation, it becomes apparent that not only will the young woman be severely mentally retarded but she will also likely end up being locked in her room for life . With the help of the team that has been assembled for her, the doctor is able to save her life .|0
Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction.|1
"Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to watch on VHS. The film was an animated short that had a very colorful feel to it. The story was very interesting and had some really cool animation to it. This was one of a kind. I will be reviewing this film with a special emphasis on animation. I will give you a detailed review of how it turned out, so you can see if it's worth your time to see it or not. Synopsis:

The story is quite simple and simple."|0
"If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared , Death in Venice would have to be that movie! To make up for this lack of good films of the 60's and 70's , a whole host of lesser movies were produced during this period which are now lost. A few examples:

1. Death at Sea , a movie made between 1957-1960 and released in 1960, only one copy of which survived. It's a great look at life on the high seas during the age of sail. It had a cult following before it was made."|0
well , i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now on DVD. but it still holds up quite well and has several great moments. In the early 90's, i had a friend who spent his entire weekend at a friends house, and this is when he showed me this. i've still yet to meet my friend that had a VHS copy of this, so i hope this is the case. i remember watching this with my parents as a kid and my brother as well.|0
"The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled ""Our Family Trouble."" To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line."|1
"If you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (I guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! The plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the ""actors"" can sleep at night! It's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and I highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something."|1
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure.|1
Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country , which is always the Northern part . If black people were shown this kind of violence , we’d kill them and kill them all. And we need to make sure the blacks know this is coming and that they are part of this. And we need to start a movement and stop this kind of stuff . As you know, the violence in Charlottesville is about white supremacy, about racism, about violence towards white people. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot of violence in the United States against African Americans.|0
I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. I was a 13 year old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) and then his knighting by the Queen. It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK.|1
"At the beginning of the movie, Ramgopal Verma says that ""Sarkar"" is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic. Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. Amitabh Bachchan plays ""Sarkar"", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home."|1
"Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to encountering the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile the Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause trouble in the town, Brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.The original Critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick ""Gremlins"". It became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel."|1
"This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be ""A Sandra Bullock Movie"". She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere..."|1
We 've all seen bad movies , well this one takes the cake . I 've seen that Junior movie in a couple of my classes so when I saw this , I knew it was a good movie and I had to bring it back for sure . The music and action scenes are amazing . After watching this I knew I had to watch it again. This movie is really scary but at the same time funny. This is a very scary and suspenseful movie about a girl who becomes a vampire and has to stay a virgin for a year and a half.|0
Got the chance to see this at a friend 's house today , and was impressed with what it achieved ! I am the type of person who is always amazed by technology and the things we can do now with technology, I am not sure if you know what I mean, but this is what I have been talking to my friend about , she is going to get her hands on it this evening , I am sure she will be awestruck ! It looks like someone from Microsoft, but i have never seen anything like this.|0
"This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the head-banging music this movie revolved around. Chris/Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME!! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery. The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride."|1
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family.|1
Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it's must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, Jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme out was a very good choice.|1
I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old . Only `` The Treasure of the Sierra Madre '' was not only so old it could not have been any longer produced, but was also so old it was more or less the first of many Hollywood horror films. It was produced by John Farrow (who, as I've written before, has been involved in a great deal of horror production since the early '90s), his son Christopher Farrow, and the screenwriting team of the two of them.|0
The threesome of Bill Boyd , Robert Armstrong , and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand-off. This is the beginning of what is to me a rather strange episode. But, if we are to get into that, let’s just take it one step further. Let’s get into what I am sure is happening. Coney Island is in a position of great need. Its attractions are all over the map. In some places there’s nothing. In others there is an entire amusement park or amusement park complex built around an attraction.|0
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody like Scary Movie.|1
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.From the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events I've ever seen in a film. It would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life.|1
Yesterday I watched this tv production , and I was very disappointed.I did n't have big expectations when it was shown, but after watching this show, I was disappointed. It seems to me like it's all in favor of the government . All the criminals who are caught will be executed . No doubt it will be a war , but for how many years? It's like a horror movie , and I'm glad to see it. It's sad because I like the show . I like it, it was very good .|0
(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.|1
"""Hood Rat"" is absolutely terrible. This is a urban version of ""Willard"". I just can't believe this movie got made, let alone distributed. Someone in Universal Studios thought that people would watch and like this ""movie"". The only good thing in this is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. The one thing I hate in movies is sped up action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Every scene transition is some fast motion special effect. The director should be banned from making movies forever."|1
A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The sounds,courtesy of Japanese band 'Dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. It's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. All in all, they worked everything out perfectly....Well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted.|1
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films . I found the film at first boring, then I watched it again , and it blew my mind. I thought it was really good, and so did it's fans. It was amazing. And I think I may have even watched the entire movie at least once. The only problem with this movie is that you have to sit there and wait for the credits, but that doesn't seem like too much of an inconvenience . I love the way it is set up.|0
"I wo n't waste your time by describing the plot for this , the other reviewer already did this quite thoroughly , I will simply point you to it and you can read it for yourselves , or better yet go on youtube and watch their version of it or something. First I want to point out that they are both wrong. 1) You can't be both a good and a bad father. 2) A father is NOT a parent,

3) A mother is not a wife. 4) The word ""husband"" does not automatically make you the husband."|0
"I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course as I'm sure you know that ""Malcolm's in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes ""The Amanda Show"" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure that we can all re-late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywood.SPOILERS AHEADAs it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems."|1
Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. It features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though.|1
"(Contains really bad Spoilers) So what can I say about this....It's a really HORRIBLE and AWFUL movie! !.Too much CGI and special effects....you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is! !.PLEASE at least go watch ""Dungeons and Dragons"" which is another terrible pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons way better!!! Uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap!!!!!!!!!!! !I Hate this Trash!!"|1
`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.'|1
This can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. But I have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to be remembered.To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted.|1
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from Getty Images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?)|1
"At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette , trying to free his no good brother. John and Nathan were the only two boys in the whole town of Red Rock Canyon. And John wanted to get them out of town before he was arrested. But then something unexpected happened:
The three boys and their older sister went to see their father, John Russell , who they thought they knew. And that was all it took. With the help of their father and John's brothers , the Russell boys
and their older sister were out of town and safe."|0
"It´s all my fault. They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the old TV-series. They were right. While production values are good and the actors themselves (including ""don´t look now"") Julie Christie aren´t that bad, the whole film displays a cheekiness and self-conciousness that clearly is without any justification. A comparison between the Karloff ""Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns 2000"" comes to my mind. In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series."|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time, I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. This is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.This show sucks.Its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous.|1
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly ! ! I related to the character Ann August more than most of my younger friends but I also understood why she was such a strong character, I had to learn a lot to make the best out of the movie. I am not a movie buff at all (although I watched a lot of horror movies as a child and loved them very much) but I thought I would make a post about it. I have always been a big fan of horror flicks. In fact I have seen a lot of the horror movies on TV or in theatres.|0
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in GodHe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulations. Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. Just think about it.|1
If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity.|1
"As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books ( of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the only example ) this series was well worth a look

There are also several series by the same author which are worth a look. In my opinion the best of them all is the series of ‘Namakami’ books by Mariko Hayami ( who also published the series ‘Fate’ by the same author ) The series was created in the ’90’s and the first book was published in the ’80’’s by Shueisha."|0
First of all , before I start my review , I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie ' so far. It's been a while since I was a huge 'Muppets fan ,but I still love all of the Muppets on stage and screen. I don't know if anyone else has seen or seen 'Muppets From Space ', but I was a big fan when it came out. The movie came out in 1987 and was written, directed and starred by Jim Henson. Now, I don't know what I expected from the Muppets , but I was really hoping the movie would be great.|0
This is marvelous movie, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes talk. Especially on the silent scenes. The window of Ale is a great one. An the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I have seen. Apart from directing. It has been a quite time I did not watch a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul.|1
"Deep Water (2006) ****""It is indifferent... it's there waiting for you to make one slip up."" Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean I have ever heard muttered. Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. Those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the World. If you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now."|1
... with a 500 $ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no subtitles, you will enjoy this movie. I hope my review is not biased, it was just an honest review. If you like C movies with good cinematography, this is the right movie for you! Overall this is my first review in this forum, I’ll just give you the review without any bias. *This movie was well made but I would say it lacked a certain touch of realism in certain scenes that would add to the movie rather than add realism.|0
I am a firm believer that a film, TV serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-80's on TV and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the full series DVD set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film . It is full of great action scenes , which are executed well by the actors , but it lacks any emotional investment in the characters and its story. This is because it lacks any real heart of the story. There is no love or emotion in this film. This is a bad movie . It is filled with action and drama . But its story and characters are not interesting . There are some decent scenes in the movie but they lack any real human feeling or emotion in them .|0
it 's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams. I am not saying you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves. Just that it’s a little sad that the tech that made it possible for so many people is also giving us something that we can’t use anymore and that’s the privacy that we lost. And, I’m sorry if you are not feeling that bad, but I hope that you realize that you are not the only ones. I hope to see you this year.|0
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV . It was both entertaining and informative . The reason the show has been such a success in this regard is that not only was the show very funny and intelligent , the show was also very informative . I have seen a few other shows that have done this and have not had as much success. The show was well done and very entertaining as well. I liked it too! It had a great mix of both sides of history. There was lots of humor, history, and drama.|0
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really could n't understand those who did n't like it . But I think there are some things which need to be revised and added . Also if anyone wants to see more pictures of the costumes , I have uploaded the photo below . In fact I am posting the same one here for the people to view . Thank you so much . Please don't forget to like , subscribe and comment so that we can be updated . It was fun to see the costumes together . And also I have attached the first and the third season's poster .|0
This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and I want to die' garbage. But the movies from the 80's are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!|1
I'm a Christian, and I have watched pretty of Christian movies, but this one is too bad. They try to make this good, but it's too hard for them I think.- You can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. I think there will be a lot more of them.- The quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. The story is not so very bad, but could've been better.|1
This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films , most often in the form of an alien invasion. But it really lacks any of the genuine suspense found in the most successful science fiction films of the past decade. The movie has an interesting premise, but I was disappointed that it lacked any tension or suspense. The action in this movie is rather simplistic and slow. One thing I definitely noticed as I began to watch this movie was how the aliens really seem to be an alien force - they are not some kind of alien army.|0
I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through.|1
As an ancient movie fan , I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of my most memorable movies. It is not that I didn't like the movie or the film. It's just not my style of movies. I would like to say I did not like it, I was in the middle of the movie, I had already seen it a couple of times and I didn't really pay any attention. I'm sure I would like it much more than the average person who doesn't like movies for that reason.|0
Despite the all-star cast , this attempt at epic fails . It comes across as a set of flat cartoon characters. It's as if the filmmakers wanted us to be entertained by what the characters are doing. But we don't care. We don't have time to be entertained. These characters, like so many other movies, are just plain bad . You know what? It's okay. Because I am an adult. And a grown-ass man. I am not interested in watching cartoons like this. In fact, I don't care for any cartoons.|0
"Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist."|1
"Don't get me wrong. I've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to ""Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys"" sticks a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun, ""Head Of The Family"" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W."|1
If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you 're hoping for another `` Vidocq '' ... wait you 're not alone, there are many of these, and all they are doing is making the movie seem like one big movie, with too many characters, too many ideas, way too long, it seems as if they've made a movie out of every film they saw in a theater last week, except The Mummy and The Mummy 3, that is, which are movies I 've already finished, and I don't care, I 'm finished.|0
Most awful casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack head, a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on.............Stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the streets. It's a joke!The only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that I finished watching it. I just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end.Trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie. Trying to be freaky. So stupid!|1
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison.|1
Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect , specifically some of the acting . However I feel that I did a great job at making a story that has all the elements that make up a good story in any form of media, but it is still my story, and I would encourage anyone to watch it . In the end I think that this is a story that anyone can enjoy and be entertained by, if they want to read it . If you are in the area, you can watch the show on the IFC network which is the official streaming site .|0
This noisy , dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well , at least everyone but Michael Shannon. After seeing the documentary on BBC One, one of the many reasons to catch up on the last year, it's easy to see why people are talking about it. And while I didn't find it as entertaining as I did expected, it's an entertaining film that will be on many people's nightstands come November. But I think I have a slightly different take on it than you might expect.|0
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review . Bone Eater hits its mark for being the most fun book in this series. The only thing missing from the first book was more character development, and so while we got a pretty solid plot and the characters, I felt the lack of depth of the characters. That is not a flaw of the series, it's just an issue. The story has a lot of mystery, but that is not its point. The plot of the story is very interesting.|0
"Wealthy businessman's daughter, who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath, discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by daddy (whom she affectionately refers to as ""Darling""); worse than that, she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live, leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's screenplay (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot, which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk."|1
There's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts.|1
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First off a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. Finally, It introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.A new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving.|1
Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. I can't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here folks. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous.|1
"The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. She telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an ""actress"" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as Dad is 'trying to impress his boss'."|1
Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.Every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless.|1
"No music . No stupid masala . A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on actual police encounters

“There are two things that you have to remember, you have got to play the game correctly and if you are playing it wrong you can’t win, you have to be aware of that because if you’re wrong you are making your enemy’s game a lot more difficult for him, and if you play it rightly he has a lot more room for you to grow.”

The first is the fact that no system is 100% flawless."|0
It's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest I've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to America's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..Please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this?|1
I ca n't believe I sat through this garbage . Palm trees in D.C. ( already mentioned ) , a city that I love and love so much , I think it deserves to go bankrupt. It's hard to believe this is the same city where I had the chance to go on an amazing trip a year ago . I had the opportunity to eat at some of the best restaurants there, go on tours , go on the water safaris. It's hard to believe, it's so easy to forget that this place has been destroyed . I'm sick of these stories.|0
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings.|1
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want.|1
"I thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of ""national security."" The show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. After a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and I started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead."|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . Taylan biraderler ( taylan biraderler ) is one of many movies of this type. It is considered the most authentic Turkish horror film. Synopsis (in Turkish) : Taylan Biraderler is a story that has been created in an unusual way. It's about an ordinary high school student, Taylan Biraderler, who is going through life. Taylan is a quiet and reserved boy. But he's not so simple. He is the leader and the best student of his school and the most diligent of teachers.|0
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt , although that some found it slow or incomplete . I like that the information is there, not just on the page but on the phone line itself . It was very much worth it , although not the cheapest thing available . It is still not possible for us to offer this service over our internet and phone lines , although we are working on it . At present , we do not have any plans to introduce the service any further . If there is demand then we will continue to add to this service , perhaps by introducing more categories to it .|0
""" While sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. With material like this, timing is everything (Michael Moore knew to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. In 2006, mockery of the well-settled Bush Administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."|1
I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies ever made. Now I don't know much about horror and I haven't seen the movie, so I can't really say how much of this is real or how much it is just bad acting and editing. I don't want to give any spoilers for that and I'll try to cover most of this in one post. So if you do go see the movie or don't want to spoil anything then just read on and I will give you some thoughts on the movie.|0
This movie clearly has an agenda , which could be summed up like this : Never , never cross the border. You never know what kind of monsters are lurking behind the border fences. Why don´t they leave it to the experts and let them figure it out? And why would they want to use the US as an example ? Especially when there are plenty of countries with a better history and tradition of cooperation ? That´s not the first time I heard that, and it won´t be the last. I have to say I am shocked by the way that some of our politicians act like idiots.|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
The Calu-what now ? Yeah , I thought it was a stupid name as well . Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware that he is being used for some purpose. A lot of people seem to have a problem with his use in this thread, but I can’t blame him, he’s just being a big baby. Here’s what I found out. 1. This is just the way he thinks. 2. This thread has been mentioned on other forums. 3. In a sense, I think that Carter would like for this thread to be about him.|0
When naïve young Eddie Hatch , a window dresser at Savory 's Department Store , falls for a statue of Greek goddess Aphrodite . When she rejects his advances, Eddie leaves the shop and he never sees the statue again. He decides to take revenge on the goddess by stealing all the money that Aphrodite has in her possession. In order to find out what was in her coffers and what he is going to get, Eddie sets out on his own to find her and discover just how far he would have to go to find her.|0
"Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion . The story has three parts, the last of which takes place before the war. It is a ""short"" movie (less than three hours in duration) but it contains quite a bit of animation. In fact it contains over sixty minutes of animation and many of the characters speak animated dialogue. The story is told by three characters: Mr. Sato, the Japanese governor of Manila; Mr. Kawada, the Japanese military attaché; and Mr. Takayama, the Japanese consul."|0
"I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. Only ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" holds up this well, performance-wise. As someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. Otto Preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style."|1
Now, I love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. Surely no one actually WROTE dialogue this pointless.|1
"My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of ""bad"" movies. Among the flicks we watched, the strongest contender (for quality bad-movie fare) was easily Jack-O. It's ludicrous that movies such as ""Gigli"", ""Glitter"" and ""You Got Served"" are listed in IMDBs bottom 100. While they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. They're robbing ""Jack-O"", and ""Keeper of Time"", etc, of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve.So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)?"|1
"I'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first ""Road"" picture I've seen. I was expecting waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of the Road movies. If that's true I needn't bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.I didn't like the movie."|1
"What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's ""madness"" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction."|1
"First of all , the entire script is mostly improv , adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are seeing here is real . There was no time for it to be written out with all of the other elements , the whole idea being to create the illusion , and if you believe in the script , the illusion must have been good. (I don’t want to spoil anything for those who aren’t going to have it)

The part I’m more interested in is the music. What do you guys think the music is, what is its purpose and who composed it."|0
"Mark Walhberg in a great role , idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs , but does not like him. This role was also used for the film ‘Fitzcarraldo’ . I did not like this movie because it was a very boring film but I enjoyed playing this character. Sebastian

A film based on a biography written by a British film maker, the film is set in London during the 1960s. This movie has nothing to do with real events and is a fictional film that is inspired by real life."|0
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture I can only think this is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. This movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.|1
What can I say about a movie as bad as this ? The people who made this movie , did not read a word of my review, I'm sorry , but I'm not here to judge it. This movie was not a good idea. It was a great idea. I've seen worse. I didn't write a review just because it was bad. I write reviews because a lot of them are good. I don't want to give people a bad review. I don't even care if you write one.|0
"A fairly interesting look at some characters from India 's burgeoning middle class . Although India is rapidly modernizing , it still faces a series of issues that are not well-acknowledged by the mainstream media. I think it's more than possible that they'll be a part of the mainstream media's consciousness by the time they write about them. Sunday, September 16, 2010

There's an interesting story in the New York Times that's trying to shed light on India's rapidly modernizing society. The story is called, ""Where Do Indians Live When they Can't Go Home""?"|0
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill."|1
"I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival . The Beagle 's only in a couple of cities I think but if anyone has a copy here is a link and it will put you on the site http://www.cinemasandfestivals.co.uk/film_tickets.htm

Last edited by JF on 27th Feb 2009, 09:50, edited 1 time in total. I would recommend that if you see this film to watch it at some time in the afternoon/evening. I find that when I see it at night, I feel as if there is just so much more to see, it is too crowded and I get bored."|0
"Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and "" Big "" John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film."|1
Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still, even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense.Water has become incredibly rare substance?Well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voilà, water.Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after.|1
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron! ), the piano-playing dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back, funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc.|1
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? In this episode, we watch footage of the worst thing that can possibly happen to a child, and then watch the footage repeatedly to show how bad it really is. We'll watch this video, watch it again, and then see if there's anything we can do to stop this horror from happening. It really is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen, but there's a solution to make it more bearable.|0
Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name `` employee of the month '' might ring bells with a certain type of worker, but it makes no sense unless we have some sort of incentive for the person in question to join the company. If there is only an initial incentive for a new employee, it may well be too low. A few years ago, I took a job in an industry where people who had the name of the company they worked at were entitled to stock or shares in their company.|0
Based on what little i have seen of this show I do n't think I will ever watch it again. I will however be checking out the rest of Season 3 (which I've also seen at some point). But, I have a bit of a history with this show. I have watched Season 1 twice. It was good, but not my cup of tea. At that point of it all, it was a show I didn't understand and a show I was interested in but was never really a fan of.|0
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself . The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a pool or sea. A lot of leg shows in this movie look like this. You know what I mean. This is the movie that is so far the one that I don't like in the theaters. So I was glad when I saw it in DVD. And it is. But not the way I wanted it . It was bad. Not like the way I want a good movie to look, but bad.|0
Can you people please stop believing everything this man says . Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. I am not a fan of what he is doing but I don't believe that he has the brains to think of something so blatantly wrong as to be a conspiracy theorist. The only reason these people are calling for his execution is because they dont believe in God and that they dont see Jesus as the Messiah. Which is the most ridiculous thing in the world. He is not a Christian, because the way he's being persecuted makes him a Christian.|0
I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and I watched a video on it, so I was really into watching it. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like, I have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool.|1
in his descriptions of CAA , platinum card lunches in Hollywood , psychoanalysis , a vacation in Provincetown he never mentions , and the list goes on . It's a bit long , but there are a few key moments I can remember from the story. In a scene from the story , he is walking along the beach when his cell phone rings , and it's a friend. He takes the phone , looks at the phone , then looks at his watch , looks back at the phone, looks down to the phone , looks up to the phone and then looks at his watch .|0
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity.|1
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that).|1
After some quite OK Dutch action flicks , like Lek and Van God Los , Gerrard Verhage wants to make a comeback in this season’s World Cup. After winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup with his Ajax side, Gerrard was the best man for the Netherlands in the 2011 Confederations Cup. Now he wants to win back the World Cup. I am not saying this is the right way to win, but it is not a bad way. The last time I was at the Olympics, I wanted to win. But I was worried that the Germans would win.|0
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers.|1
"Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it! )I do wonder, however, how a certain... um, finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though--especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question!"|1
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting . Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a theater troupe who takes a chance on one of his actors who he believes to be a genius. However the guy in question is really a buffoon and ends up getting his nose torn off by an elephant. As for the other actors Humphrey Bogie seems to spend most of the film sitting on the stage with the elephants. I’ve never seen a picture with that much makeup and it’s quite disturbing.|0
I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.I am grading this not even as a regular film,but as a T&A film,and this is the worst,lamest,crappiest and most awful movie i've seen.the acting,story and music are all terrible,not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the T&A connisuer.it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost!|1
I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. They just don't make shows like this anymore, do they?|1
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy ' adventure through an uncharted cave in the Karoo, South Africa. It was a Saturday afternoon in September 2009. A group of young cavers, along with a friend of one of them, had spent a day climbing the Karoo Mountains. They'd spent much of the day drinking beer, and then set off into the depths of the wilderness to explore a new cave. They weren't looking to venture into uncharted caves. They had no real clue as to what lay inside.|0
I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987.|1
Helen ( Kate Capshaw ) owns a bookstore in the sleepy , coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea . When a mysterious stranger arrives, she’s thrilled to learn she’s been selected to be one of ten new authors selected for the New York Book Festival . But Helen is shocked when she’s informed her novel will be rejected . And when the mysterious man reveals his real identity and he tells Helen that her book will be his, she’s shocked to discover she’s about to be rejected again .|0
"The title, although singular, will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this ""thing"" has absolutely nothing to do with ""Freaks"" or even with the art of professional film-making in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. Yeah right The person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe!"|1
I can't express enough just how bad this film was. First of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well I guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. The script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. I imagine maybe if I saw this back when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst.|1
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand . I was intrigued for the first whole movie . What was it about ? Did I like it ? Did I like it enough to keep watching? I guess I'll have to find out . The film started out very interesting , as usual . There were so many characters that I had no idea what to think about at all . There were some great scenes and I was glad to be watching something with a good cast , and not a bunch of idiots .|0
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family : the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Maggie Smith) was sexually abused by her brother Michael, who took advantage of her as she had no choice but to follow him as he would do whatever was required. After leaving the army to work as an estate agent, she married Michael in an arranged marriage. Michael left her and his family, and she moved away from the family, living in various places until she found work as a secretary in her brother's business.|0
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. He hides out in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles.|1
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such,there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more.|1
Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution , one should sit back and enjoy the challenge. I have to admit, as a child, I loved the challenge. But it is so easy to solve and, as I have learned in life, you only get one chance to do it right. This is the perfect game for the younger players to enjoy. This is a great game for any gamer or anyone who enjoys the challenge. This puzzle game has been made for kids who enjoy playing games.|0
I went into this movie determined to like it . I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street , Glen Gary, Good Will Hunting and this is the kind of drama you can watch at night and still feel emotionally involved. But this is really just a film you can watch the next day or even later and not be bored. It has no real plot and you’re just left to just enjoy the movie. If this film has a problem in my mind , it is that the film is very confusing . There are so many characters that it’s impossible to figure out what is going on.|0
Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldn't wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn't need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary.|1
This movie totally sucked ! ! ! Do n't even rent it ! You 'll hate it ! The plot was so retarded and the acting was so fake ! ! ! It was a dumb movie ! And the movie was too long ! First, there's the problem with this film: the acting is very bad. They do a good job of making you feel that the main character isn't really in the mood. I didn't want him to be mad. But I also wanted him to say that he is mad at her, but he isn't.|0
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here.|1
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 ( Dir-Brett Thompson ) : Silly , juvenile-focused movie about three kids in their early teens getting into trouble with their school. 11th watched 9/30/2004 - 2 out of 10 ( Dir-Brett Thompson ) : One of his most famous and popular movies, about a guy trying to win his girlfriend back by giving away a valuable piece of his car. 11th watched 8/6/2004 - 2 out of 10 ( Dir-Brett Thompson ) : His first movie ever made, and the film that made him famous. The main character was an idiot who gets in an accident and ends up in a mental institution.|0
An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! All in all, it's pretty silly stuff. I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects.|1
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table.|1
"This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. ""The Stupids"" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great.In order to appreciate ""The Stupids"", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: ""I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime."""|1
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely associates.Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes.|1
Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one of America's most famous bad guys, a man who has been arrested on the suspicion of being a murderer and is currently behind bars. In this version of the series, it is made clear that the man behind the kidnappings is a member of the Sheik's family. The two kidnappers are the one who kidnap the widow, while the kidnapper that takes out the bodyguard is the one the Sheik wants. In the first season of the series it is made clear that there was a family connection.|0
In Thailand , the Americans Connor ( Colin Egglesfield ) and his girlfriend Amanda ( Meredith Monroe ) quarrel in the bar when they discover that Amanda has gone missing. Connor decides that he has to make Amanda's disappearance as much of a spectacle for their friends and the Thai media as he can. He begins to stalk and stalk, in order to get at her, until finally Amanda's body turns up in the river along with a note that says she was murdered. The case has attracted the attention of the French police and it becomes the centre of an international investigation.|0
"Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? Great actors...Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `A List' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after having liked ""Angels & Insects"" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was."|1
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie.|1
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting locales, great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one.Sadly, Andrew Keir has passed on & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series many times yet a DVD release is yet to happen.The series is one which is timeless. It is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day.|1

"First and foremost I 'd like to state - for the record - that it 's incredibly dumb to call people stupid, especially when their actions tell you so. That's not to say I don't think some people are stupid, just to say that I don't know any of them. I'm not trying to call anyone dumb, just stating the obvious, and stating that I do know a couple of stupid people. (That being said, when I'm talking stupid to myself and saying ""he's stupid"" I don't know how many times I've said it."|0
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen . It just was n't funny . My wife is so afraid to see the film. It is a horror movie. The acting was not good enough . The editing was good . But overall it did not do well at the box office . It will probably take another 50 million dollars to recieve a better budget . And to recive that money it would have to recieve it on the best terms that can be achieved . And the best way of recieving that budget would probably be if it is not an American made film .|0
Sam O'Steen , the film editor on the superlative suspense flick `` Rosemary 's Baby '' from 1968 , here takes us along on his roadtrip through the movie's back alleys. The movie's opening scene shows O'Steen standing behind an office in the middle of a big-box store, watching through the window as an employee goes to his boss's desk and says in a low voice: `` You'll have to excuse me, Mr. O'Steen, I'm terribly sorry you're here, I've had to go to the movies today.''|0
If you 're looking for a typical war movie , this is not it , so a note to all: this is just a trailer . The movie has no plot . There is nothing in the trailer that gives us any indication about the content of the movie . I will also add , that I would strongly discourage you from looking for this title on Amazon , because they will most likely remove it from your shopping cart after you see the title. I've been told this many times now. I have had similar experiences with Amazon and others .|0
1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 ( Dir-Brad Sykes ) : Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much makes you forget that it actually is a movie. If you can't remember it from a previous viewing, you probably aren't going to like this one. The acting is fine and the story, while it doesn't really do anything spectacular, is actually pretty well made. Unfortunately, it's not so much of a bad movie but more a case where things have gone horribly wrong from the very beginning.|0
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. The characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.About an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh ""oh, that is really stupid."""|1
This movie was made by Daiei Studios , known for its Gamera movies . It is about a samurai lord who fights against an alien invasion . He has a daughter who is trapped by the alien . And his only chance to save her is by saving the world , by destroying the invaders . And in the end , he finds that he can do it only if he is also the son of the aliens . That is when the alien gets her . And the son is not a good person because of the alien . And the lord finds out about his father's son .|0
Okay it is terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. C'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman, and, my personal favourite, Roger Ready. Yes, B star John Agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a NASA experiment gone awry. The movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting.|1
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it, I expected quite a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly.|1
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It is VERY cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean I believe a guy I know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It is that bad. I noticed the name from whence this cameAsylumand I will NEVER rent anything with that name on it again!!!|1
One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Coming, that the actors and actresses will do what is necessary to represent that which is most important to them. We have seen some great performances by the cast of the film in the past two days. This is no film that is going to make money. This film is not going to make a profit. But that doesn’t mean that the story is going to be compromised in order for the film to make enough money to pay for the cost of the actors to be paid.|0
"This rendition of ""Noah's Ark"" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. However, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in ""how not to make a movie""Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:""Ok, boys, let's saddle up."" ""It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night."""|1
"The movie opens with Charlie ( Jeff Daniels ) , a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood cafe, to find two young men coming in. “What brings you in, sonny?”

“The police!” he declares, and the two young men rush across the street to the cafe, only to see a man holding a gun aimed at them. “You don’t want to do that, do you!”

Charlie is shocked when the guy says, “It’s not what you think!”

“Who is it?”

“The police!"|0
"This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV performances and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work. There's even a few shots from ""Son Of Dracula"". This movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed."|1
Watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau.|1
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy 's books and seen most of the movies based on them, let me tell you this: I'm in awe of her talent. She can write as well as she can draw. She's as good a storyteller as anyone, and I think that's the reason I love her so much. If you're looking for an art director, I say go find her, because you'll never be able to look at someone who has that much ability and not be impressed. Her books are great and they're just the beginning.|0
"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might."|1
"I do n't know what it is exactly , but the film is happily sitting on my shelf , with no interest in replacing it. Not that I've seen it before or anything :p

""There are times, of course, that you should listen to someone you like, just because they say the right words. For me, though, it is not about what you see. It's about what you feel""

I'm still not sure that's what it's about, even if I know what the author means."|0
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1  Cheap looking villains. 2  Perfectly timed one-liners. 3  Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4  The hero hooking up with the hot chick.|1
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another ? GIANT cgi versions of these creatures are used in many films. GIANT GIANT GIANT. This movie is Hilarious. It is fun to watch two different creatures fight one another. All of them look like giants, but they have a different appearance than their real life size. This scene is awesome ! The movie itself was very good, but I do have to say this is the funniest movie ever made. This movie is Hilarious. Two creatures are going to face off.|0
i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it. i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ? i finally did watch with that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the film. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film.|1
"This was a random rental at the video store . But I was impressed from the start . Wooden Camera Case, Camera Case and other stuff. It was a very nice case that was well designed, and it was very well priced at the time. The customer service staff was very helpful and polite . I was very impressed with this company . I will recommend them to my friends . Lorenzo2016-12-12T00:00:00Z

Ho Hum . Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and killing aliens for a paycheck . It’s actually a great flick , even though they didn’t get their money’s worth . I actually liked it , and I thought the end was awesome . This film has some pretty interesting ideas , and Seagal is a pretty cool guy . He has a real sense of humour . Some of the stuff he was doing with the aliens were pretty cool . It was a really unique take on the Aliens genre .|0
"I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I found NO enjoyment in this movie. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. It is definitely not in the same category as ""The Cave"" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made."|1
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River , near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. The river was so cold that I froze in the water and my mom tried to save me by going to the hospital to get me a blanket, which I promptly ripped off of her. I had just had my hair cut and I knew I looked like a little boy. We had had a movie night that night at my sister's house , and she brought her boyfriend , who was in the movie as a producer, along with his little brother.|0
First, and foremost, I take issue to the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they are referring is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but I assure you, it is singular in Spanish.Next, I thought this movie had been done years ago. It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been kind of scary.Let's talk about the special effects.|1
My Take : Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller , even a good action thriller needs to have a strong lead actor. I can understand if they would not want him to do a lead in this thriller . But if they thought that the lead should be an average actor like Brad Pitt, the lead is already done , it's just an action thriller for Steven Seagal . I guess that if it is not done then it doesn't deserve to have an actor at the forefront , just like the other action thriller movies .|0
A beautiful film. One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed. Made me think about death but not fear it, think about life but not hide from it. A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell. A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost, but no sadness graced my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony!|1
WARNING: PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality.|1
Rachel and Chuck Yoman ( Valerie Harper , Gerald McRaney ) , decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their two young children to return. However, after an accident, their lives are changed forever, and they discover they are a part of an incredible family - the Yoman’s: children and grandchildren born from a series of miscarriages, adopted by them when their own parents died. They are a remarkable family, but also a family of secrets - secrets that will not be denied, and the families of many others.|0
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who Mrs Payton is desiring to blow the joint with. There is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that Burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the Payton tramp.|1
"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years..."|1
For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to `` Rosemarys Baby '' is one big mistake that will not be overlooked. In this case, I would not be that harsh on the film because of the cast who was great, but I do wonder what would have happened with the film if someone else wrote it. Also, the acting was great and the film could have been great had they worked together and they did. This is not even close to a great film, at least from what I have heard, I don't see anything great about the movie.|0
"When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento."|1
"My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. Blame that on shows like ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series."|1
"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful."|1
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski 's trilogy , it seems obvious that in this particular case , too, one must take seriously all of the difficulties and all of the contradictions. It is only a small step from such an attitude to the whole Kieslowski's project . So I will discuss the whole Kieslowski's trilogy at this time . In the first part of the trilogy : 'The Man of the Moment' ' , the central character of the play is a young man who falls in love with a girl who is an object of the love of his childhood.|0
I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech.|1
"The title does n't make much sense to me . I 'm not sure what door in the movie should have the title written on it

I'm actually a little confused by the title because I think it might have to do with the fact that the whole story has to make sense. If you read the book you get a very clear understanding of the situation, but if you don't it'll be a mess."|0
This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts . It suits them well . It’s a great way to make them feel good about themselves or to teach them to be more responsible for their own actions . Kids don’t like that stuff, but I see it all the time. If you don’t put on a face mask and put on a smile, you’ve lost the attention of the people around you and they’ll think it’s because you’re not doing the right thing, or you think you’re not being as cool as others.|0
I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work . It only took a couple of scenes before I gave up . The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the writing isn’t any better. If this movie has any chance of being a good film it has to have great acting and an excellent storyline. So I can only assume the acting was the problem. A few actors I’m not so fond of have played the main villain in this movie and I think they deserve a better fate .|0
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site.|1
"""The next Karate Kid"" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and charming and I cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie."|1
The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.The movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town.|1
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection -- - hilarity , truth , fun and a good time. It was so much fun, I am looking forward to seeing it again. It was a total blast to watch. I've never before laughed so hard, or made fun of myself like I did in this movie. It's not just a comedy -- it is so much more! I can't express how hilarious, funny and entertaining the entire thing is. You will not soon forget it and if you do, you will definitely be back to watch it again!|0
Okay it is terribly , and I mean terribly , easy to pick apart this film . C'mmon what do you want ? That this film is so well made ? And I'm not going to make excuses, I want this film. It is so much fun, it just makes me smile, it's so lighthearted, it just brings you into it , and I'm not just talking just that it makes you feel , but it has the feeling of being in an amusement park. I love this film . It's just perfect, I love every second of it .|0
Peter Strauss , by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of the attention that’s focused on his work. I don’t doubt the quality of his films, but I also don’t doubt the quality of the attention given to him by critics. When I see his work, my first thought is usually, “What’s that?” So when it comes time to give his work to people for review and analysis, I ask myself — is this a good thing?|0
"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. ""Greg, stop clowning! "", scolds Dr. Brandon."|1
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who' history as its most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-rate new Doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant.|1

I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts , and to be honest , I did n't know what I was getting into !! My sister is currently driving to a wedding and my mother is in the hospital recovering from an operation due to a massive fall. I have always been very protective about my sister , who is currently 16, so I'm very excited about this opportunity . The first lesson is very small , I should probably learn a bit more and then go to a couple of places of my own choice.|0
I must admit that I did n't get around to seeing this movie in the theater . As it was on the shelf for months , I didn't think about it much but now that I have , I must admit that this movie got me interested . The title is a play on the name of a book that I'm reading at the moment. I'm currently on page 5 and it keeps getting closer to its final page. As I start to read it I think of the film. I can see why this movie could be interesting.|0
"The MTV sci-fi animated series ""Æon Flux"" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all."|1
"mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called ""wine except"" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin."|1
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the characters he portrays on set than Crudup might be. The movie is one of those movies that, at its heart, is about how good a team you have is. And how you can get better as you learn. And you have to give the team, especially in a fight, the best chance they have. It's about how you have to make them feel like it's real, but you can't make them do anything.|0
This is the worst of the toxie series by far . The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can't tell when a character is actually a real person as they act the way that they usually act and it makes everything seem like they were really there . I was hoping for a good sequel to Tokyo but this one is so bad I gave the entire thing a pass . It's like the writers just didn't have time to come up with good ideas after Tokyo . It's a shame it has to end this way as it was a great series and a very entertaining one to watch .|0
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - SHOCK - it's an X-File.To me - it's cool that Scully/Mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).Oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? Or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work.|1
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today . Many consider just two out of the year 's best picture, 'Annie Hall' and 'The Dark Knight' as among the greatest ever to emerge from Hollywood. If this is true, then it also seems true that these films represent the best we've ever seen in Hollywood, which would be an entirely new benchmark to set. It seems that 'Annie Hall', which has won a total of eight Academy Award nominations, is the most likely candidate as the first film of any kind to get a nomination.|0
If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated.|1
I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience!|1
If you 're looking for a movie that 's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the title of a film, then there's not a single film on earth that I would recommend, not to mention you will probably get a few laughs at least once. If you want a serious comedy, though, you'll want to go to The Hangover Part III. Now to explain why this movie is so funny, because it isn't... The premise of The Hangover is that all of the players in the movie are famous, or at least, famous people.|0
I think I can safely say ( without really giving anything away ) , that this movie had no robots, no robots, no robots. I just think it was such an awesome movie with all the robots fighting and winning, and not just the robot fighting. I also think I can say that the robots look great. They are really good looking. And they looked really cool, and did the job, and did it well, and did it really well. I really enjoyed the robots in this movie. If you didn’t like the robots, you should have probably left.|0
A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don't bring in an aura about them.What was so brilliant about Nagre(Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character?|1
Please ... if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie , if it can be called that, I think you will find it interesting ... I don't know who said this but I just thought it was a fine comment. I have always thought that the story was very well told and the acting is superb. What is the problem with this film, and how does it detract from what was already well done? Is this just me, or is there more of a problem than I understand. Can somebody please explain to me what it is the problem with the movie?|0
Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing.|1
Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed.The plot centres around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. In order to do so, he teams up with a clan of Ninjas, led by three masters  gold lamé ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants.|1
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey's character DIck Harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either.|1
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film ! But do you know how this film would be without the help of its talented cast and crew ? You will get to know more about this film as the film is going through some changes as well as a sequel. In this movie, we will be taking you step by step on a journey from start to finish. This is the film that will make you go beyond the expectations you are going to experience in this movie. This film revolves around a family.|0
Okay , I grew up on Who , but have n't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker . Christopher Eccleston's turn as the First Doctor, was a disappointment , with a mediocre storyline , plot holes , bad character development , poorly written script , and poor writing . I really did not care for him at all . It is sad to see him leave the show at this point but , I still love the character. He is not the greatest Doctor, but he was and is a character that I really liked . So , in short , no Doctor ever made me not love the character !|0
Wow ! It 's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode . Ice is one of the best things to ever grace this channel, and we are so honored that she is here to help out the show ! We feel like an old married couple as we talk about the best parts of the show, with a huge helping hand from Ice . We also get to find out more about her, including the fact that she's a bit of an animal magnet ! She also reveals all the things that make her unique, including the fact that ice is also an avid hiker .|0
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig.|1
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book . As written by Rafael Sabatini , this movie does not even try to be a comedy but just a bad thriller. I really didn’t see the movie with my own eyes , but what I have read said that there is no fun in watching this movie. I was expecting some good twists in this film but there was just one twist which I did not expect at all. It was a very slow movie , it just dragged on for too long.|0
A MUST SEE documentary. -- -- -This movie had so many things to consider while watching it . It was a very well put together documentary on a number of things that affected us in one way or another. -- -- It will change your life! -- - I watched it over two nights at a restaurant. I didn't care about any of the facts that were there. I just had to feel the story through my body and let it wash through my senses. - I think the movie is so well put together that it makes you stop and think.|0
"Of all the movies in the history of movies I can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called ""Breeders."" Lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of ""It Came from Outer Space"" instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds?"|1
"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and aired. I would ask the producers, ""What were you thinking? Were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?"""|1
First , let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is . So the book may have been based on her work . I know nothing of her . I don’t even know who her mother is! . If I’ve seen something wrong with this review, then feel free to ask me anything in the comments . . I just want to make sure that it is correct. . . Now here is where this review takes a very different direction from the rest. . . I don’t see anything wrong with the movie at all .|0
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing . The DVD cover looked like it had been ripped straight out of an 80's horror flick. I could never watch this movie again. I've never understood why people say that horror movies are for the squeamish, and this movie was no different. If you're squeamish, then I'm sure you'll have a great time. If you aren't squeamish, then I sincerely hope you'll give it one more chance before giving up entirely.|0
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. This is what happens when a pair of film stars decide to do a stupid and dangerous stunt in a very public place in the hope of getting some money out of some rich people. They are later arrested and fined, and then both are fined. The film opens in a town in France, where a group of young men – including Wagner and Wood – are out at a shooting range when they are told not to fire their weapons.|0
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood , and this nearly doubled that, so I was really excited and anxious to see what the filmmakers had in store for me. I don't think I was disappointed, but I did get the sense that I was going to have a few rough spots. As the movie begins, it's immediately obvious that the world we're dealing with is not a place that most people are familiar with, or even believe that they have a right to their own opinions.|0
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer due to this film. I have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. I would rather watch Star Crystal....... Holy cow maybe that is not a good example. The main question I have about this film is... Was it to be a morality film?|1
I can't believe I even tried to watch this filth. As an avid B-Horror movie fan, I was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, I could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of.|1
Okay , anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film . A sophisticated film , but one which should be watched to the end . I have watched this film so many times in the past few years . I just watched it this morning . This film , in spite of being a big box-office success , seems to have been somewhat under appreciated in the last few years . It has received a lot of mixed reviews and a few bad reviews of it . This film doesn’t seem to be as good as the original but it seems to be a much better looking film .|0
Like a lot of people , I loved the original ; `` American Graffiti '' was one of the great movies that I saw when it came out ; and I thought it should have gotten an Oscar for the art department. It was a great time for all types of people, and that's what movies are all about : bringing the people who love to movies together. As you can imagine , I'm very proud of my work here. I am very thankful for all my friends and colleagues who support me through this great journey ; and they are always the first to support what we do !|0
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but they were just as sick as the horror movies. But these were the movies that would make you cringe and laugh at the same time. The slasher flicks of the 80s were much worse than the ’90s slasher films and they still made you feel sick. They still made you laugh. But what made the ’90s and the 80s horror movies so much worse, is that it was the characters. The villains were the bad guys, it was the good guy, it was the hero.|0
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a lower class Northern British setting. I find it a very sad film at parts, at others cuts are where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie. I only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end.This movie completely loses the attention of the audience.|1
What on earth happened to RGV ? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to do a serious study to see where it is coming from. So I thought I would write a review on it to see if others agree with me. So here goes.... This is a movie that is not really a good movie, but for me, the only way to sum up everything wrong about it would be to state that it is not a very good movie. I do not even know who wrote the movie. I have only seen the trailer.|0
If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing and more a film with a message, you should go to see “The Dark Knight Rises.” “The Night Manager” is not the film that I would have expected to see, but it is still a damn good movie about a character who is willing to make the wrong choices in order to protect those who need protecting. The night manager, played by Christian Bale (“American Sniper”), is just that: a character.|0
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past.|1
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.We saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive.|1
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. The two whom show up fall in love. The 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out. Okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together..slightly weird here...Harry Carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick.|1
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to experience firsthand. The experience will be both educational, and inspiring, and will leave you with an in depth understanding of how life on the bottom operates and why you should never dive there again. It is the story of what happens when we leave the confines of our houses, and go out into the deep to explore a place we are only just beginning to understand. We will dive beneath the sea to explore a world we don't know yet, but will find out what we have never seen.|0
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest , most off-putting , but most wonderful Broadway musical . It was made for Broadway but not for touring, because the cast had to learn the songs and act in order to go on tour. It's been produced on Broadway three times, and it ran for over seven years before closing on June 28, 1971. I had never heard of the show but I knew I was going to see it, just because it was a musical. The show was based on a book written by the writer of The Producers.|0
I do n't know where to begin . Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen after a series of miscommunications or bad luck. I'm sorry that i'm posting this on a message board and not my own site. The problem is that most people in this country are too stupid to read a plot summary before the movie begins. They think that this is a popcorn movie, like most movies are, and it's supposed to be entertaining from start to finish. Not to worry though. The plot summary was good.|0
You ca n't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money . Most of the actresses I saw in the film are in their 20's and I saw the best acting that I'd seen in a long time. I just wish it hadn't taken so long, the picture looks amazing and the special effects are great. All in all a very good picture. Wow...you really need to rewatch this movie. I think you're the only one who saw this during the run.|0
I 'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie . Do n't get me wrong , it is a good movie , a must see , but it has some negatives , in my opinion. 1) Not very original or unique plot . The book is quite interesting in the fact that it is a real person who has a lot of dreams and fears . But the plot , the characters and the story is very generic . There are some minor variations on the plot that add to the generic feel of the whole thing .|0
"Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever for leaving. The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming ""Exterminate"" then)."|1
One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.|1
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced one really good episode...The Damned Thing...it is still early, I have faith that the episodes will get better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline. The episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring, but the last fifteen minutes was really good. Though, I am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed. Please, save this season John Carpenter!|1
Eve is an eye opener , because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds , we all want to know about Eve and how is she , and how is the movie about this. This is not a simple movie , this is a great sci-fi, adventure story, and the world is amazing. If you are not into sci-fi , then you should start with this movie. This movie is beautiful , it is the best sci-fi adventure , you should see it. The first time i saw it , i felt like I had watched a dream and a movie for real.|0

Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are trying to tear your hair out and force you to do what the vampire wants. Are you brave or are you stupid? You don't know if you're going to survive the next few minutes or you could be dead in minutes. In the middle ages many of Europe's people had no access to modern technology like computers. They had to rely on their wits and the only way to keep from being eaten was to fight.|0
...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance.|1
In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short , we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed `` Serpentine Dance '' as her first step in what promises to be a very important new dance in the world of the musical theater. For those who are not familiar with Annabelle Moore, her character in this show might be as difficult to understand as her acting. For all of the dancing, the character seems to have no idea what to do with her feet. The dance is just too abstract for most people to comprehend. So it is not surprising that most people do not like it.|0
**Spoiler* It gives away the very irrelevant ending**At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But, then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 galloner.|1
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based purely on Flex being in this movie. I have never seen him in anything not worth while. True to form this movie delivered for me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie a lot. I didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should have detailed.|1
What an awful movie . Full of cliches , perplexing scenes , very bad acting , and an atrotious script . The only thing that will bring it back into my life will be to rewatch this film and find a way to avoid it. This is the first time in my lifetime that I have seen this one. I had heard of it but it was too late for me to catch the last movie that I had watched. That was a few years ago when the movie was just released. I was really excited when I heard about the release of the film.|0
Pretty twisted Horror film , that has a few good moments here and there , with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes and a bunch of other good horror related scenes , not to mention an interesting story . A man wakes up in the woods with nothing but his wits , and the only clue he had left was his dog which was with him at the time he was bitten by a wolf . As time passed the man began to realize that his dog was not his dog , but the dog in question , and that it could not have been him .|0
Solo is a poor film - that can not be ignored . The acting for the most part is very good , and the story, while it is good , it is a little lacking in the story line. It has its moments , and it has it's flaws . The acting is one of the best I have seen for the past few years, and it has been quite well received by the critics . The story lines are entertaining , the special effects are well done, and there are some funny moments , but there are also moments where the story line gets boring .|0
What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster ? Not that much . With the average rating of an R on Metacritic the movie has average reviews on IMDb . While there is not much more you can do , there is one very good movie that has a great story and good acting . But it is the story that is missing . This is a very good movie which you would not expect . The story is about a cross dresser and his gangster buddy . I am sure you would be very intrigued by this story .|0
This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.Dont come to this movie expecting the Matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie.|1
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen . On a par with Blair Witch, I was not sure how much I could take. I knew I was going to give this one a 2.0 . I won't give anything else away, because this is just the beginning . I hope you watch this one because this is a movie that you can't put down . You don't have to see this one, I'll wait and see if anyone else finds it enjoyable. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a movie that I don't think I could ever enjoy.|0
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I 've ever encountered . The dialogue is trite and clichéd . I am glad it is only a one-time exposure but the fact it is in the movie is just ridiculous . This is one of the few films I would not watch because it makes me sick. I think the only redeeming thing is that the ending was very touching. I am a huge fan of Disney and if I was given the chance to do this I would never give up on their films . I just finished watching the first episode.|0
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. It is full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand next to lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good.|1
"Two years after 'Airplane ! ' took off , Jim Abrahams , Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its most memorable and iconic performances in 'HBO's ""The Wire.""' The show was based on a true story of a drug bust gone bad by a group of criminals known as the Vice Lords. ""We had to do the whole episode with a gun,"" Abrahams says. ""The Vice Lords were such a famous group, and we knew they would have guns, and I didn't know they would be armed."|0

`` Eaten Alive '' goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato 's `` Cannibal Holocaust , '' but it 's still a pretty good book about the human spirit in times of hunger. I like it. There are a few characters in there that have been written into my brain since I 've read this book, but the book itself is not about the characters, or the setting, or what you might call the 'real' events and characters that happened in Italy during this period. In fact, there is very little to say about Italian-American history outside of the characters and the events.|0
This was it ! i would have never expected the ending if i did n't already know the behind the scenes. i know it will not be like that in real life and it was not intentional but i had a great time watching this. also i could not have watched it through the internet due to copyright restrictions. and i would like to thanks all the fans who support us on the web, i am also glad to see we are getting new fans on this channel. also i thank you all for the kind wishes and good thoughts we have.|0
"And one of 'em are bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. This is not the Dante-directed ""Piranha"" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as ""Piranha, Piranha."" A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece."|1
"""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.The film concerns a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (Alan Curtis) run off and get married."|1
The Calu-what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name as well. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. Starting off with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well I can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. Poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever.|1
We 've all got to start somewhere , it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Michael Caine did it for us , now that they are on the screen , we don't have to go through all that again , you know what I mean . We just want to get on with it and enjoy it . We have all got to have some laughs , even if it's just for 15 minutes or however long we are allowed to do this , and we have to have as many as possible , because we are in the business of watching movies .|0
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like. Most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it adds up to make a perfect story. All the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough.|1
"It 's about jealousy , it 's about racism , it 's about manipulation , but the underlying message is a good one , it 's about what you 're thinking , not what 's being done , or what they 're telling you , not what 's real . I know how you feel
I know how I felt
I 'm the one that went down
I 've gone down on you . But you 're still up here , and that's what I want , for you to see
And I'm the one that goes down , and that's all I want ."|0
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.|1
"The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel , by Arthur Bernède , from 1927 . Not much can be found about it online except for a very short synopsis . ""In a small house in southern France, there are five young people who are living a quiet and secluded life, in spite of the presence of an invisible monster who has been living here for many years. The main character, a doctor, has an affair with the woman’s mother, who in return takes advantage of her husband’s weakness."|0
I'm not really sure where to begin. From start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob.|1
"It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Maybe the one true genius artist of British Film to emerge out of the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer-aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems and governmental solutions. Thus, his work is probably less ""filmic"" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality."|1
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! How can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? Maybe part II will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! I have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!|1
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana , 1927 's Sur un Air de Charleston is a beautiful film made from a single reel of film. A young girl (Charleston) is looking to leave her life of slavery but she is caught up in a world of prejudice and discrimination. The film follows her attempts to escape the prejudice and discrimination of her past. Sur Un Air de Charleston will have your jaw hanging open when you discover what the film was all about, and will leave you wanting to come and see this film.|0
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber. The film makers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie, and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory collection of poppycock. I almost started rooting for the mexicans, just to get the damn thing to end.|1
`` Landscape after a battle '' opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather a strange place, at that. In fact, there are a couple of very well-written and well-written sequences to get you hooked, but they aren't quite enough to convince that you need to keep watching. You don't want to watch them, you want to keep reading them to understand better what happened. There are a few interesting sequences in this game, but they aren't what I'd call a must-see in this game.|0
"I loved this show . Such talent ; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only a year and half

I’m a huge fan of the show, and I just had to comment and give my opinion on the cancellation. I was very disappointed because I’ve watched the series for years, and I am very much in agreement with those who have written here who have said it is the best show on TV. I will be the first to agree, because it is one of the most compelling shows you will ever see."|0
Another sequel! Why on earth do they keep making these? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only watched so I could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... That's basically it. The acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think.|1
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Have it scripted by a 10 year old. Have the acting done by A-Level drama students faking really bad US accents (in the Isle of Man!) Add monster special effects that the lovers of B&W Dr Who shows will appreciate. Result: duff film. Throw in Samantha Janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!|1
"""Mr. Bean"", starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was around ten, shortly after it ended, so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes!"|1
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up. what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie?|1
"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER."|1
Got to confess right up front that I did n't watch this entire movie . I missed the first hour. I had to rewind it a few times just so I could keep up with the story, but I didn't get into it that much at that point. But, it still left me wanting more, and I'm hoping it's just as good as the first two movies. The first movie I've seen so far, I had no problem getting into it. From the moment I saw the trailer I really was hooked.|0
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s ( Casper Gutman , Signior Ferrari , Mr. Peters , Jerome Cowan), his career as an opera singer has always been in a steady state since he started working in the 1960s. During that decade he performed all around Europe, but not much else. He didn't perform the big roles in the classics of the past, but he did sing many small ones. His last appearance on the scene was on the opera stage of the Met, where his singing was very good, but not great.|0
When I first watched this film , I thought that it would be rally good , because it featured my favorite actors , I think it’s something that I’m looking forward to watch more of because I really enjoyed this film and I’m glad that I saw it. It’s been a year now since this film was originally released, which has left a big gap for me, I was expecting to see some changes in the story and I was expecting this film to fall into the typical romance type of movie.|0
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck.|1
Normally , I do not review online , but it 's Saturday and I 'm trapped in my room , with my laptop on the counter. So, I can do nothing , until it gets here! I 've been to my computer before , so I know how to get it to come up , but I do not know what to do from here ! So, please help . I want my laptop to come up on time , please ! Thank you . Well, if you don't have to, just make sure it comes up after you start the computer and you're connected to internet.|0
The Toxic Avenger , hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly better and more bizarre the second you get a close look. It all begins, as they say, with an evil clown. We first saw the clown in the first Deadpool comic in early 2014, right as he was making his way to China. It’s something you can see very well here, if you don’t want to buy the comic. If you buy the comic, you can also see a very well-done trailer.|0
"After the failure of ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth,"" the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs UNDER 90 minutes... On display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched B-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while STILL attempting to keep the whole project completely serious."|1
"This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in a local park. I am not a criminal myself and I don't know why this documentary is being made. There seems to be much more to it. I just thought it was a little bizarre to see the same guy being questioned about this in an interview with the same journalist. For example:

The journalist says that he has seen the video. Why would he? The kid in the video says he doesn't remember that. What does this mean?"|0
I've never understood this type of spoof movies. You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots.|1
When I first saw this movie , I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset , and that there was no way it was going to win at the box office. I was wrong. I think if we had done this kind of film a few years back it would have been a great success . This movie has some of the best acting I've seen in a very long time , and that is saying a LOT . The whole cast is absolutely stunning , and they have a whole lot to do .|0
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it 's even more hated than the last one, it just sucks to watch, i feel for the girl who has to go through it, but the main problem is that it doesn't have much depth, its just like a standard action movie where the girl has to get to the point where the action gets really violent, and then when the action stops, the movie gets really dull. Also i have heard that this movie was the most popular movie that was banned at the cinema, which is also sad.|0
This movie was terrible . The acting was awful . The script was awful . What was even worse were the bad editing . The movie was like that . It felt like a bad movie because it was really bad . I just didn't get the joke. And it's really bad because of that . I wish there was more humor in it . I wish it had some good editing . But that is all I got . I hate the script . It just came out of nowhere . No one was really there to help me out .|0
This is a fantastic film. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching it, I could see parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece.|1
Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in an automobile accident. One can guess the outcome. Gracie receives Bob's wife's heart, although they have no knowledge of each other....yet! A year later, Gracie is feeling like a new person while Bob is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up on a blind date, Bob finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the date occurs.|1
OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well.First off, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Other than those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror.|1
Think Jumanji but with a death curse . A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that's supposed to be their only hope, but it turns out a bunch of strangers is actually going to be the game's only hope. A couple of years ago when I played Jumanji, it was something I would never get my hands on. I liked the idea of playing it on a giant board that you can walk around. I liked how you could move to your right and it would change the world. And it was fun.|0
"OK , so maybe it 's because I 'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like them

It's just like you have a very similar accent to them, no doubt about it, but I have no clue as to what part of Scotland you come from

Click to expand...

No, I'm from Scotland, not North East, and I don't even have a Scottish accent at all. That's just the thing with accents, they're different for each individual. I don't know anything about where your family comes from though."|0
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm, son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up.|1
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes , this entry ( the fourth ) feels tired . Toshiharu Ikeda , who’s been working in the genre for over two decades , is the main figure involved in this film , with Kenichi Kasai handling the rest. The story is mostly set in an unknown town in an unspecified world. A young man ( Shinnosuke Yamamoto ) takes his friend to visit him in the hospital. As they’re making their way up the path, he falls in love with the young lady ( Yuriko Tatsuta ) who is staying in their apartment.|0
This movie was alright . Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters ( sorry for stating the obvious ) who against all odds manage to escape an abusive life in New York and reunite with each other in San Francisco. Both sisters are in love with the same guy but they don`t have the money to go to bed together. In the end they do it anyway and it`s the most incredible thing . The plot is well written with some funny lines . It`s a little bit too long but that doesn`t affect the overall quality .|0
"...I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told ""we need at least 90 minutes"", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. Music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score I've ever heard."|1
"This movie was extremely disappointing , I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy ' but do n't be mislead by its title , there are no laughs , and the story line has no real substance , I just wish it would have been a little shorter

I know that it's probably not the best thing that I have seen , but I'm glad I could watch it. I watched this one on Netflix because I was bored. I thought it would be an extremely funny movie about weed. I thought it would have some substance but it did not."|0
What on earth happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. Every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, I might add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in.|1
This is one awful movie ! ! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I have seen it twice ! ! First time I watched it at midnight I couldnt sleep , second time was in the morning I wanted to sleep ! ! But what the movie is all about ? ! ! I have never seen a movie which made me cry like this and I dont want to see it again ! ! In my opinion it's not a good movie because it is too much violence and it's too slow . ! !|0
Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film 's release for awhile . After finally getting it for free on DVD a couple of years ago , I've been looking forward to watching it ever since . What makes 's release all the better ? 1. It's pretty much what I thought we were going to get . It's pretty much exactly the story we were all expecting . There's a few little things I was expecting that didn't quite deliver as I would've expected , and I'm not really sure what those reasons were . 2.|0
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out . I recall the scariest scene was when the woman and the kids were running across the bridge while the man was in the other boat and he was trying to make his escape and he got caught and killed by the other guy. That guy was really crazy. I couldn't stand him so I just thought it would be a nice movie to see. I remember looking for a DVD and I looked at a lot of them but I never saw it again.|0
As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority , I was n't sure what to expect when I tuned into the Pan-Hellenic event at a local theater. My question was why. But I'm glad I checked in and made my choice. It's one of those events that I always feel the need for a day pass, but not when I want to meet people from all the different Greek organizations. I wanted to see if I would get any feedback on how it is being run. Would there be any groups that were more active than other parties?|0
"Even if you're not a ""theatre person,"" I highly recommend that you see this. Based off of a play of the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing-- by far Sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna."|1
I wo n't spoil it for you . Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled ( you probably could care less because I don't care, so it would be rude if it was spoiling anything for you to care ) . But what's the problem with it? What's so special about it that needs to be spoiled? What is it that you're really afraid of? What is the reason you're afraid of it, and how should I help you overcome it? I can't really explain to you what is the reason for my fear .|0
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. With that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. Well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next Wednesday's episode.|1
I saw this movie with my mother , and I loved it ! It was such a sweet story , and I wanted to read more. But, it took too long . I need to finish this book in the next year . I think it is a great story ! I can't wait to read the sequel. Thank you, for the opportunity to review this book! It was well worth the wait! It is the second in a series of three, set during World War I, and revolves around the fate of the men and women in the French Resistance.|0
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England. It is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'Technical Aspects' of the IMDb site.|1
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie and the trailer came on for the episode. It was very, very cool because I was like, ""Oh my gosh! This is the show!"" It was the first time people actually talked about anime, and I loved that. Now, I watch the show on occasion and there are times when I just go, ""This is so awesome."" It's like, ""I wish I could just be a normal kid and watch this."""|0
"Are you kidding me ? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the music coming out the speakers. And that was my first show of this year too. The sound was terrible. I'm sorry, but I can't take any more music coming out of the speakers. This is what it sounded like:

I saw it, I enjoyed it, I wanted it to be there. What was so special about this show is that it really did not come out as much of a show as it could have, especially with the sound quality."|0
"It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids and even Superman II and Superman Returns. However, the more one looks at the film, the funnier it gets. The film starts off slow and builds to an unstoppable momentum which makes it a very enjoyable watch! Synopsis:

From Warner Bros comes the new and improved Superman, the most beloved and beloved of all superheroes, a man whose adventures have spanned decades, who has come to be known as one of the greatest super-men of all time."|0
This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975.|1
Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator Bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film. That said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance.|1
Kazuo Komizu strikes again with `` Entrails of a Beautiful Woman '' , the sequel to `` Entrails of a Dog '' , which he co-wrote with Takeshi Obata . The movie is based off of the first novel of the series . The story starts off in an alternate timeline in which humanity has evolved to the point that they can control animals and humans can evolve to the point of being able to control people as well. The film also shows how the history of humans and humans evolves as the planet evolves and the world becomes aware that a group of humans that escaped from an experimental experiment have developed a new technology.|0
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a great movie and I loved it. I think its one of the best films i've ever seen! I've seen the trailer but I haven't seen the film yet. I think its something special and should be screened at some of your local cinemas. I'm still trying to find a good place where it can be shown at, though I did find one that screened it for a movie festival a while ago but it was too much of a hassle to show at a local theatre.|0
"It was 1983 and I was 13 . I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were out. They were going out of town, and I wanted to impress them. They had just moved to New Orleans from Chicago. It was the time before cable television became ubiquitous. When my father said, ""You know you want to be in movies,"" I had to think about what he meant . . . I had read Valley Girl and I was fascinated by the concept of making a family. I was interested to see if my parents would let me go and do it ."|0
I have seen this movie three times. Going back to VCR's, in the 1980's, and again on The Encor channel last night (Feb.11, 2010). Based on a true story which I remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, I've decided that I find it too disturbing to watch ever again. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. The creepiest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves little brother. (The story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the Internet -- just Google it.|1
Irvine Welsh's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh, all with a few of Welsh's trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.|1
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart.|1
"Wow. Just wow. Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then i happened to come upon ""Lady Frankenstein"". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on Italian TV, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like i have, as number 24. And lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here."|1
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice.|1
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to a new form of mutated, zombie-like creatures. The film’s star is Robert Pattinson, who starred in both of the Twilight movies, but in this film he plays the character of Nick, who was an unwitting participant in a military experiment that mutated humans. The movie was released in theatres in 2013 and has had a successful theatrical run, as well as being adapted for the big screen, in a 2016 film starring Brad Pitt and Carey Mulligan.|0
This show started out okay , but then it turned into a nightmare . The worst part about it was that I would be sitting there doing my own thing , and all of sudden the song will stop , I would have no idea why, and then there would be silence. Then the song would start up again. And then it would start all over again, and you would be just sitting there watching all of the stupid shit that had happened. And that’s how it felt . There’s just something about it that I’ve never had anything like.|0
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans , in the beginning of the Twentieth Century , the Moroccan society became more and more secular, more and more individualist, less and less religious. In those days the most important symbol of a Moroccan Muslim was not the Koran , but the black cloth known as _barka_ , which is used in a variety of ways in the Morocco of the Twentieth Century : it is not only used as the symbol of Islam , it is also an important element in Moroccan cuisine . This article explains the evolution of Morocco from the medieval times to today.|0
Since the past couple of days I 'm really hooked on the `` Female Scorpion '' series and I keep reading the manga. I have read this manga before but I never know exactly what's going to happen. I found out that she can change her appearance to match her partner and get his attention. She can also do all this while she's keeping a low profile, just like the male scorpion and female tiger do. The male scorpion is able to transform into a female one and stay female. It seems like the female scorpion in the series is much stronger than the male.|0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. This can be pretty annoying.Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to Duchamp's ready mades. What's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Julio Iglesias.|1
'The Dresser ' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like,' said the actress, before adding, 'There's no way anyone could make it worse. There is no other film quite like it.' In the opening sequence of The Dresser, one of the most memorable images from the film, a girl dressed in red is being chased through the woods. She is eventually found by two men and the film's title is used with the tagline, 'The Dresser is a dresser.'|0
Wow ! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy . If the cheap-looking opening credits have any indication, you'll be laughing your heads off the whole time. There's even a hint that this movie is a comedy. But wait, is it? I'm pretty sure the only laugh is coming from the kids, not from the scarecrow itself. I guess it's just a great way to get the kid to laugh and then go on to make the other kids laugh. That would be a good thing. I am so tired of watching scarecrow movies now.|0
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film , it is not until the last act that this play is introduced to the world, and the audience are not sure whether they should follow along or not. It’s also not until the climax of the film that we are given the first indication that this is not just another film about “play”. It’s not until the end credits of the film where we hear the famous line: “The play is just beginning”, that the audience finally get an indication of what is about to unfold.|0
This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades.|1
Low budget mystery . A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. She’s been hit but she is still breathing. There’s no sign of foul play. What happened to the victim? Is this the beginning of a nightmare that will end very soon? The woman is wearing an orange sweater and dark trousers and has a small dog running alongside her. This dog is not very big and the woman is walking with a big stick in her left hand. As she walks, she looks in both directions and then turns and looks at the dog.|0
As kids movie it is great. For the family it just sucks. I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all ages. This movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was however a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka.|1
"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc. ), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of ""Passenger 57"") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker."|1
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character.|1
"Well , the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out ... and they seem to get worse every time . Every time I get to see them I just think , ""I can't believe they can be in so much trouble so easily . I wish they'd just go away and let us live our lives just the way we wish to ."" Well , they are still on the channel and even I am still amazed . I'm sure I will have the chance to see one someday . I wonder if they have ever been killed in any way ?"|0
"I love Umberto Lenzi 's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT STORM series -- the most underrated of his body of work. They were always my favorite when I was a kid but haven't gotten the credit they deserve. Here are four of my favorite desert storms from the Desi series that are still available on DVD:

I have to admit that when I was a kid, I had a hard time imagining a world without sand. We lived in a desert in the Southwest so there were lots of sand storms."|0
"This film reeks of production line planning. It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film does address the age of the Stewart/Allyson performers; though, I'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.There are messages in ""Strategic Air Command"" I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick with one truly wretched element: The happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife."|1
Having watched this movie several times , I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring choice to show a gay man kissing another gay man, and another gay man kissing a female. This leads me to the question: Is it okay? I have never seen this kind of thing in movies before and I think this was a great film to do that. I can see why people liked it. The kissing scenes were also very well done and the ending was also a perfect ending to this film.|0
Sorry I could n't disagree more , with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on . It was an excellent story , I thought it was really interesting and that it was really well written . I thought the setting was well thought out and well written and I was really happy with how it all concluded . If I'd have thought that the conclusion was really over the top I probably would have enjoyed it more. I thought it was a well written story . The only problem I had with the book was that it ended too abruptly .|0
This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, naturally, is larger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and Courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. The period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial.|1
As I said , sometimes low budget is good . You get to see a good movie without a lot of money , it’s better . I also do love to go to cheap places , I mean if you can afford it , there’s no point , it’s not good for you and you don’t like eating there . I’m a simple man , I can’t afford to have expensive places to eat , but I still go there . I remember I had a friend that used to go to the place where he used to go to eat .|0
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance , a tour de force . His acting as supposed washed up beach stud is great . He was at one point in his early 20s. This is great casting , but as a character he needs to show that he is not washed up he is still a man who knows what he wants and he is still a man who is not going to do what he doesn't want to do in life . He is not a role model. I really think he should be given a chance , he's not that old.|0
"""Escape from Hell"" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the ""fake plague"" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it."|1
When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I figured that I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I found still very amusing was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part.|1
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation . This is one of them . Words can not do justice to the absurdity of this film . I'll be honest, the whole thing looks like a parody of a British TV show . All the cast consists of the leading lady and her co-workers in a film set . The film seems to be a parody of a British TV show . It's set to air sometime in the month of August . This is the fourth movie of the year, but we are getting to know the cast a lot faster this year .|0
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early days of animation. It shows how early 20th century filmmakers were experimenting and developing new ideas to try out before they made their film, and how they did it on an industrial scale. We get to see how the animator's hand-drawn art style was being used to develop a new and exciting medium of animation for the American market. And I especially enjoyed watching how this film was made and what kind of production techniques were used to make it.|0

Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense . Unfortunately very little of it does. And that’s before you get into the philosophical questions of ethics and metaphysics. So to help people who have trouble with these questions, here’s some advice on the art of getting it right and making sense of your world. There are two schools of thought on how you should make sense of the world in the first place. One is known as Cartesian dualism, the other the materialist school of philosophy. They both share one thing in common.|0
Like the previous two 'Mad Max ' films , 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ' is not exception to the violence and gore. This time, the film has to be taken more seriously. The scene where the characters are killed is one of the most bloody in the whole film. The blood splatter is well planned, but the scene with the character being shot to death is out of hand. At one point, you get the idea that someone is stabbing the protagonist with his bare hand. After this scene, the character's blood is not splattered on a plate but on a bed.|0
It 's astonishing that some people saw this as art . We saw it as a poorly filmed ( shaky ) drama about a family . This is not true . We are a family ! We are NOT a family drama ! That's why I was thrilled when this movie started to gain so much popularity. I was thrilled when it began getting good reviews. I was thrilled when it was nominated for 7 Academy Awards . And I was thrilled when the movie won 1. This is an honor for me that I was not expecting to receive. Well deserved !!|0
JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects.|1
The subject matter was good , direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major . The film was interesting . The ending was very good , and I loved what happened to Ramdev. I liked the way the film ended and it made me wonder why the film wasn’t a superhit. I did not love the movie at all. But the director did great work and I enjoyed the acting. I felt like the movie was done at a professional level. I enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again. I like this one a lot.|0
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people I know.Great moments between characters  including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. Beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.When watching any film with Maori actors, I've found that I can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life.|1
"I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies I've ever seen. But the makers of ""Overnight"" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's Boondock Saints even about?"|1
"Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and ""heavy on the bottle"" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters)."|1
I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. I don't get the idea, why that kid died? ?Is a cliché, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.LOL.I don't understand what is the connection with the movie... And is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.Nothing new in this movie.|1
Mr. `` Uwe Fail '' strikes again , transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap . Poor timing , and poor decisions , were the reasons the game fell apart from the very first play . The result was a complete debacle that is difficult to believe was not planned from the onset . Now , even if a game is poorly designed , I think that a lot can be gained from it , if not from a good game design . I really don't know what the designers were trying to achieve , or if they actually intended it to work .|0
"Yahoo Serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. It is right up there with ""Lightning Jack"" and ""Les Patterson Saves the World"" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in Australia Yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy."|1
Well I 'm not the world 's biggest Sondheim fan , so although I have the cast album and I love that song the lyrics are in French and not in English and it makes it very difficult for me to listen to that album . It just makes me wonder what I might have done for the best if I didn 't have to listen to it with my wife . I can understand why it 's a little difficult . I remember a while back an old friend of mine and I were on a drive together and he made a joke that it was going to end in disaster.|0
Well it is a good movie . However , you have to admit that Van Dame 's movies have n't been the usual hit with me . in fact, they have been one of those movies I have had my eye on for a while -- but haven 't seen , and now they're coming out soon . this movie starts out with a little girl being chased down a road by a man who thinks that he's the evil monster . he takes the girl and runs her over into the river in a boat .|0
I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the story. I found the ending to be interesting and the ending was well done. But some of the scenes seemed to drag on way to long and I think that some of the scenes might have had too many characters involved for me to be able to really enjoy this movie. I would have preferred if they had kept the character's of the main characters but I suppose that would be a difficult thing to do.|0
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie.|1
This movie is truly unbelievable , in every sense of the word . I could n't believe what I was seeing. It is a masterpiece of acting and the story is great. This movie has it all and I have never seen a movie like this one before , and I think I have seen one of these movies , and this is one of them. Bryan Cranston is one of the all time best actors of my lifetime . The entire movie is worth watching if you like that genre , but I can't help it, this movie is like nothing else I have seen.|0
Although i do n't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago , I still find it a great film and I would give this movie a 9 out of 10 !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!! !!! This movie is about a guy who works in a bar in India. His life takes a twist when he is asked to go to England to meet an old friend and when he reaches England, he falls in love with the woman he will be living with.|0
The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I have n't seen every film released by this studio. They are only films they have had released, and I have. I still have to review a bunch to see if any are worth buying. But you are right that there is no question mark because the studio has released ALL of them and in the last 5 years I have seen about 80 films from them and in that span of time almost ALL have been excellent films, and this is just not true of almost all the rest.|0
What can I say about this ? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End ? Wasted Time , Wasted Money , and Lost Customers. Prestige has a huge responsibility, to do the job, to give all its people the best tools, with the maximum possible attention to what it does. That's why they've spent the last 3 years building it. They've spent a hell of time building it. This is why they've wasted so much money. But, in the end, the people they've built it for deserve some kind words. But, why?|0
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder. Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime.Sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late.|1
Set in the Philipines, Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work.|1
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival ? I understand it got into the Panorama section , and then there is this special section dedicated to documentaries. Does it have to do with the documentary aspect ? What does it add ? Is there another documentary film festival in Germany ? It is in the top five in Berlin. I am not aware of any documentaries that got in the Panorama section. It looks like it was there at the time the film was announced. There are some documentaries in there that I don't know about.|0
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version . In my first attempt at seeing it (as far as I remember, anyway) I remember that it started out with the music sounding a little different than I thought it would be, and then I got stuck in the story. I don't remember much of that part, other than Lynch getting shot and the ending was pretty much like I had expected it to be since I was a little disappointed that the film didn't start with a bang, instead seeming to take a longer time to conclude.|0
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. BBC are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks.Ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written.|1
This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. Straight from the coke-filled gutters of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene.How so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?Get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job.|1
"This film makes several nods to various science fiction films . The prologue reminds me of the one for the original ""Jurassic Park"" (a film that came to me by chance) . In fact there are a few shots in this trailer that resemble the scene in which John Hammond, who's played by Gary Oldman, has just been killed by the creature at the end of the original movie ""Jurassic Park"" . So, I suppose this trailer has to be considered as a ""kind of homage"" to one of the few good Jurassic Park sequels ."|0
This movie could have had a lot of potential . Certainly with today 's technology , one would expect real 3D action . The movie did not have that . The technology was not quite up to the job . The special effects of the movie did not show up on the big screen .The 3D effects on the big screen were not what one could call good . The 3D technology used by Warner Bros in this movie did not have the consistency that was required for a quality movie . Even with the special effects , one could not tell the difference between the real world and the special effects of the 3D world .|0
I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol' Blue Eyes. However, I've never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing. Well...it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine, who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band.|1
I did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. The suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. What kept it going were the good actors.But the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like Tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. Tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min.|1
"This was a great movie. It had one ""sot-so-nice"" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot."|1
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test.|1
Something of a disappointment . Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York . His father was a longshoreman . His mother worked at an auto parts factory . I suppose it's not really that surprising to hear about a poor man working for a rich man . I wish he'd stay home and help his family . And I hope the company is a little more creative . Maybe a little more creative would go a long way . But, as we've all heard, the real problem is unionization. I've always been opposed to unions.|0
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in the first place (the latter, by definition, being old-fashioned). So for me it's just another case of a movie that was made by a company with no clue how to market a new product:

""It was a mistake, but not a mistake for the film industry, we should have known this was a commercial disaster. It seems to me that the studios and producers who made this movie should have paid closer attention when they went about making it."|0
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV . I only wish I could get to sit in the theater seeing this on a big screen at a theatre with a sound track. The first time I saw it, I was very young. It is not that the movie itself is so dark, it is that the movie itself has so much darkness in it. It has many scenes of blood and evil. There are some scenes that are so dark that you will never forget it . This was a film that should have been left alone.|0
There's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by Bruce Ramsay) are terrorised by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick.|1
"This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. Isn't there something a little hypocritical there? The scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite."|1
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it . I heard an interesting story about this film that I think everyone should know . In the end , this was the only film that really made me really care about the people who were killed . It was so heartbreaking and so tragic and yet there was also an uplifting message in the end . This is not only a message that people should be made aware of but also a way of telling our own stories , a message that should be more often seen and understood .|0
Formulaic to the max . Neither title reflects the serial 's actual content , `` Fighting Nazis in Morocco , `` nor was it at all a work that the author had intended to use as a novel. That is because, although it appeared as such, the text was in fact written by the German Nazi propaganda organization, the Abwehr , in response to an attempt to gather information about the movement from the Moroccan government . The novel was not, however, an official Abwehr publication , since it had not been published as such by the agency itself .|0
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out . They showed clips every time they did a trailer and it never really clicked . I think they should make it a little more interesting to watch it . I mean it’s great that they are coming with a feature where you can just pick the story and you can play it back or it’s just a fun feature to have but if they did a feature where people could watch the trailer and then watch the movie they would watch it more and it would make the movie better .|0
"By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive ""music"" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big ""surprises"" (which actually tend to be about as ""revelatory"" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience."|1
Dreadful . I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this . I’m still recovering from it . I hope you don’t try and read this . I wish you the best with it and it’s still a lot of fun and a lot of work to go over it . I’d like to get back to it again but I’d be afraid it might make me want to do this again and take a chance . I am a Christian and I still have my fears about hell but I do have a little hope .|0
Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isn't too much to complain about.|1
I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off.|1
"After being off the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s. ""Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health"" used the then (and I guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, George Hamilton (in a nice bit of casting)."|1
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers.|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating , the pace in the movie was so fast , a bit slow , a bit slow and then I realized that I’m going to see this film , and I don’t know , this film is amazing ! I’ll probably see this film over and over again . In the movie , the movie stars a lot of people who are not familiar with the characters , or at least they aren’t as familiar with the characters as the audience.|0
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys.|1
"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species."|1
Superhero Movie ( 2008 ) is the most recent in the long line over `` parody '' movie movies which has been made here and abroad. It is being released in all over the country, and I am hoping this is the last one in which I shall be writing about the movie. I will try to give a bit more information about the movie but if the movie has been made in any other language, please feel free to let me know by leaving a comment or message in my website. The plot is simple: An American girl named Natalie is living in Europe.|0
"I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the ""McHales Navy"" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too."|1
Wow -- this movie was really bad! You talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie.|1
"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on ""Mystery Science Theater"" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the ""MST"" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that ""The Girl in Lover's Lane"" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1.The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting."|1
You know sometimes you just got ta have it ? That 's how this movie is with me . I mean you know you have to make it work . I didn 't want it to just just be this one shot . I wanted this to be the first and last . That's why I didn 't really think that it would work , but I just know that it will because that's the way I feel about this , so you know I 'll be here . So you know I 'm gonna take a little break , so I'm gonna be here and see where the next one is .|0
This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one . `` THE HOLLOW '' is a great Hercule Poirot mystery that you would like to see more movies with. There is a mystery and then you have to figure it out. I think Poirot had it figured out by the end but I can't think of a better way to let him loose than by playing him as a man with a great mystery in his soul. I love watching this movie because it is well written, acted, directed by a great director. The story is great in a way.|0
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a dangerous journey across the ocean to Palestine. On December 8, 1935, the year before Kristallnacht, a young Jewish American college student sets off across the Pacific Ocean for Palestine with dreams of finding a woman who escaped Nazi persecution while traveling across the ocean. When he arrives in Palestine, the only person he could find in his search for the woman was an elderly woman with a reputation for helping other escapees, but he can’t bring himself to approach her.|0
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying something. I saw it in theatres in 1975, I saw it in a cinema the same day and it’s probably the best film I’ve seen to date about the horror of war and also the power of the government and the media to convince the public that what the Vietnamese were doing in Vietnam was all bad. It is a very disturbing film and you can see the horrors being carried out in the way they tell it in the film.|0
"When I first saw this show i thought to my self "" What is this!!!!!?"" Its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered ""huge"". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and well her family. Shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!)"|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually do n't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids. I was not in the mood. But I still went, and as usual it wasn't a great movie. I didn't find any redeeming value to the movie or the film itself. The ending was just awful and just about everything else in this movie was mediocre. I mean, really mediocre. I'm not talking about the acting or even the writing, I'm talking about the plot and how it's going to be handled.|0
River's Edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters.|1
"What I hoped for (or even expected) was the well known ""stop motion"" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. In short: The art of a) finding interesting Visual Events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. The stuff that made the other Qatsi's hits.I just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.Having watched the movie I got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping."|1
"Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. Some have merely called the film ""contemplative"", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a Realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on."|1
"After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of ""Belphégor"" before."|1
"This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ' and 'Garden State ' not because of content but because of the art style, the atmosphere and the overall ambience. The movie is based on the book of the same name but the movie has different characters. There is a scene in which someone says the line 'It is too late', which is the final line of the original book of the same name and then the scene changes into something else and the person says ""it is too late"" again. Then the person says ""It is not too late, there is no time""."|0
I 'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere , given enough time maybe the whole film would come to life! I can't help but think it was the first time we had seen a Yawn-fest where we had so much time on our hands we just had to turn up and see what was going on. We couldn't believe we were here, and I think all of us were a little queasy that we were all watching a film that had been so carefully crafted to make one of our favourites.|0
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.|1
This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title role in the first-ever Spanish language version, with an all Spanish cast including:José María Martínez-Sáenz, Miguel Ángel Monegal, Josefina García, Diego Fernández, and Luis González-Reyes, among many others.The show premiered on August 3, 2009, and its last episode was broadcast in early November of the same year, before its finale on December 4. The series continued for a few seasons after its debut on the SciFi Channel.|0
Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments , but I have to disagree on a couple of things . First off , I have not been in your country since I was 15 , when I got sick and I thought I had typhoid . Now I have had a cold for 2 months , the fever has gone down and I have no chills or other symptoms of a flu , so I think this may be something that is going on here . Second off I have never been exposed to this virus . I have not gotten sick from it either .|0
"Imagine every stereotypical , overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1939. The Bronx, the Lower East Side, Coney Island are all in the frame. They’re full of the usual suspects: drug addicts, street-level hustlers and the likes of “the Big Cheese.”

In this era of overkill, that’s nothing new for New York, either. But there was a new character in the 1930s called the Big Cheese – a character so iconic in Brooklyn, he became an icon for the entire city."|0
One of the movies i just DID N'T want to see . I got it in the sneak-preview , but it didn't seem to have a lot of merit , so i decided to watch it on my own . The storyline was so convoluted that i didn't have a clue about how any of the characters were working together . I did see that the movie had a decent plot . i mean , it seemed like the only plot it had was the storyline . But that's not the problem . the problem was the characterizations .|0
Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD.|1
When I first saw this show i thought to my self `` What is this ! ! ! ! ! ? I have to see an episode of this series ! ! ?'' and to be honest it was just a waste of time. Well I wasn't so sure about this show. I've never been that into anime series. I watched a bit of some of the ones that I watched. I've seen most of the new anime. But this was just the first one that I watched, for me it didn't hold any interest.|0
"I am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their ""problems"" all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). ""Hack"" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good histories. I just love it!! I hope ""Hack"" will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change."|1
OK, so this is horror? I get horror - but I don't get horrific. Black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. It's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but I hope not. My question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. Well that's been done before too.|1
Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe. The music from award winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.|1
I don't know which was worse, the viewer's made dopes of, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. Am I to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed the child was a bit dark ? Am I to believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said, hmmm this child looks a bit dark ? Am I to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records, that Lisa Hartman had this wow look on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black !|1
"Also titled -- > The Magical Castle -- > This one is a stretch . Why bother ? Why create a new form of ""magic""? Well , I didn't. I just tried to get away with it. It was a mistake , I know, but there you go. :p

So in the beginning I just wanted to write about a place that I visit every once and a while . And that's about it. And then after a while, I really got the idea to create a whole story out of a place . So I went ahead and started it."|0
"TART is the worst movie I 've seen this year , and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the one about Michael Jackson's 'Trial by Jury' that I saw last year . The worst of the three was GIGLI, while the second one is about Michael Jackson's ""Trial"" that I saw before I went to see ""Trial."" I don't see why anyone is surprised at how awful this movie was. If you haven't seen it, then you should, if it's any comfort."|0
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', Poland could play the role it did in WWII, being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna.|1
Once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, Hollywood pictures. Fast Forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. Now a hasbeen, Miss Lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(? ), Joan Crawford, and Bette Davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable Horror. But Flesh Feast? Really?|1
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in . The movie had no real substance at all to it. I can only assume that they took a quick look at the screenplay and realized they needed to get Pacino involved in the story and give him some kind of dramatic moment in the movie so that his acting career could come to the forefront at the time. In fact that was probably the only thing that was in the script that Pacino really loved. So that is what the director did with the film.|0
I 'd heard about this movie , but did n't see it until my daughter , who saw it on the movie theater , said it was the best one she had seen , and i liked the ending . I 'm going to get it , I 'll watch it tonight after dinner . I 'm not going to watch it before bed , that is if my daughter and i dont get caught up , lol . I 'm so sick and tired of people complaining about the movie and how it is not the best one they have seen.|0
"The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover , but we 've discovered it was a picture she was using for a movie she was in. Sandra Bullock is Sandra Bullock. The picture is from the video for the song ""The Man I Love"" from her movie ""Anchors Away"" which you can watch by clicking here . And here are our favorite Sandra Bullock Moments from the DVD:

- She says ""you know you should do a song with your new husband, you know what you gotta do for him to be so excited about your new guy."""|0
Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all.T hey (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead! He better be put on a lead and stay there!|1
i was a huge fan of this series . Yesterday i watched it again on DVD . I was apprehensive at first as i was told by my friend that i should wait till its out on Blu ray then it will be ok . But after a while i got to watch it and really liked it. I loved the story , music , action and the comedy . It was so different from what ever other anime i have seen . It is also very much worth watching and is a good entertainment . And i got to say this is the most interesting anime series i have ever watched .|0
"I just realized why the colors and sets in ""Sakuran"" were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn't call it acting."|1
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so forth. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic.|1
I 'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair , but the female villain in this movie had her hair pulled up to her neck so you couldn't see half of her. It's really weird. And I like her character, she looks like she could kick butt, and she can kick butt in her hair. Yeah, it was definitely a movie. I'd say it was just the right length and whatnot, but I'll have to see it again to really get an opinion about it.|0
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there.I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles.|1
This really is by far the worst movie I 've ever seen in my whole life ( I 'm approaching 35). It's too long, there are just too many plot holes for a single viewer to have any sort of rational basis for any of it. I've seen worse, most of it, but this really isn't up to the same level. I'm going to have to find another movie to watch. I agree, the most annoying thing about this movie is that there's not a whole lot to the story line.|0
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids . Spanky and the gang have their own party to go to . Then, he gets upset that he can’t do what they want and he has to go to the party to get it all done . . The movie was pretty good , but it was really hard to sit through it all. There is so much plot, but I never felt like it was all connected to each other. That is why I would recommend for you to watch it as soon as possible so you get a good idea of what happens.|0
I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.I don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'.|1
"I watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to some light reading ""Lobotomy for Beginners"".It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century."|1
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone X File that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to.|1
If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline.|1
OK , I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but I did see the movie , so I know all that is important.I saw this film on Friday . I saw it because I was at a midnight movie with my friends and I sat through it because it was a really good movie. What I saw was really cool, but there are not a lot of reviews of the film yet. I think this is the best it is going to get. I had never seen the movie and when I saw it , i thought , that this movie was awesome.|0
"Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad!Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of ""Reefer Madness"" going insane for no reason.Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there."|1
"`` A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being . His goal: the perfect genetic structure, or ""perfect man"" that no one has ever seen. And as the story begins, he's just one man on the way to creating such a perfect man. His DNA is being processed by a robot. Meanwhile, a scientist who has been working alongside his research has gone missing. Somewhere in this seemingly idyllic scenario, there's a problem. The robot has been programmed to replicate a man's DNA but has not been programmed to make the man."|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli . This movie is great because it was done right. It was made with a sense of fun and it has a lot of fun characters and comedy. It’ll make you laugh and make you enjoy yourself. I was a huge Jeff spicoli fan and I think that this movie will do the same for you. It’d be awesome for all ages. The movie has it’s humor in the early part. It goes from that to comedy and then it becomes serious again in the middle.|0
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film , but with Today I'm going to focus on the film as a whole and not a single specific scene. Since I'm writing this review in my own words I felt it would be useful if I did the same thing for today's film, so I'm doing it with spoilers for those who want to skip today. With a title like this, you can bet that the film will get one hell of a response, even if you don't want to waste your time with it.|0
This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig having been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. However, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided.|1
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there.|1
This movie was bad on so many levels . The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not deliver . The story line was weak . The characters were not realistic . The acting was so bad that even I forgot some of them were actors .The storyline was so weak that it was boring and did not have any impact on the storyline . The story was so dull that it ruined the entire movie .The movie had so many problems that I cannot even describe what it was . There was too many flaws that made the movie to be an awful movie .|0
"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(..in a running gag, anytime he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment."|1
My mom and I, rented this movie. I mean, we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they be big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks.But oh, we were fooled!! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small city in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. My mom and I believe in god and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. All I really have to say, is that we are Christian, but even we like to have fun.|1
"This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. After the introduction where we are given the backstory of ""something"" killing a couple people in a farm house, We are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - AND NOTHING HAPPENS for a looooong time. Then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for a very long time. Then FINALLY the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. Then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends."|1
Badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners.David is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an IQ below sea level.|1
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen . Although not directed by a famous director it does the job . It gives a fair impression of the police work as I had seen it on television . It does not gloss over it as some of the earlier films have done . There are a few slight errors that do affect the overall picture . Some of the errors are minor while some make the movie look rather amateur . Overall it is a very interesting film which does not look like it was made by a film-maker who is looking to please the audience .|0
"This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. Wanna know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead ""actress"" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted."|1
"I'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. The series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It is sad that a lot of the ""usual"" characters died but, damn, we had a lot of nice NEW characters.Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series, the plot."|1
Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue.Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.The plot rambles on.|1
I do not find this show at all funny . I actually think it is much worse than any of the others. It's more of a soap opera , than an animated cartoon . I think this show may have been more entertaining when it was in full cartoon form, not as it is currently , and it just does not make sense now . The only reason I did like the first few episodes is that I thought that the animation was excellent (as it was in all of the previous shows) and the music was wonderful .|0
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film . One Life Stand is a stark drama that through the power of its film language, delivers an extraordinary and powerful message to young people. The film, in a word, mesmerized me. It is so engrossing and powerful it will not leave you indifferent to the main characters and the message of the film. It’s a must watch for any film lover who has a love and passion for words. In my opinion this is one of the best documentary films that I have seen in years.|0
I saw this movie on TV and loved it ! I am a real disaster film fan , and this one is in my Top 5 films! I saw it about 5 times and i got it for free from my sister and I love it. You can also watch it on Netflix! This film was so good . It was not just one or two things , it had many themes and it gave you a good story! A great film . I really enjoyed it and the movie is really funny. This movie was really good . I would recommend anyone to watch it!|0
Set in Hungary in November 1956 , this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to escape from Nazi-occupied Budapest. It is set before World War II (1940-1945), the Cold War and the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. It features the escape of a Hungarian Jewish doctor, a young German man, and a young Swiss woman, who all try to escape from Nazi-occupied Budapest. The book also covers the experiences of the young German man's father, an elderly Jewish family, the escape of two Hungarian gypsies, and the experiences of a Hungarian Jewish refugee in London in the mid-1970s.|0
I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well. I will however give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti japanese propoganda. The japanese are portrayed as incredably evil b**tards who have respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense.|1
Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue.|1
This film has its detractors , and Courtney 's fey dresser may offend some folks ( who , frankly , don't know what Courtney is talking about ) But it's still a good flick , one that you have to sit through , in order to really appreciate what it was all about . There's alot about this movie that makes no sense, but the ending does , and makes sense, to me . And as for all that other crap , it isn't worth much anyway. It's really a fun little flick , you'll enjoy it , and there's really nothing to get too mad about.|0
Hehehe . This was one of the best funny road movies ever ! I laughed so I fell out of my seat and fell on the ground. The movie is absolutely worth watching. This film was made from the beginning to the end of the 1980s. This is one of those films that should be available on DVD. I don't have any problems with the plot, though. It's not one of those movies that you have to be bored out of your mind watching, but I would have liked it to be a lot more coherent and well made.|0
Thank God I have fast-forward . I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls . It’s not about the life of a young, idealistic boy. But, I can’t help but wonder what it might be like for his friends, family and the people with whom he grew up. I’ve always thought that the world was a bit unfair, but now I understand it a bit. That is, it was not intended that everyone would be ‘kind’ to one another, no matter how much they deserved it.|0
This was a modern TV classic ! The story goes like this , Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia . When he tries to get her , she leaves him and she does not tell anyone about their relationship . She says that she is going to a club . But the guy who works there says that she did not go to a club and she was not alone ! The guy then tells Bob that he has to find the person that she was talking about and he will do it if he can find her . Bob comes to his boss , and tell him that she is missing and he has to find her .|0
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his directing style is usually non-existent.|1
`` Out to Sea '' is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau . The story follows a couple (Lemoine and Matthau) and their kids who are on vacation in Hawaii, but end up in some pretty big trouble! In the movie, it's a couple who get into a big boat and head into the big ocean. While out there, they get into a bit of trouble and they end up being caught. This is a fun movie and I highly recommend you check it out.|0
"Very poor script and acting . I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with just a handful of actors . This movie was a huge disappointment. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful. ! Great movie

""Amazing performance by all the actors."" This is a movie that should be seen by anybody who loves to see a well written movie. The story is a good one, and the acting is very good. If you are a horror fan, this movie is worth seeing. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful."|0
"The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the life long friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the Stooges multi decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays ""Curly"" Howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved Stooge."|1
"Of course I am going to think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also. I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. The Director said ""It is taking to long, what would you do Gower."""|1
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends . Its reputation had preceded it to the big screen and I hadnt seen any of the actual scenes, so when we heard the title I was intrigued. After watching the story I thought it might be a film I would like to see again. So I watched it a few days later. I think I liked it! It was very well written with a very good plot. The film starts with a couple in love and then goes on to tell you about their relationship and marriage.|0
"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program."|1
I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another `` Biblical '' film again , if Noah 's Ark is ever made available for the average person , it would be the ultimate disaster. As I've mentioned before I've read quite a lot about how movies make money in the movies business. The way it works in the old days is that the studios bought out the rights to the story for a given period of time to the producers. That's why most of the time you hear about a film like the Bible having a big box office hit.|0
Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising.Once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As would be obvious, they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings.|1
This is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.Later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head.|1
Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can't recommend this film.The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort.|1
While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests.|1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this ? There 's a bunch of apes wandering around, but you don't notice them at all. You have to zoom in to pick out their faces. Then zoom out again to zoom in further, and zoom out even further, to get some kind of picture of them. And you're only allowed to zoom out as much as a pixel. I mean, they're so big, and there are so many of them! But they're still not that big and all of a sudden you don't notice the apes anymore.|0
I would n't recommend this to anyone , except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film , not with their faces. I dont know any of the writers , but i like to know what is happening. I never liked this film , but if you have to see a comedy , this is good . I dont know what a good film it is . The story is interesting but you just get confused , and forget about the jokes. The main problem is it was a remake of a movie, with the same actors . I like that this film has some funny parts .|0
This movie strayed too far from Straub 's novel for me to enjoy . Barely made it to the middle of its first hour. It was very predictable and not as entertaining as I might have hoped. If I had to choose one of Straub 's books to watch at the beginning of the film, I'd choose 'The Secret History of the Titanic' , because that's really the point of it all and it would have been the perfect start to the story. So sorry to say that. In conclusion, I'm sorry for the low rating - it wasn't meant to be and it wasn't enjoyable.|0
When I stepped into the theater , I thought this was going to be a great movie . And I thought it would have an amazing storyline . I was wrong . When I got home , I realized that this was the second worst movie I have ever seen ! And the best part is , it was my fault. If I had known , I would have made a movie about this. If I could do it again , I would do a lot better. There were a lot of very good aspects to this movie . There is a lot of heart in this movie.|0
Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play . A murder has been committed and a bunch of people from various backgrounds come together to find a body and to find out who did it . The show is based on a play in which a bunch of actors came together to come up with ideas and a few scenes for the show . The show has to be set in London in the mid 1980's . It has to be very realistic so that no one will find it to be a spoof . The concept is to get people to the scene where the murder has happened to find the killer .|0
"This film is all right, fairly silly and to be taken lightly. But what I can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment near the end: ""look, they all look the same"". Isn't that by far passing the good taste standards? I thought it was revolting, as were the heroic, unselfish acts by some of the people in this film. I'm not saying it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn."|1
Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love.|1
I watched this movie with big expectations . The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be quite the roller coaster ride . After the first 15 or so minutes I didn't care whether or not it worked as I've seen the trailers for it all before . I was still a little worried . After about the second 30 minutes of the first part I knew that the plot was getting a little far fetched and the ending was going to leave many people scratching their heads wondering what happened . I can see what the author meant when he said that the ending was meant to be confusing .|0
"This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.She is far better here than she was in ""The Out of Towners"". The material, I will admit, is beneath the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.As long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do."|1
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one that really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing.|1
That 's how I was when I walked ( staggered ) out of this `` film '' . I could have sworn I was in control . . . I didn't know it . . . I only knew . . . . I was in no way in control . . . . And now I am in control of . . . . . And I can say I'm the one who started it all . . . . . All of this is about me . . . . . I'm the one who has gone on . . . And that makes the difference .|0
"This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. I did actually read Gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. That angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. Above all this movie just leaves me asking ""WHY?"" Why do we see, as someone else aptly put, ""The Real World: Tudor England""?"|1
Very good film. Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.|1
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.|1
"Cheezy ? Yep . Poorly filmed ? You betcha . Zero budget ? They proudly claim it on their posters . I hope I can do the same . I've seen a lot of commercials and films on this very site . You think you know what you are about ? Not much to go on . A few of the characters are clearly not from this area , but I can't help thinking the guy who wrote this ad was hired by a local cable TV company , who has no idea . ""I've got it right here"" said the man at the front desk ."|0
"I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those ""make you squirm"" buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a disspointment."|1
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy , just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this movie had a heart of gold . It’s about the first love of the world and it shows you the type of relationship a person will go through when they finally find someone and get married. I’ll be honest that I was a bit skeptical of this movie but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this one. It’s the type of movie that people will actually want to watch with their wife because of the romantic story it shares.|0
"I saw this title again on Shemaroo . I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same movie for the first time and tell me how he liked it. The movie is ""Saving Private Ryan"". He told me what he thought. I have never seen this movie so I am not sure if that counts as a first time, but I am sure glad he said so. It was worth the viewing for sure. This was definitely the movie that put me in the right mindset to learn how to drive and I will always be grateful that I got my first lesson."|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) and I found I had a lot to learn. It did not seem to have anything new , it was just the same old story line of a beautiful young woman who wants a new car , with nothing to lose. However , I did find something that I had to say. There are two things that make me want to watch more movies . First of all , they are two of the best things to ever happen to me .|0
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales. I feel sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison, and so no more were made. It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. Still, it does at least make Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what doesn't?|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end . The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on a subject matter they might have seen in movies. This is what the average teen would write if they saw a movie they liked. In fact, it is almost too much. So, it has to be something we don't understand, or we would not be writing it. These are the lines that should be in every script of a horror movie or a comedy, but they rarely make it in movies.|0
Pete 's Meteor . I seen this referred to as `` authentic '' and a `` gem . '' I have my doubts as to the veracity of any of these . I would be interested in hearing how people came to their conclusions . I have a question . What is the most popular version of the game? I haven't been able to track down any information on it . In terms of price, I'm not a major fan of the game . Some of my friends are . Not a huge fan . I have no intention of buying it .|0
"Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware ""cop-movie parody"", and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not!"|1
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent.|1
"I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon."|1
Okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . It 's difficult to take characters seriously in the first place . It takes some time before I start to warm to them . But what it does start to pick up from the start is that these characters are not very interesting characters . There is nothing new about them . You already knew them and their background . They are just plain annoying . They are not the main characters and not really interesting . They can 't even get through the first act . They are just irritating .|0
Based on a fairly bland `` best seller , '' this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played a lot like a big budget B-level action/thriller for the majority of its run. The plot itself is actually fairly light, with little to no dialogue. However, if you want the full movie, then it may well be worth picking up. I found it to be very boring, which isn't a surprise as you would think it is a Lifetime movie, and that it would be a little more interesting and watchable.|0
"Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in ""Save The Tiger"" is Oscar-worthy, I feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.This is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member."|1
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it.|1
"For a really wonderful movie , you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good choice for this holiday season, don't you think? Here's why:

The film is a lovely story of faith in the goodness of humanity, and the goodness of Jesus Christ. If the story was based on a true incident, it would be the story of a young man who made a mistake that caused great pain and loss to his family. And it would probably be the most human and compassionate film of the year, because of how it portrays Jesus' compassion towards the poor."|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film, so I can't really describe how great it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. Then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. YOU JUST CAN'T miss. I mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This film comes on. You watch it and are shocked. It is so brilliant, so original it is so GREAT.|1
I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as much as I did. The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. What made this movie for me was the music. If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. Its all about being a rockstar. Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.|1
"The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  ""why""? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation."|1
"Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end . Although there are some , but I think the film is a little weak in places . The film is just not enough for me . I think it's not worth to buy or rent . There are some good songs . The film needs a bit of direction to make more sense . There is really something for everyone . This is for all fans of films like "" The Godfather "" , "" King's Speech "". It should be in the collection of fans . I recommend this movie !"|0
I 'm sorry but I just honestly can not see why anyone would actually like this . It 's stereotypical of this country to do this sort of thing. It 's supposed to be for people that can 't get out of a bad relationship and get out of a bad place, not for those of us that 're already out of a relationship. I 'd love to see this movie and get it on the big screen. But I 'm pretty sure it would not have the same response as it would have when it 's released. It 's hard to see the point.|0
I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot.|1
This movie is not just good , its amazing . Besides providing us with good performances , original plot , storyline and original theme this is a real masterpiece . The film is well written , the director of this movie was also good . I have a problem with this movie , it's not even close to what they had in mind , so i'm wondering if it is worth to watch . My friend has never watched this movie , but he told me the plot to it and it's pretty interesting. The story is pretty interesting. I'm just wondering how much this movie is worth ?|0
"""Hey, I didn't order no cab!"" ""Yeah, well you got one..."" What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America's TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode."|1
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. It was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp.|1
You know , I really hate IMDb 's censor system , since my entire review is almost gone if you don't agree with their decision. I don't know why these people are saying this, but IMDb just censor the content that they don't agree with. I'm sorry if i offended them, but it really doesn't bother me , because they make money, and I can't give them anything to give up their money . This is an amazing movie! I was going through the IMDb listings, and the last movie I saw was this one, and I saw it again about a year ago!|0
"Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of for killing his pregnant girlfriend

A high-budget murder mystery movie is being produced in Hollywood by a small team of young writers/actors in the hope that it will help them make it to the big time. The project is called “Grave of the Fireflies” and it was created by a small team of talented writers, directors, and producers with very specific ambitions for the film. This blog will cover the project and the film itself."|0
"(The beginning might be a spoiler...)""The Eye 2"" is the sequel to ""The Eye"". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. ""The Eye"" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas ""The Eye 2"" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit watching this."|1
One of the worst films I have ever seen! After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! This movie isn't scary at all! There is even no Typical horror clichés,too. The plot and acting of This movie was terrible.|1
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. Streisand wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, Streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts.|1
This movie is simply bad. First of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. It leaves you with questions when you're finished. Sometimes that's OK, but not in this case.The acting is nothing to write home about. The adults does a OK job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was worst. Well, to be honest I'm not sure that was the lead role. Never quite figured who this movie was about.|1
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I 've ever experienced with a film . The acting is so weak that it was almost like the film was directed by a child . I could just about see what the characters were thinking , and they were really just walking the line of the story . I was hoping that there was a story going on, but it was very boring . I was also hoping that the film was going to be more of a mystery than what it was , but I think that this film is more about how people treat each other than anything else .|0
"While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. A few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: ""I ate a rabbit."" ""I TOLD you she was possessed!"" ""Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?! ""There are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.The story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the Priest)."|1
I really tried to like `` Saw . '' The story was good , and I admire the breakneck pace it set the pace with . But it had some serious flaws . Not that I didn't enjoy watching it . I will admit . It was more a matter of the pacing being too fast , too slow , or the story being too repetitive . It wasn't all that good . Still , it was interesting , and made me think , what if . . ? I found myself wanting to finish this series , as it kept on getting better .|0
"I've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled onto ""Cidade de Deus / City of God"". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER than ""City of God"".The acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of São Paulo.I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.Something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on."|1
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.|1
"This was pretty bad - from bad acting , bad technical details , bad camera shots , and bad audio , it's not worth it

Sebastian - 07.11.2018

I just love everything about this film... I had a great time filming it. I had fun with the script.... I really think it's a great film and will watch it again. I loved the soundtrack, and the way the cinematography worked with it... it just made me go ""Oh yeah... this is what we wanted to do and it's good to hear it again""."|0
"I never fell asleep during a movie . Never . This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of this film , it should be mentioned that if you don’t want to see any violence or nudity it is best to turn it off as there is a scene where a woman takes a shower . All I can say is “How the hell can you watch this?”

And it’s probably a good time to be thinking . “What would I do?” And . . . what would you do? You can’t be all things to all people."|0
One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the scenes...Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow.|1
Not good . Mostly because you do n't give a damn about what happens to all these people . Some will get sick and some will be hurt by all of this . . . you can't expect people to be fair and honest when they're not even listening to you . . You might as well give it up . . . the government is trying to put you out of business . . . I don't care what happens to me . but if you can't deal with my problems, then what the hell are you good for?|0
The positives : It 's shot pretty well . Has some interesting peripheral characters . Likable main character ( albeit at times a bit stiff ) . A very entertaining film . But the negatives : The main female character is quite stiff in most of her interactions, especially towards the beginning . I felt like I was reading a novel . At one point I felt like she wasn't as good as the male characters , but the male characters are quite amusing . The negatives : The script doesn't do the book justice . But I think that it is pretty well written and the movie has a lot of potential .|0
There seems to have been some money behind this film , but it would be impossible to imagine a film like this coming out this year . the picture has a great story , great acting , and good direction . the plot is well thought out and has a good balance between action and drama . the ending is well done . it is very hard for an action film to pull off the action and still have a good story , but in this case there is really no question about which direction you should go in . the story , like most of this kind , revolves around two brothers .|0
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all of the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script.|1
I honestly do n't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review , as a result, I hope it's an open discussion . That said, here's a brief synopsis on the story . The story is about a group of college students that are having a little bit of fun in an old school setting. The movie focuses on four of the students . They have a group of friends with them in this classic school setting . This group of friends form a band , and it's not just a bunch of freshmen .|0
A film , first and foremost , should be good storytelling . It should be entertaining - and entertaining does not necessarily require being good - but it should make you smile or laugh or giggle or cringe or cry or want to throw things and/or hug or do whatever else you can in order to achieve the effect of “this is an amusing film, please go on” . But you also want to enjoy the experience. If you have seen the movie in the first place, and are enjoying it , that should be sufficient .|0
Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The story-crap The acting- crap(Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The plot-crap The subplot-garbage The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junkI have vowed to watch Romy and Michelle's High School reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes.|1
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the dough, not only for writing this book and all of the other books we've done, but because they're bringing out all the other authors at conferences. You're lucky, you've got Jane. This year we have three new authors. They've all been very nice and helpful to me. And it's a pleasure to announce that Jane Turner has joined me here with her beautiful new book about the American Civil War, the War of Northern Aggression.|0
"OK, Number one-this ""film"" is a ""90's"" version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers! Number two-As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I walked in halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but It's just not believable to me that little skinny Omar Epps can chase down a big grown man, without a gun, and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous ""plot""."|1
Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Following a few random prisoner deaths, Rackham takes in Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Luckily for everyone, Barbara Bach just happens to be on the island too! Unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.This Italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a dash of WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff.|1
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" "" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" "" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO ."|1
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced, frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. I'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King.|1
"I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick , and I 've always been a sucker for the idea of the ""bad man"" who has his way with a little girl , who he wants to be his plaything. Well the movie does not quite work on that premise , it does work on one , and I'm pretty damn sure the other one doesn't work for me, although I think the movie may work for others , I just couldn't see this one as a winner for me."|0
"Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oPThis movie is ""D"" quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997."|1
Good old Jess Franco ! The always-reliable choice of director in case you 're looking for undemanding sleaze , shamelessly raunchy vulgarity and some of the most unmitigated perversion on the planet . But now, you can see exactly where he gets the material . The film will be a remake of the 1960s television series 'Bachelor Party', which starred his son, Ben Franco . Ben , of course , is Jess's ex-wife and one of his daughters. But Ben isn't actually involved with the film, nor is Ben's character in the film .|0
"I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are not any movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said ""stupid"". I applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one."|1
We get to see who the good guys are . The union . And who the bad guys are , too. We also get to see who is doing the bad thing . And the good thing . And we get to see how we, the public , are reacting . This is how people feel about all this . We get to feel angry about what was done in our names . We get to feel worried about what might happen if this gets worse . We get to feel afraid . All this . And we get to feel like it's all our own fault .|0
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched . It makes Mel Gibson look decent in comparison

I watched this as soon as it was released and can’t stand it. There is not one damn redeeming aspect to it, not a single ounce of substance. I know it is not a bad movie but this just simply doesn’t deserve to be watched, let alone posted on these forums. Mel Gibson and his crew have always been a bad bunch, and it’s sick to watch them try and do things they know will end in disaster."|0
This is a crummy film , a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies . And a genre that could have its own movie of the future ( the one that never came about ) . But here we are again, and I can't stop thinking that we've been here before . There's a reason , a very very important one , why I never like this kind of movie . But it's not my fault , and I'm still not going to say this to any of your readers , but it's really a terrible movie .|0
An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him.|1
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination. The are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. It is a film of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. There are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit in. Both Kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them. Next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up, such as the Texas Gov.|1
This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's spooky. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won't go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius.|1
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies , and let me just tell you-it is not a good movie, and I will not even try to pretend that I have watched a good movie for a very long time. It is a dumb movie that should not be enjoyed by anyone, and probably will never be since it is full of stupidities. The movie opens with a scene showing that there were a number of famous athletes that were able to accomplish unbelievable things and come back and win the gold medal, including the late Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, Jim Brown, Roy Rogers and Babe Ruth.|0
I have read almost all the books by now , and have seen the musical production in two different languages, and I have a very strong conviction that they will be the same. I have to say I think this production is the best musical that has been produced in Israel in over 20 years. As this is Israel, I also have to say the audience was superb, I felt like I was at home, and the audience seemed very satisfied. It was an enjoyable evening for all ages and people of all backgrounds, I could not imagine a better evening to come home to.|0
Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There's the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. Unlike Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible.|1
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young, gifted girl. The story ended with a cliffhanger. I’m glad I read it but I’m worried that some readers may be offended or disturbed by the ending. If this story was to have such a bad ending would it be published? I would think that this type of story is a safe story to read. If an older man’s life is to end, the story should not be about death but instead be about what the man wants to do.|0
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired, it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted.|1
I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int ' l Film Festival . It is extremely absorbing and very informative . It is also an excellent way of making a film about the history of the film industry . The film is very well made and quite funny . The documentary shows the history behind the production of films, and the way in which the film industry developed . It is a documentary about how the American film industry reached its current state. The film was made on a budget of $6.7 million and was made with the cooperation of around 100 companies.|0
As far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries anyone? ), this one is up there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it aims for. In recent light of events (Guantanamo) this movie is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of it's time, when it was released in the 70s! One can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): Screw the politicians and politics in general.|1
So well done . The photography , sound , music and the performances were the best . It 's also a little hard for me to find the place for this show here in our country .I hope that if you are planning to see this show , you can go and book it at least for the performance . It 's a must go . I was at this show and I can say it was very good! The music was awesome, great costumes, the lighting, and the overall experience was a good one.|0
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old . I had half-day kindergarten and then we went to school for four years and then after school we stayed for three hours and then had dinner and then it was time to go. It's funny because I went to school because I wanted to go to a school because my friends were so much better. It's also funny because I love that show. It has all the songs, the songs that my mom wanted me to sing and my friends. They were very good singers.|0
I am partly a fan of Miyazaki 's work . I say `` partly '' because most of his films aren't entirely made up or inspired by manga . However, I was pleasantly surprised not only by Miyazaki , but also by his original work . I can't wait for more films from the legendary director to be released in the future . Miyazaki's work is definitely worth a watch . I recommend you go check it out now . I am going to write a bit more about Miyazaki and his films after this article . Let's start with a short interview with Miyazaki .|0
A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others . It 's a horse racing movie , and it 's about racing , but it 's better than nothing . !!! The story of the movie is more like a story . It doesn't have a plot , there's not much to say , and you have to read the subtitles . I recommend you to read the subtitles to find out the name of the horse . There are only about a half dozen horses that are used in the movie , and those are the only horses that have been shown in this film .|0
Based on what little i have seen of this show I don't think I will ever watch it again. Its not even remotely believable and frankly the Derek character just makes me angry.Sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again? Why would i want to watch that?!? No thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though.Not to mention that I think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings.|1
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house that it is based on as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. I know that, because I was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing.|1
"What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, I'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I've put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you've got all that great dialog like - ""Dave, look at the composition of this mud."""|1
Though I have watched Salò , I do not know if excrement tastes tart . If it does , this is what it tastes like . If it does not taste tart , it would be a good thing to eat if it is true , but I dont know of a way to prove it . I dont understand how anyone can believe that excrement tastes tart if it tastes sweet . You see, excrement tastes sour because there is sour juice in it . When that juice is converted into sweet taste, it tastes sweet to a human .|0
Korine 's established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive image-maker . The promotional posters for Mister Peepers were produced , along with its official soundtrack . The film was a box office success , grossing a total of $19.8 million in America . It also became the opening film of that year's Cannes Film Festival . In addition , Korine's other films were critically well received . Mister Peepers , his second feature , won a Directors Guild Award , while his third and final feature , , became a nominee for a Golden Bear . This was the year in which Korine was also introduced to American audiences .|0
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel , especially when it is so obvious that the story was told in a way that allowed Moses to be successful ,and that he could be victorious in conquering the whole of the Land of Israel . But I cannot help but wonder, if it was true, why did Moses get so many requests for the story of the Exodus? Why would any of the men in the army want to listen to the story of what happened on the day of the exodus?|0
"This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the ""gallant"" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha! )The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. And I liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well."|1
Ah! When good actors take on bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialog is just plain silly.But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will LOVE this movie!|1
There 's only one thing I 'm going to say about cat in the hat ... as a KIDS movie, this is going to be something a lot of kids/parents/families/parents of other animals are going to get. And that 's the fact that we 're really going to see cats and dogs and wolves in a movie. The only thing is that I can' t tell if it will be in a big budget film or not. It probably will be in a 3rd part feature film or something, and it 's possible it may go into a franchise.|0
This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos . It 's done really well in this aspect and it 's very good to the eyes. If you are into this kind of things then you may find it interesting as this is not a common thing to see in films . Now let us go on to see this movie . Alfred Hitchcock's movie was released on 25th of February 1963 and it tells a story about an Englishman who comes back to America from a trip to London, where he meets some Americans who were also interested in making films in the English language.|0
"I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $ 5.50 , so I thought I would post here and say hi. Here is the cover and the DVD cover - if you look closely you can see that there is a watermark but I was too lazy to take a snapshot of the DVD cover so I have only posted a few pictures of my own DVD copy. Now that we know what to get, here are some things you need to know:

The first DVD in the set consists of three movies."|0
I grew up watching the `` Bowery Boys '' on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell there was something different about the guys who became famous for the way they acted and acted like it. The way they were acting was different from most of the guys I grew up with. One day, I watched the Bowery Boys as a child and I noticed that they acted like there were no women in their lives. They were so self conscious that it took them some time to realize that they were not alone in their actions.|0
Everything about this movie was bad , the acting was bad and the plot was bad . And were is the only good part . I really wanted to watch this movie . It was so boring ! I didn’t laugh at any point of this movie. It’s just me laughing, not at any characters and not at any situations. The dialogue was bad , the acting was poor and the jokes were horrible . It was just like watching a horrible cartoon . It is so annoying! I hate the film, it’s terrible!|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (Mahler's 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent fan of Bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in ""The Servant"" however). Note: I recommmend multiple viewings."|1

Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer ( supposedly in his first lead role in a feature ) and his crew. A young man is abducted by aliens and taken to an unknown, hostile planet. He meets two aliens, one of which he has sex with. He escapes from his captors. He finds himself in a strange world where he’s kidnapped again. They are not the aliens he expects and he knows they will not return him. So he begins to fight with them. But he finds that this fight is becoming more and more difficult.|0
Oh man , this movie was toe-cringing bad . Bad look , awful story ... the list of good things is almost endless and so are the reasons to hate this one. There was not one moment in the whole movie where the film made me laugh and it's not because any of the characters seemed to be funny but rather they were just awful to look at. It felt like there was no reason to even make the film at all. I was glad it was over though because it was just too awful to watch.|0
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it . it's not that he wants to be funny but he thinks this could be a real horror movie . here's some of his stuff . there's been a lot going on in the last few years and a lot of that is due to the rise in religious and occult beliefs . there's also the rise of the so-called alternative media and you have a lot of that in this film . i think there is a place for humor and there has to be a place for that .|0
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person . This movie made me want to kill my wife and my cat. I have been looking for a new movie on demand for a while now and this is one that caught my attention. This is not a comedy as you might expect but it is really well made. If you like movies this is a must see for everyone. I would love it if you enjoyed it, if not I am sorry but I won’t waste more time with your comments or messages.|0
I saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and I didn't know where it had come from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here at IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is great, I believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. And the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining.|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie . In fact , I have to agree with most of you who said this movie was rushed and that it is boring . There is not much depth in this movie and , for that reason , it makes it seem like it is lacking. It does not make up for it. I have to be honest and say that I do not have much to say in this movie , however I will do my best to tell you how it is .|0
I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a Mexican soap opera.Also the acting was terrible especially Charityn and her son. That's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. I'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means Dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.|1
I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years.|1
One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films , `` Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster '' turns up at the end, but unlike in the cartoon , this one is not just an extra in the finale of the movie. In the actual film, it actually shows you how the monster moves in the real world . The film shows you the actual path it takes to get from the film set to the Loch Ness Monster , all through the real world . That was a really exciting movie to watch, as it is the first one to actually show you how it is done in the real world .|0
Definition of documentary : A work , such as a film or television program , presenting political , social , cultural , religious , national , religious , or similar views in a non-official way, without official recognition of such views or of the author or creator as a person , or without the official recognition of the authority of a government or authority on behalf of all the people of his or her country .

"I 've been a fan of Larry King 's show for awhile , I think he does a terrific job of breaking the news in an interesting way, he makes the news look easy to understand. I am the kind of person that needs to find the news when I need it. I have tried to go to TV news when I have information, they don't do it for a reason. I prefer to be the first to hear a breaking news or breaking story. __________________""I have a problem."" ""I'm sick of being sick, so I need to get out of the house."""|0
"1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled ""Hairspray"" but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone."|1
Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months.|1
Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses . The other two I have had mixed reactions . So, I ask you all if you would like to take a moment to reflect on this movie and what it is about, and why you found it so compelling and so worth your time. And if you agree that this film deserves an award, I want you to make a comment and submit your nomination. I will be reviewing each and every single one of your responses. It is the only time we have to do this.|0
This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie.|1
mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary . in the world of wine there is a huge different between the way a bottle is presented when it comes off the shelf and how it's handled once it's opened...it's just the way it feels after the first sniff and the way it is received by the glass. I saw a lot of wine in the store today, and that was one of the things that really stood out - how the labels were displayed in the wine glass. You see the same thing on the store shelves in wine shops all over the world.|0
"I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me , and we both had the same goal, so that we could go to Hawaii and enjoy the island lifestyle. We both have family living on the Islands and we both want to do that again. The movie was so good, so it was a lot of fun , it was like watching a movie with my friends. It was just a fun movie to watch and not a big deal

The first time we went to Honolulu, we went from the mainland to the island."|0
"High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar over sexual misconduct allegations

An athlete, a coach, and a coach's wife were charged with sexual misconduct by former high school track star Tameka Harris, who lost her Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro. A community of athletes and coaches that grew up in Flint, Michigan called for justice after allegations that Harris and others had sexually assaulted female athletes surfaced online in the past few years. The allegations led to accusations of sexual misconduct in high schools across the nation, as well."|0
For the record , I hate spoof movies . Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE ! because those are classics . . . which is another reason I have not yet seen the new version of AIRPLANE . . . but I must admit I am still going to watch it on DVD . . . and I am NOT giving up on it . . . if I had to put up my two cents . . . I think it is a very entertaining film . . . . especially the end of the movie . . . I watched it last night and LOVED IT ! .|0
I 've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute classic. I had read that it was a remake of a film that was supposed to be made in the 80s, but that it never made it into production due to some budget issues. The original film is a brilliant piece of cinema and I would recommend that you have a look at it before they do another one. If you do, you will see how much work it takes to make such a classic, especially with such a short amount of time to make it happen.|0
Can't say this wasn't made well. At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. And there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is an oddly non-Hispanic film in the same way West Side Story was many years ago. Both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a sort of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself.|1
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV , but after seeing the trailer it was difficult to watch it on TV. While some of the performances are pretty good , most of the time it seems that the filmmakers didn't have much talent or know what to do with all the characters , I just couldn't care less about the characters . I'm sorry but I can't seem to care about any of the characters they have portrayed . They just try to show their personality on a daily basis and never take the time to develope any of it .|0

See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White. They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. But, watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind.|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics , and is a must see for all psychotronic fans . This movie was a very different approach than the original thriller it was based upon . The main difference was that the movie had very little special effects . The film was a bit darker and a lot more mysterious than the original thriller. The main difference between the two was in the ending of the movie . In the original thriller the main character was killed , but in the film version he didn't make it as the main character.|0
First of all , I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Smith as the founder of Mormonism and as a Mormon. I do not believe that it is a better work of fiction than others. I don’t believe that there is any way to judge a work of fiction by the work of a non fiction author. I think the work of the non fiction author should be judged by what it is they can do with it, and not by what is it that makes the work of fiction better than other things.|0
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram . What a come down from Fox values and standards ! This is the type of film that Fox should not make ! And it was a great movie ! But Fox wants Chan to make all his films just like the others that he has produced. They do not want to put him on a level that he is a big star now . They want to make his movies for him. Chan is too big now. It is hard for some to believe. But I believe that this movie is what it is.|0
A remake can be successful . An adaptation can be successful . It is n't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation of the story. If I am reading the story in question and the story does not concern itself with being a remake, then it makes no difference. If the question is how can an adaptation succeed, then it is a remake of the story not an adaptation of it. The original story is a remake that can be successful, and an adaptation can be successful, it depends on the adaptee.|0
This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected of them by their parents, but they just don’t get it. And they go on to destroy everything they touch, including the people they were supposed to be helping. This film is not as bad as some of these films, like The Blair Witch Project. But it still doesn’t hold a candle to all the other shit that has been done on this subject. If you are in search of an entertaining, low-budget horror film, this probably won’t be your best option.|0
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production . Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent of today's acting world. I'm sure you won't disagree with any of the main actors. It's certainly not a film you want to put down until you have seen it once, but rather a film for people that don't normally consider themselves actors, and are drawn to the style of movies like this one . What I really love about this movie is that it doesn't have any real substance to it. What you are seeing is mostly the actors acting as actors.|0
Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact, I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death.|1
For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 , but in general it's a 5. I am not fond of this film because it has all the makings to become one of the worst movies ever made. The film is slow and boring, but I don't like it for any of the reasons stated here. I would definitely recommend this one over most other indie films that are made this way and that's why I'm recommending this movie to the audience, because it just doesn't seem to do what it's made up to.|0
i don't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones. when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off, but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires, a combination that i thought could not fail. That is until i popped this into my DVD player.|1
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen . it is a tight slap in the face to a genre we all know and love but it does it so well and you feel like you are supposed to like it because you like slapstick and that’s fine , but this film is not for the faint of heart . There are moments here and there that will make you smile but there are other times that make you cringe as if you are watching a horror film , even though we all know it is not what we want it to be , but we can take it .|0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company.|1
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of, including several on the stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen! He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. The way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (as Hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life.|1
The director is sweet , as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen , but their movie sucks . It has an awesome premise and some really great acting . But they lack the creativity in the film . The screenplay is not very original, it's all based on facts, and it's nothing original. The director is not original , neither is Geffen . The best part about their movie is that all of them do a very good job in the film . If you like what they do in their movies , go and watch their movies , they are very good .|0
"The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief ( the Indian ) by an Winnipeg city officer ( the policeman ) who has a vendetta against him

The Chief and I were just having a conversation about some stuff, and we were getting to talking about it, about where we stood on all the major issues. So this is the conversation we’re having here. And I’m sure the chief was talking to me at that same moment, talking about some of the major issues, and he asked me this question about some of the major problems that were being put forward."|0
I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie, because she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There both really stupid and just terrible actors.|1
Okay , so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern times but the studio decided it would not work and he was never going to get the remake made. There is still a remake of Psycho coming out on DVD this summer that is based on Psycho 3 and I will post about that later. I’m also glad that this movie got such a good reception, it is well worth seeing. One of the more interesting things is that this is a sequel to Psycho and if you are not a fan I would recommend checking it out.|0
I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible! I expected it to be great, because you know, usually we don't have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off, you really don't have anything useful at all! The director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example.|1
Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.The music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and under-developed.|1
I generally LIKE Sion Sono 's work , but this movie was completely retarded . But sadly , not retarded for me , because I know how dumb this concept is . In short , Sion Sono makes a movie with a good idea . But , after 2 hours , he can't come up with a good enough idea to make any sort of good story . So , he decided to dumb it down even further . Like in the case of this film . I can't really tell you exactly why I like it . It's kind of a tossup .|0
"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.The cast is nice."|1
Sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A. Fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his cinematographer, László Kovács) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel.|1
"As an ex (nuclear) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the ""inside jokes"" from the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the ""Orlando"" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely ""DBF"" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the Admiral in charge here?"|1
I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I did n't stop to consider the quality of what I was going to get. My expectations were high for this one as it had become a regular fixture on my list and was a bit of a 'must-have'. But I was so taken by the design that I was reluctant to take any risks with my money, which I now regret. As soon as I started watching, I could see that something was going wrong. There are some things about this video which don't sit in line with my own personal taste.|0
I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc.|1
"A middle aged man , Robert Jordan , set in his ways , takes on a boy scout troop after the boy fails to do their chores . . . , and the rest of the troop are aghast. It's the kind of story that makes you just wonder why anyone would even try to live their lives. The first time I saw a movie with a character who wasn't quite a man-child, I thought ""I want to punch that person!"" I don't want to offend anyone - especially myself - by talking about how much I wish that were the case."|0
"""Love Life"" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene."|1
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing.|1
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. He also thinks he's a chicken.Sounds bizarre right? Well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on.The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck.|1

"Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen in my life. (I mean really, how many times does this happen? Oh, never. I'm just saying. You get the idea.) I am sure I am not alone in my opinion that this is a complete disaster and has nothing to recommend it to anyone who has never seen even the slightest of the ""good"" movies out there. So let me explain why:

1. The movie itself is completely awful."|0
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least . The basic plot is 3 old business associates reuniting at a lake house to find out what was really going on in the mysterious disappearance of 2 of them. The only person I can see in the story with any kind of interest is John F. Kennedy, and he is a great part of the narrative, but for the story itself it's all just weird. I'm sure I'm not the only one that enjoyed this film. If you like bizarre, strange and weird, you're going to love it.|0
(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction.|1
I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene.|1
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film.|1
Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face.|1
This film is really really bad , it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at horror , the only thing in it that is really good are the performances , especially in the third one , the third one should be rated higher , I am not saying that it has to be a classic , just that it deserves more recognition , I don't see a single thing here , I mean if you see something good in a movie you watch it , you watch it , and you are going to see that it is a horror movie , well that is it .|0
I just watched this movie last night . Within 30 minutes of the start , I was hoping it would get better than I was afraid it would. This film has some nice moments but they never really build up the tension to get me interested in it. The actors did a great job , but their characters are not very convincing . All I really want is for it to end so I can do something to help . This film will not be one of my favourite movies . I think I have seen everything this guy has ever done in this genre .|0
"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone)."|1
A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this. Honestly - just don't bother. A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic.

Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging.There is, however, a flaw.|1
"MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood . No major stars show up -- but it's a nice little surprise, and worth the time spent watching. Jimmy Durante and the Hootie and the Blowfish in Hollywood

From the moment the doors open, Durante and Hootie step out onto the carpet, you know it's going to be an entertaining evening. But the real action is to be found inside. Hollywood is full of celebrities and their entourages, all eager to get to the party, but not so much that it takes much time to figure out who's invited to which."|0
How do I describe the horrors?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot.Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's.|1
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time . Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least . Energy is essential in a comedy, not a tragedy, but he does not have any . This film is just like the ones you see on television, the ones with all the girls with blonde hair. That is why I liked it so much. And now I feel bad because the movie was not good at all , but because it was a horror film it did not deserve the attention it is getting . I am also very disappointed that there were not enough female roles in the film.|0
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting , they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. Will one side be overpowered , or will both sides win ? And how will a single person be able to decide who will win ? It is a question that haunts all the moviegoers. And now , we will show you the best ways to know how the movie-goers will resolve their doubts , and finally end the action in their movie-going day. There are many things that you will need to consider before you decide which villains will be the victors in your movie.|0
Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one : he 's co-screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish animated short. Allen has a keen grasp of science, and he brings that into the movie, as he has always been good at creating science fiction stories. The cartoon is a real treat for children, and Allen is a real character in this movie. Allen has done a few shorts for Cartoon Network before, including this one. The animation here is wonderful. The characters are a bit simplistic, but Allen has a knack for getting them to be believable.|0
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references . Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing . Noah and the Whale is a terrible movie. You're supposed to see it once in a while if you have the time to stop by the theater, and even then it's just a boring movie about Noah and his wife and kids who live in a sea of plastic and fish . It's a terrible film, the worst animated feature film of the last decade, and the worst film of 2016 . It should have never been made.|0
Somehow , I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and in mountain climbing, you know, it's a great thing, it's really good for the environment. When we first see the movie we're told that the plot of the film revolves around three main characters. We're not really told exactly who they are. They're the three main protagonists. At the beginning, we start out with a character who has gone through so many experiences, he really didn't know the meaning of life.|0
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything.|1
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the , very protracted , end ! The plot of this film was very predictable , as the characters were not in the real world , it is a remake , it's just too predictable to make sense . The only reason for this film is because they couldn't make one . I couldn't wait for the end of this film as the ending left a lot to be desired . This film is completely predictable , boring , uninspiring . And worst of all , it's full of idiots .|0
"I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire"". To begin, I'd say that ""Water"" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of ""heat"" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships."|1
"As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! As a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... ""Cely"" (my own last name).Originally titled ""Hostages"" this picture was changed to ""Another Son of Sam"" by the Producer-Director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time."|1
This Blake Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of Julie Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release.|1
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it , despite the lack of budget the film has so far received very positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. This review is not exhaustive, as I will be reviewing this movie again in a different form. I have always been an avid fan of independent films. Not that there is anything wrong with that, as I have loved watching movies on tape, on my computer and in DVD’s, but I do enjoy watching them as they were meant to be seen.|0
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV . I own all 9 seasons on DVD and it is one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV. It is the perfect comedy and is one of the most underrated sitcoms of all time . Even the writers and directors did not see that it was going to get this much success. The plot is just about as funny as the characters themselves. It was one of the greatest television comedies ever and I am not going to forget it. I will forever hold this show in my memory as the best.|0
Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.Presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. This sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. Don't go out of your way to see it.|1
Underwoods goofy story about a young man ( Arquette ) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra for the fun of it. However, Frank is very upset to be kidnapped and when they find out that he loves them, they let him go. This is in response to Sinatra's attempt to make them do something that they don't want to do. Arquette is not very bright and has no real talent. It is his own idea to kidnap Frank Sinatra, but he's not very intelligent and does not know how to use his own ideas to work out what he wants to do.|0
I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so.What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.Where to start? Okay..1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) No ricochet.|1
"Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic ""writing"" sure will.A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. Need I say more? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special."|1
"If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film ""Nemesis"", then you'll love this one. I loved it the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like ""Nemesis"" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them."|1
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. The acts is so awful nor the plot. The story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, you name it! 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so below average film.|1
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy , yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Haysbert . It is an unsettling film that explores issues of racism, class and sexuality in the South, while the film is also an examination of the nature of masculinity in the 1970's. The movie is also considered a cult classic, since it has become a cultural reference for black audiences in many parts of the country. The movie is one of my personal favorites and I’ll probably revisit it in the near future when I have some free time and the opportunity.|0
During filming , was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon ? It was like she was reading from an autocue . I think that’s very important, you’ve got to go with what you’re comfortable with , you can’t take it all in . And I’d seen her take the same look before in some of the other films and I really like that, it just gives a certain kind of energy to certain shots . Did you feel any kind of pressure to look as good as Vanessa Redgrave?|0
Have to agree that this movie and it 's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve . Here's my reasoning . The story itself does not appeal to me. It's just too predictable and dull. I did however find the director's direction interesting . It's a good use of silence that you can actually feel in a movie. Not to mention the cinematography. The camera work is beautiful and the soundscape is also very well done. It's not perfect in my opinion, but I found it a nice addition to the overall package .|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that?There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests."|1
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. Check out the minuscule crew credits on Camp Blood, there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in, its Brad and his buddies and thats it, no pretentious rubbish. Jennifer Ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts.|1
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame American monster flick needs affordable SFX.|1
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following , then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected and it could be considered a more polished, and better sequel. Unfortunately, the film was rushed to the deadline, with too few scenes completed, and with too much story crammed on the screen, to make an effective sequel. That’s probably because Memento wasn’t the sequel the Nolan needed to make. The filmmaker wanted to tell the story of a murder mystery that would play out through a character’s memory in real time as the memory of a crime is transferred to a new form.|0
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down . His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched . Earth was the last refuge of mankind. We were supposed to have a world to return to after the final battle. But now there’s no place left to return to. There were so many stories, so many hopes and possibilities, that it’s impossible to see the end of this war and the beginning of an entirely new one. And that’s why Roddenberry’s end came at the hands of an enemy that is beyond anything that we could ever have imagined.|0
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics, they released Irreversible and a range of Bergman's opus.The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's strangely titled film MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr Joe Average, replete with voices in the head, visions, and madness. It's set in rural redneck Australia, the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many Australian movies.|1
I 've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film . It seemed dull to me , much as I am with most Hollywood fare . It seemed like it had no life . It felt as if it had no substance . This was not a good movie for many reasons. My favorite scene , to me, was when Kevin is sitting in the hospital , he looks at the television, and sees an interview about him . That moment made me laugh . And I think that's what made the whole film that way. There was a disconnect with the viewer.|0
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on . It 's a dog movie that is basically a remake of another dog movie . The film is directed by Mike Mills who also directed the first two James Bond films . I didn't know that this was his second film . Now you have a film about a kennel and it's dogs in it . I have seen other movies about dogs in their homes and their lives but never about dogs in a kennel in a film. I was expecting something with a lot more violence .|0
Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut . Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry, so naturally, they're the two leading men for this film. However, they may be the lead stars, and the other two characters may not be so well-defined. That's not necessarily a problem with this film, however. It's a very well-acted, well-acted film. Every moment is well-explained. And it's got a great performance from its lead, Minnie Driver. Not to mention that the director and the actors, David and Minnie, have something that the other two characters may not.|0
"The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at ""My Maisonette"". Hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of ""alternative comedy""(I hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on TV today.I'm glad that on a trip of local DVD retailers today ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" was sold out across the board."|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies , I 've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint , Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson . The first time I see Emma Watson in an outfit that I think is perfect , her hair and eyes make me realize what I 've never really thought about her as a person before . This is because I love her . She is so feminine , yet so much more sexy in this outfit. She looks like a model , but her style makes you forget that it was only a model in real life .|0
Originally , the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial , and it shows . I dislike serials ; they can become tedious and have no real point. It's the same with this one, so I'm hoping it goes more smoothly. I'd also like to know what the story will involve in regards to The Spiders . It sounds a bit like it's about a new character who's in danger . What's his backstory? And who's going to be a part of this story? We've heard some about a new character on the show .|0
Move over Manos . Back off Boogens . It does n't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach isn't really as glamorous as it seems. As if that weren't enough, they're offering freebies to surfers, fishermen, joggers, beachcombers and bathers. In reality, Malibu is just a beach that happens to be popular. It isn't really the destination; it's simply the name for a small strip of beach on the northern tip of the island. It's got a lot of good waves but few people and lots of empty sand.|0
OK, I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I did see the movie, so I figured I would leave a comment on it. I just love once again how Joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. It seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities.|1
Do NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. It possibly is the worst movie I have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire.|1
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason.|1
I saw this film in the movie theater . I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course, the film was a must see and I saw it a few years back in the theaters . There is one scene at the end where the director talks about how the audience got the feeling that it was his own life that we were watching and the film did a very good job . So, this was a good film and i saw it several times when i was younger . It was nice seeing it again and it gave me a better insight to how it all was done .|0
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild , but I do remember thinking that I was going to enjoy this movie at some point. The film was directed by Joe Letteri and written and directed by Frank Miller . There are two other Spider-man characters that I really liked as well, but in hindsight I don't feel that they were quite as important as Peter Parker himself. Peter Parker is an ordinary, average teenage boy living in a typical high school. Peter Parker has his life pretty much as normal as he can reasonably expect it.|0
Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it.|1
Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism to the core. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic.|1
It's astonishing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. Injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. When we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. And believe me, it does seem endless.|1
"This movie does n't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good . It is truly awful, and it deserves to be banned from all cinemas. The fact that a film that is based on actual events is this terrible should be the first clue that a filmmaker should be ashamed of their work, if they're trying to promote the ""good old days"", but this film is so poorly written, acted and filmed that I have no other words to express my disgust and disgust for it. Why are people giving this movie such low marks?"|0
"This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. It is clear from the start that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. I think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. Sean Bean ""acted"" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was."|1
Some of the secondary actors try , really hard . And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely . But what is truly amazing about these pictures , is that you have to imagine the whole thing to make it work . It takes so much patience . But it's so good . And I can't think of anything else that can make me happier . I'd love to see more like these . Thank you for the kind comments , they are much appreciated . Thanks for your review. I hope this won't be too confusing for you.|0
This film makes several nods to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a Replicant (He is blond haired and is called Ryo, a homage to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?).|1
"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"", they are throwing various props around the room."|1
To keep it as simple as possible . This is a very good show . That is well written , the script is not really too long . I really liked the way that you have been trying to add a bit of spice to it . The show itself is very interesting , it’s not that long and it’s a really good show . This show has potential for it to be one of those shows which everyone should watch for . The story and the way the characters are put together is really cool . I found the writing of the show to be really good .|0
"The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough . But the real problem is more fundamental -- the nature of our national identity. As the recent presidential election demonstrated, even if we want to believe that the United States can be a ""Christian Nation,"" we still have problems with the fact that it has become a Muslim Nation. It is, as we have seen, a nation that is, by all accounts, becoming more secular, more materialistic, more indifferent to its past, and more fearful of change."|0
Last night , I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ) . Oddly , I have never seen Kannathil before , though I did watch a few short films on the Malayalam language. It has been a long while since I last watched this movie and this time I was so excited I didn't know what to think about the movie. KANNATHIL is basically a love story , between a middle aged man , who is in love with a woman and the love they share and the life they lead on the way to their happiness.|0
Okay , . so I went into this loving RuPaul . I still love him/her but think a little less of them . . I still think of their stuff and I still look forward to each of them performing their art form . . just not as much as now . . but that's OK because I love them so much that they dont deserve to go away . . or so they tell me . . but that's not the real me either . . lol . . you know . . . . I still do enjoy watching RuPaul do his thing . .|0
"Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like ""Urban Cowboy"", ""Every Which Way But Loose"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same ""Urban Cowboy"" crowd. Instead ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title."|1
Okay , I love this movie ! ! ! ! ! I watched it over and over again . It's the first movie I ever watched . I have been looking for a movie like the one above for a while . This movie is really cool ! I love it . And I'm sure you will like it . . . . ! ! ! ! ! ! . . . I have seen this movie many times . I really enjoy it . . . ! ! I'm not sure if it's the best . . . !

Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.|1
Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time.|1
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appear in black and white.|1
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen. The visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent Black and White to Color switch. I also thought that The story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clichéd Action Movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do.|1
"Yah . I know . It has the name `` Sinatra '' in the title , so how bad can it be. :-(
I have just downloaded the source code of Sinatra . Now i'm going to see it in action right after my dinner. I'm going to start my server on my workstation. I have to set the environment variable :
export PATH=`pwd;$PATH`

to get a proper path to it. I do not understand where to find the full path to the server file. I think it's important to know where to find a path."|0
"I caught this movie on local t.v . at about 4:30 a.m . I did n't have expectations for it . But I was very pleasantly surprised , considering it's not an original movie . This movie is not bad , just a bit predictable . And it's a little too long . This sequel to the previous one has some interesting plot points . There was one point in the sequel where i thought it was just going to take the same plot points that came before . But it didn't end up that way . The first one ended with me wondering "" is this a continuation of the same story line ? """|0
"Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen . Here are my top 3 picks for this amazing movie. 1) The Black Tulip

By far the best film in my book, I’ve seen everything that comes along in this list. From the amazing visual effects and special effects, to the story that follows it, the entire film, this is simply a masterpiece. As far as the story goes, there are a lot of elements to this film that is so complex that I couldn’t possibly summarize it all."|0
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie. This is deep movie, a pondering of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts (and other who used him) have certainly affected our lives.|1
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi ; it 's a shame . Big Bugs , Snakes , Mythical Beasties , Robots and Aliens are just some of the movies I love , but now I have to pay for a subscription for movies that have been cancelled . What is it about this channel that I need to subscribe for ? I don't like Sci Fi . The new Star Wars prequel trilogy is supposed to have been released on the 25th April and with the new The Force Awakens trailer I'm thinking that they are just trying to make some cash quick by the release of these new movies .|0
One of the more prominent/popular episodes , but clearly one of the worst . A red-shirt female falls for Khan , who is a “bad ass” who is willing to break his “bad ass’s rules” to get her into bed . As the episode progresses , she’ll start to question her life choice to begin with , and the episode goes downhill from there . I really didn’t have any enjoyment out of it . And the ending made me angry because it’s almost like she didn’t even think about how her life choice would affect them .|0
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times Jacqueline rubs herself, the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good.|1
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to take out the killer in my books . All I have to do is figure out if he has a hidden camera or if I am missing something . But this time around I figured it out . It was easy to figure out and it was actually quite entertaining . In the movie, I was just about to give up and go to bed when the last scene hit and it left me in tears . It was almost as if the killer had actually killed me .|0
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. For the life of me I can’t figure out why this one makes me want to punch a guy in the face. I mean it’s such an embarrassing mess that I have to see it again. It’s such a shame because I love it. This movie is one of the most awful films that I have ever seen and I’m glad I can’t find out what went down in that movie.|0
"I just realized why the colors and sets in `` Sakuran '' were so flashy and gaudy , and just thought that they would be perfect for you guys to play in. I am also very pleased with this set and think it would make a great gift set for someone. You should see the full set at my psp, they will be $5,99.00 . It looks sooo cool. Also I was wondering if you guys think it would be too much of a ""deal"" to put together all three sets. I know they are a ""limited time offer"", but that's not really their business."|0
"This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite , which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It's a simple recipe, but tastes as good as it smells. You'll find many variations and ingredients, so I thought I'd include this one. Enjoy! INGREDIENTS

This is a total piece of crap. It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert. They have mangled the story and characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).The 1984 movie was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best.|1
"Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version , with some of the music cut in spots. It's actually quite well done considering how much of the music was taken from the 1933 version. Well, I've gotten a couple comments saying it's not an improvement, but it is very well done nonetheless. You know what this is, right? That's right, the first thing you do when you see the cover art, which is actually the original version, is ""Oh, I remember that."""|0
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again.|1
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show, me and everyone, that a DVD shouldn't be judged by it's cover. ***SPOILERS*** The film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) being too school-girlish to watch.|1
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha. Too many diversions from the actual history. Terrible terrible subtitle!!! I wonder where and who did that subtitle. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was soooo bad! Described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. Honestly, I'm wondering if the film critics of Academy award is that lenient or what?|1
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic , as the whole point of the programme was to expose this kind of behaviour and the fact that it has been going on for a long time , is only just starting to sink in . There is something very rotten in Denmark. I find it disgusting the way that a man with such a big dick can keep this sort of thing quiet and in a way it is disgusting to see this sort of thing being ignored. That’s what it has come to in Denmark.|0
"When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You're in for dark, harrowing films like ""Alice"" and ""Little Otik,"" or short gems such as ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky."" All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."|1
From the start of `` The Edge Of Love '' , the viewer is transported to the striking world of New York City in 1873. The central figure in the story is Edward Blake (Michael Caine), a wealthy young man who owns a string of mansions in the city. During his youth, Edward begins to fall for the daughter of a powerful family, played by Maggie Smith. Unfortunately, his interest in the woman quickly becomes an obsession, and he sets out to acquire the daughter in order to prove his worth as a man.|0
"Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy , insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous ; but there’s something under the surface, something ineffable about him that makes him relatable, and I can’t stop looking for more of that “character.”

At first glance, Fahey seems like one of the characters you’d have to play to win. He doesn’t talk much; he hardly says anything, and the only times we see him speaking come at the beginning of games. That makes him very easy to play with, as long as you want to keep the game interesting."|0
"This film 's a big bore . It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. However, the characters are pretty boring & it is the plot that takes away your interest. The acting was not as bad but it is a bit boring . It was well made , but didn't stand out . I liked this film , although it is not my favourite of the lot but it has a very interesting storyline and a decent amount of characters . Wednesday, 29 January 2015

A story set in the 70's. A young girl lives with her family and her sister."|0
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night . In all my life I have never had to fight a demon . . . I am not that lucky. I need to find a way to defeat it and end all the chaos and evil that it creates . . . a demon that is capable of killing a human . . . one that can destroy my entire world . . . and yet . . . I haven't fought a demon in a long time, not since my father killed it in the kitchen when I was a young kid .|0
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film . The writing , acting , directing could not have been better . The story line is great . The music score , which is the best one that I've heard in many years is superb . If you dont mind at all , then I'd recommend it to you , and it will be a pleasure for you and your family to experience it. You will not have disappointed. I can't wait till I see my children's reactions, and they will be in awe of this wonderful film.|0
In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock , it 's apparent that Big Al 's fear from the police dates back to his teenage years. The movie is about to start with a very similar sequence, which Hitchcock says he is not afraid to take as far as he possibly can. Big Al and his partner go undercover at a gas station to make a deal with an underworld figure, but there's a problem - they're being followed. It's not that the police are watching them. Their job is to do it.|0
While this movie did have a few scary moments ( great use of music and film angles to build suspense ), it was a very well made thriller. The performances were well cast, and the story of a man who loses everything and starts over was quite moving. I thought that it was well acted, and it was a nice change of pace from films like the original The Matrix, and it did a very nice job with the cinematography. I enjoyed it, and found it entertaining and a bit different from other thrillers at the time.|0
the first toxie film was dark , gory , and hillarious . This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz-pop , and you are not prepared to see how bad it is . This film was made by a director who had never had a film screened in his life . It is very hard to get this film into your head . It was very well made , but very poorly acted . It's a good film for the Halloween , but it could have done well in any genre . This is a horror film , and there was no need for the actors to dance .|0
I am utterly astonished at how over-rated `` Cemetery Man '' is among horror fans ! Now , I usually don't agree with Horror movies but I know what it feels like to watch a really good horror movie. I really liked it and I think that is why I was so excited when I first watched the movie. I watched it in theaters a few years ago when it came out. I am just not surprised that most horror fans are not going to care about it as much as I am. I am also not sure why they would think that there are not any true horror movie fans.|0
I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team, as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well, we do get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable tales of family pains, generation gaps and fatherhood, in particular. But it's drama, thankfully, and what drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story could seriously carry a whole movie, if expanded separately.It's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed.|1
Predictable , cliche , unbelievable , boring ... what else can I say ? It 's only the caliber of people like you and a few like him that makes this world a place we can call home. I hope you see the error in your ways, because you know it and that is what is stopping us from moving to a different place and to a better world, where everyone can be happy and free . We have to fight for our freedom , but we can do that , and we will do it , together , one family ! We are one people , one family .|0
"""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie."|1
I seen this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and great soundtrack. I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap (which I did not like)> This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but. This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *ROCK STAR* Yeah I said it.|1
Bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry.|1
If any movie ever made Italians look bad, this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I s--t on your grave. Seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly Mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right?|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. She just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there.|1
This movie is funny if you 're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me ( repeating every word ) when it came out. I'm sure that I would have laughed to death if I were still sitting in the audience. For those that didn't catch it on the big screen, I found the movie pretty good. I'm not so sure it's a good movie, but there's certainly something to the idea that men should not act like men, or at least act in an appropriate way to be a man. I really like this movie.|0
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure.At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational.|1
"This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realise it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK), but this was awful. The family were so cheesy, ""Love you mum"" ""Love you even more honey"" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, ""Love you mum"" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home."|1
This was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless.|1
* * Might contain spoilers * * Ok , lets conclude this movie in one word : bad . Two things you might not know about the film :1. This was supposed to be one of the better films of this year so far2. The film contains a lot of sub plots and things that can get confusing when you first start watching it . For instance , you are supposed to feel sad for the character , but it becomes very hard to figure out what is the point of this character . This movie is a lot of things to keep in mind :1.|0
"Well , at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive . In today's article I thought it was a good moment to discuss what makes for a good horror movie , and in case you missed the beginning article , why I call it ""Hollywood Horror"", you can read it here: http://www.horrornation.com/articles/what-makes-horror-good-films/ . I hope this article would help you make some sense of the horror movies and in the end , I hope this article would help you to understand ""horror"" to a greater degree ."|0
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. Isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?I also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around Southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion.|1
"Perhaps I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama. As to the story it was trying to tell, I found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. And perhaps it should have been made by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented English. I can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar ""artist's model's tragic fate"" plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING."|1
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case . Judge and all, I have not even seen it . I am going back after reading the movie descriptions to see if there is more substance or if I can find it elsewhere . If I can not find it anywhere I will definitely rent it again . I have not seen this movie and I am really liking it . I don't understand why you would rent a movie if it has such poor reviews but I have. . I do not understand why they do not have better reviews for this movie .|0
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour , but nothing more . The sex industry in India has always had a terrible reputation on the global stage due to its poor treatment of the workers and their exploitation . The film portrays the horrific conditions in sex workers camps in India and how these workers were exploited for their sexual pleasure. The film focuses on the fact that the sex workers are forced to do what they are paid for. This film goes into details about how a man was killed for performing a sexual act.|0
"A wasted effort . On the surface it 's a typical disaster movie : we 're involved in the lives of two people and the plot unfolds from one point to the next. I found this to be so unlike a lot of the films out there, which are always the point. There is one point of interest though, and it is the fact that the character of ""the old man"", is a character from the book, but not a real character. This gives a certain ""closeness to the text"" to the film which is really quite unique."|0
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles , death , mystery , and philosophy . In it 's final scenes , the narrator , who we only know as ' nemesis ' tells the story of his life and gives the viewer a choice of the fate that befalls ' nemesis ' . From the first moments you get that it is meant to be a philosophical story . The story is about the quest for enlightenment . The goal is not to make you think of death . It makes you think about life , death and living . The whole movie is like an exercise in contemplation .|0
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews.When Moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this.|1
The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons!|1
"You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to Japan as his career winds down. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager (""Japan's Clint Eastwood""), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball."|1
This movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain (the breather), a female Batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. Not by any means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing.|1
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the ""thief"" was obvious. It was a poor man's (not to mention high school) ""Less than Zero"". I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. So many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. Avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst."|1
"This movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly ""haaaa"" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).For everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled ""comedy."" The movie strictly follows the formula of the later ""Scary Movie"" films, as well as ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating."|1
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.|1
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvellous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score, and witty, light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous, the results are hilarious.|1
no really , im not kidding around here folks , and i so cant believe how many people here have not heard about this , it wouldnt surprise me at all , i mean i can understand if you have a bunch of bad things happening to you with someone that you have been having an affair with , but this is not normal ? i dont think anyone here will be surprised by it , so why would i think that it wouldnt be happening to them , or that i would think that it wouldnt be happening to me ?|0
This is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic, big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.I couldn't believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed.|1
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz . A young mother Selma Lidz ( Andie MacDowell) has a baby boy who was abandoned by his adoptive mother in the middle of a rainstorm when he was an infant. Desperate for her son's identity and her own identity, she returns to the city where she grew up to look for the boy. While searching the city, she meets other mothers who must do the same. They each have a child that they want to give up for adoption to a better life for them.|0
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful! !This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a bad name.Next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. It's like a drunken snail making its way to die.Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's the only thing that kept me watching.|1
"I loved the film `` Eddie Monroe '' . The film had all the components that kept me interested while waiting for the sequel. It was suspenseful to the end. One of the best things of the film is the great cast of characters with all the characters being great. The plot of ` "" Eddie Monroe '' is basically the story of a small town police detective with a passion for a young woman and her child. The plot involves the relationship between a detective and this woman and a child. The film has a lot of suspense and mystery to it."|0
"When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole ""i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff, oh noes what is happening, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait i see something spooky, oh never mind""-sucky storyline."|1
"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about ""cold spots"" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (""it's getting cold!"") Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary."|1
"`` What Alice Found '' is the greatest movie that nobody 's ever heard of ! I underestimated it when I saw it first ! I was surprised to see that I missed some great scenes but it made my heart swell ! I was very shocked that it took me a while to read it ! I didn't want to make it as long as possible as I didn't like to waste too much time on it !

'' What I've Found in my Life, ' is the greatest movie that nobody ever saw ! I didn't realize how much it could hold until I started it !"|0
"Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said ""leave it alone."" Why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 ""Psycho,"" I don't know. My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialog was the same and the story the same.On one hand, I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film."|1
Well , after seeing `` Beginning '' I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor bastard get the hell beat out of him. I didn't think I'd be able to get it and it took a good few weeks to download it, but I did , and here we are, I think I got all of the episodes. I can't remember everything. I only remember a couple , I can't seem to get to the others , I haven't found any that I can play with yet.|0
"if u have n't seen Vijay in `` Ghillli '' , `` Gilly '' or `` Ghillie '' . go and look for them. you'll be amazed.

"There is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: ""In Italy it's the dead who rule"". True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. But foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed."|1
"You know, before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, ""they must have been guilty"" I reasoned?I formed this opinion over some years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He would ""bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be ""back on the street by noon""."|1
"I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur. Her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to ""get away"" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny."|1
Dick and Jane Harper ( Jim Carrey , Téa Leoni ) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation tries to put them back to work as janitors. But it’s all a scam: they’re being set up as part of a scam to get rid of all of the unemployed people, so they can make more money. The scam was run by Jim Carrey for many years. The scam is a fraud, which will result in people losing everything, and the corporation in the end doing nothing because they don’t have the means.|0
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.It is one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like ""Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,"". When I saw that, I figured it would be yet another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff by Disney. But I had no idea how bad.Fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the T.V."|1
"As a big Dostoyevsky fan , I had always been disappointed with Hollywood 's halfhearted attempts to get into the Dostoyevsky world. After reading his story of the peasant boy, ""The Brothers Karamazov"", and seeing his famous story of the murder in ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" (1864), I knew that there was more to Dostoyevsky than I had thought. So I searched the Internet for my first novel, ""Murder in the Cathedral"". It took a little longer than I had expected. On October 21, I submitted my manuscript, and it was turned down."|0
First , and foremost , I take issue to the title of this movie . 'Chupacabra ' is not a movie in the first and second person, it is a horror flick , a thriller , an urban horror . It's a horror film, a thriller , and an urban horror film . For that reason it is not only a good horror film, but it is a good thriller . What makes the film a great horror movie , is that it is the first horror film I've seen since my childhood . So first , let me go back to the story line .|0
"This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (""will the show STILL go on?""). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film."|1
This is a joke , right ? This ca n't be a real film ? It 's not even a comedy , right ? If you put a comedy in that film , I would think that there is more going on. So, you are trying to tell the world how good you are by showing your comedy in this film. There are so many people who already know you, you don't have the guts to show it. I am going to leave the film alone, because it's not funny enough for me, but I want to see if we can get you to make this film.|0
This week 's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun ( La Monja ) directed by Gabino Estrada. I was not expecting anything else, not even this. The film had been screened a week earlier at the same theater as The Nun had been but I didn't know this. The Nun was very good, it was well worth the price of admission. Even with the high price, the film was a surprise. The story was about a beautiful girl, who falls for an American missionary who has adopted her.|0
This film is so 1980 's and that is what I like so much about it . It does an excellent job showing the different sides of the characters in this film and the relationships between the characters . I found the ending of the film to be really cool . But I must say that some of the acting in the film was quite below par I must say . I didn't mind that but the actors themselves did not do an adequate job . There are many great actors in this film that I liked . I think I liked the acting in most of the scenes .|0
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? GIANT cgi versions of these beasts which battle! However I do require one of the guns used in the movie. Because apparently they are using cheats. Count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. Regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.The sound effects used in the movie for the Komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. Oh and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealthy as hell?|1
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says. Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. He's not evenfrom Flint. He just says that to keep his ""blue collar"" look. He's from a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean he went to a private school.His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, that sure does seemlike they suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there."|1
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. In fact, I just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. But no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. I'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which I don't care to ever see or know.What accounts for my hostility to this movie? The characters are not believable. The plot is not believable. The pretentiousness of the movie is sickening.|1
"If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up, I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out ""the reason"" and gets involved in ""the game"" by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a riddle fanatic, and also gets entangled in the game."|1
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to track down and watch a copy of the DVD and find it online. This is my third time seeing this film and my favorite so far. This is one of the films that my wife and I have discussed the idea of watching together since I saw the film for the first time. We are pretty much in agreement with how we feel it should be. It’s not a particularly deep film. It doesn’t make you feel any sense of purpose or meaning.|0
I saw this version about a decade ago , and have been looking for it ever since . I just want to let you all know that i bought a copy from the library today. I like it a lot better than the other versions available. I have to say, there's just so much to love about it. I hope that you like it as well! There's nothing better than a nice quiet place to sit and study. It's rare to have someone sitting around the table and conversing with you. It's a great distraction, and it's always good to have someone else around.|0
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good one. There was just too much potential in the opening of the movie that I didn't want to see taken away. It's a shame that this one wasn't as interesting as I would've wanted it to be, because I would've loved for it to be better. The movie has some great moments, I enjoyed the action sequences and those of us who have seen the movie in theaters have enjoyed the story. The film has a good cast.|0
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature footage, bad acting - Aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well off each other. There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I do say so myself.The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day.|1
Okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. Mr. Cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess?|1
It may be , although there are still two or three I 've missed . This film constructs an interesting and compelling narrative of the way the West was lost as a people in the face of the Soviets . . . and then, in the wake of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War in the 1990's, the West came to its own again . . . it also tells a story about those who have become the West . . . and how it all came to be. Although it's not always clear exactly who's speaking on the film .|0
"What a mess--and I'm not referring to the ""destruction"" in the title. I could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there weren't any palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it at that.Hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on IMDb.. OK, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing."|1
"Not the best plot in the world , but the comedy in this movie rules . Kelsey Grammar is wonderful actress and this movie has just enough laughs . It's not a masterpiece , but it has everything you could expect from the star of the movie . I enjoyed the film very much , I have not seen this one before . It was so enjoyable ! This film is available for free streaming , if you want to stream it , you can download it from our website

"The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I 've seen in a long time -and I 'm not just talking about the town itself but about its people

The story is told of how a man in a red suit, standing in the middle of a crowded street in a town far from home took a small coin from his jacket pocket and offered to share it with the people there in the street. ""This is all I've got,"" said the man. ""Give it to us all!"" they shouted."|0
As far as fake documentaries go ( fakumentaries anyone ? ) , this one is up there with the best, if not the most realistic ( if not the most realistic ) in terms of how it depicts a historical event in the past, the only thing it lacks was some kind of a climax to it. Not being a historical historian, I haven't seen much of the film, but I think it could have made a decent documentary. It could have been more factual, but it's still pretty engaging. Of course, it does take itself way too far.|0
Why are there no good reviews ? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War 2 Japan, this is based on a true story - the story of a Japanese soldier that was executed for stealing from a captured German pilot during a POW exchange in Hawaii in the 1940's. The Japanese soldier in question stole from the Germans because he thought the German officer was his friend. He then stole the Japanese pilot from the POW exchange. He stole from both sides and committed suicide after he realized he was wrong.|0
"I really wanted to like this film , especially after all the buzz I 'd heard revolving around it . But when I sat down to read about it, the film seemed a lot less interesting than it should be . A few things that didn't go with my idea of what the story should be. The trailer
I really liked the first trailer . It was short, it showed you what the entire film was going to be , and it made me feel like there wasn't that much of a wait . I've been to other trailers, and I've never really gotten that impression before."|0
"The 1998 version of ""Psycho"" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because ""it was air conditioning."" I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen)."|1
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's and I always thought it would be great to put it into a big screen in a big movie and it is. It's a very good movie with some great performances all around, a wonderful soundtrack, and a great love story. It's a really good movie. I would love it to be played in a movie theater because that would be so great. I don't know if anyone has ever seen it, but I would love to see a movie theater version.|0
"""Yesterday"" as a movie, is hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film."|1
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno ( Alex Linz ) in a catholic school who is involved in a drug deal and he is kidnapped by two other kids that go by the nickname “Raspeals” (Gaby Hoffmann and Gaby Hoffmann Jr ). In the end of this film they convince him to go for a test drive of their stolen vehicle and it goes bad. This film is a comedy in its simplicity. There is one character, one actor and a story that can go on for a hundred and twenty five minutes.|0
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was I wrong. This film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. I cannot comment on the ending because I just couldn't stand watching the whole film. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. So if you are having trouble with sleep then I recommend that you rent this film.|1
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman 's writing ( especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in `` The Dream Hunters '' ) for some years now, it's only logical that I would become a fan of his latest novel and, of course, to start reading it. And, truth to tell, to start it I did not even bother to search the web site. Neil's latest novel will not disappoint...

Gaiman's first foray into comics ( and the best comic I have read up to date in this genre ) is not exactly what one expects when you read a comic like this."|0
This rendition of `` Noah 's Ark '' has set Hallmark 's ( and Turner 's ) reputation back about 15 years. The story has been retold many times, and it is now an annual tradition, but it's not one I see many people do, since the images do not really do justice to the story or its setting. For that reason, this one is not for your family. But if you don't think you can handle the story, here it is anyway. You may have heard the story of the Flood, but that wasn't what we thought it was about.|0
Not the best of the WIP 's , but not the worst either . I honestly feel guilty laughing at the end of this, because this was so good, I wanted to read it over and over again . The story itself was good and I really enjoyed it, although there were a number of things I didnt like. For example the first half of the story was boring, the second half was sooo much longer that I felt I was going to have to skip to the last page of the book just to get it to end.|0
this film was probably the best `` scary film '' i 've seen in years . chilling might be a good descriptor , but i don't really feel it is . the only good thing going for this is , as far as a horror movie , it has a lot of potential to become a great movie . i'm a horror buff , not to the point of getting gagged at the theater . i love horror movies , and i enjoy this movie . it is , however , a rather slow , boring film .|0
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film, it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege.|1
I 'm a fan of the horror movie , regardless of which hemisphere it comes from . I know what the movie is about and have a pretty good understanding of what is going on , but what makes this film so special ? It's actually one of those movies I can definitely recommend to anyone , regardless of what your particular horror sensibilities may be . It's just a really great horror movie . . . in fact, I'd recommend it . . . . . It's the first movie I've ever recommended . . . . to anyone . . . .|0
If I had to pick the most depressing movie , try to be suspenseful I 've seen it 'd be hard , the first two were very suspenseful , I like the third very much . The rest I can watch without any emotion . If I could choose one , it would be the first 3, because I think that is a very suspenseful movie in terms of suspense . I think that was suspenseful because the suspense comes from the fact that the girl is not going to get away and the killer can kill her . The last 2 were very suspenseful .|0
An untidy man , known as Bill , lives in a small dreary flat , with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on his wall , which has always been there. But the poster is always in shadow . It is evening, late afternoon, early evening. He has just finished cleaning his flat and is about to get dressed. There is a smell in the flat of smoke from a candle, and the smell is familiar to him, he knows it all too well. He goes to the kitchen and lights a cigarette and sits down at the table.|0
Yet another in the long line of `` Do n't '' films of the late 70 's and early 80s, this one actually did make some money. Maybe not a ton, but it's a film worth seeing regardless of how it plays. This time it stars the late, great actor Peter Cushing as an Irish soldier who is on his way home to his family on a trip he didn't make. But he gets caught in a snowstorm, so he decides to go home for the night. His family tells him they don't believe him. And so do they.|0
"The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable . It was just one of those things where you get to see the characters and you think, “This is great! How did they find this person so fast? This is how they make it all work.”

And I guess what I’m really asking myself is, what was that? Was it a coincidence or was there something interesting going on here? This movie is very, very funny, and very well-written. There are moments that are a little clunky and moments where I just find myself rolling my eyes."|0
"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids!"|1
I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! Talk about so bad it made me laugh!Firstly, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, I couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what I was seeing. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff.|1
As I looked at this movie once again, I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. It has the gripping ending, the deranged murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great on-location shots, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies.|1
"In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD's on ""junk"". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.The movie didn't really do it for me. The ""Good Guys"" weren't any more good than the ""Bad Guys"". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I just didn't care which side won."|1
"Dire! Dismal! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing!Right, your trapped in ""The Cave"" with several ""hard"" Men and a Woman or two, your being systematically killed by ""Something"" and you STILL don't get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A 15 Cert' here in England, and you could tell!The Egos of the ""Macho Men"" was just too much, pass the bucket I'm going to be sick.This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever."|1
"This film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but ""Sweet and Lowdown"" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable, that I do not want to now about him, or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore."|1
First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!? !If any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it.|1
I am 17 , and a biased Muppet fan , and while I love Treasure Island , Christmas Carol and The Muppet Movie , I have not yet caught up on the entire Muppets saga. I still remember the day I first saw The Muppets the movie. I can remember the theater was packed with people sitting in their seats waiting for the beginning to begin. As soon as the movie came on I started talking to my neighbor who is a Disney fan. He told me that if I could get me and my buddy to see the movie it would be worth my time.|0
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. For something made by an eighteen year old film student, I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti stick to the documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around Portland writing graffitti. He is joined by another and they skate around together creating art.|1
"Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. Don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. This movie really stands out. ""Hair"" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. There is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music."|1
"So, this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It's up there with ""Crossbones"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares!"|1
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden, then we should take this stinker down to Gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. They'll be singing within minutes. Of course, I'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the Geneva Convention in several ways. Look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch TV at home. So take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little TV zombie. She got up and walked away after about ten minutes. That's how bad this is.|1
"When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here.One of the other users commenting on this states ""This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart"". I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is ""classic"" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality."|1
Thank god for this movie . It 's a document of talent that , three decades later , seems even funnier and more poignant than it was a few years ago . there is , as far as i remember from the late eighties , no more than one good joke in the whole damn thing . if you want to hear a few , it is in my collection and i 'll put them here for y'all : ) . there are three really great jokes , but they 're in two distinct parts . the second one is the best : ) .|0
This movie is about pathetic , spoiled , ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say , performed well and even have an interesting story , and then watch their egos destroy the lives of their loved ones at the hands of other egos. It is so pathetic that you almost want it to stop , because there is no way that the story can go any other way! The story is written in the first person, so it feels like an autobiography that you are writing in front of the mirror. I feel like you are in the same movie, and you feel trapped .|0
When the Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager.|1
"I heard legends about this `` film '' ( quotes used so as not to insult films ) for a long time. In this film, you see a small girl, who lives on the coast of Mexico, trying to get her life started. It is a long journey in the beginning, but she makes it! For the rest of the film I find myself going "" WTF !!! "" I don't think that the film will be for everyone and I am not recommending it. The movie is beautiful, but I wouldn't want to sit down and watch it while driving."|0
"A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in ""Double Indemnity,"" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher."|1
As embarrassing as it is to admit , I was listed as production manager on this film ... my very first script ever to be written and directed by a professional director and I had to do the work and find a place to stay to do the film. I had to find a studio for the shoot and then find someone to live with so we could do the filming and the final editing. I had to find a car and find a location to use for the shoot as I didn't own a car and I had to find a place for the crew to live in.|0
"Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother/Daughter Estrangement, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really ""sells"" their roles."|1
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film, but with Today You Die, I feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.So here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.There was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. If he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.These days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part.|1
Robert Aldrich 's brutal , quasi-black comedy `` The Grissom Gang '' , a reworking of the 1948 British film of the same name, was a huge hit at the time of its original release in 1948, and continues to attract many of its fans in the decades since. It was not until the mid-1980s that the title of the film's original source material was officially acknowledged. Aldrich began shooting the film back in 1951, but never completed it. The story follows the titular gang of Grissom brothers, along with several other gang members and associates, in the 1950s, when they were part of a nationwide crime organization.|0
The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was ... not very good at all.Like others , I felt the movie was rushed (I don't need to explain why...I think I may have seen the movie a few weeks earlier and it wasn't what I had expected). The cast is great, though. I really enjoyed them. I didn't think they had any chemistry with the other characters though. I didn't think they were believable in any scenes. I don't think they did their jobs as actors either, but some scenes did feel a bit rushed.|0
Disclaimer : During my ventures into foreign cinema , I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies . However , there are a handful of movies that I have become obsessed with , from a technical aspect , I can’t pick a favorite. In the case of this review , my focus is more on the cinematography than story . There are so many ways to approach a film on its cinematography that it is very hard to pick one or two films to compare . The beauty of it is that you can choose any of them and find something you like .|0
"A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean ""laughs"", and it doesn't necessarily mean ""light"". It basically means you're not bored while watching it. As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience."|1
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and the only way to get rid of them is to get to know her. This is part one in a three part mini series, the last part will be coming out on the 29th of October. The last part will give us more of the story which will lead up to her demise. The first part was posted on the 27th of August 2015 and the last part will be out on the 29th of October and will give you a glimpse into what went down.|0
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth. Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash. Then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set. And to make matters worse, EVER heard of stereo? If the camera switches, the sound always stays centered.|1
The plot involves a new , hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin 's barbershop . the new shop promises to be the greatest . heres hoping it happens . this is as great as this franchise is going to be . and i'm hoping to be the new best guy at the new place . i got a lot of new ideas for this new franchise . so this is gonna be so good . there are a lot of new guys , but there's one guy here that will really help the franchise to be even better than before .|0
"Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense."|1
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's celibate lesbian manager.|1
The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time , but it has always interested me , and I am sure that I will always remember it fondly. As we all know, it has left a lasting legacy, and I am very proud to have been a part of that legacy. I don’t really consider myself a Vietnam war historian , I am rather a history buff, and I feel that I am as qualified as anyone to do so. In fact, I am probably more qualified to write a book on the war than anyone else who might write a book.|0
"The St. Francisville Experiment claims ""this ain't no walk in the woods"", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming! !I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's ""paranormal consultant"" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie."|1
So bad , it 's entertaining , especially during cocktail hour , and believe me , you 'll need a few glasses of it . But for real , you 'll find yourself wondering why is that so hard to get , why it 's so expensive ? I mean I could of seen it in a restaurant for 5-6 dollars a plate , but it seemed a bit expensive for such a low price point . Then again there were a handful of restaurants that were willing to do a small takeout price , or at least I had seen them , they seemed like good places .|0
"Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy , about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a ""lady of means"" at her holiday home . She arrives, accompanied by her young daughter and her maid, with a gift basket which, it is revealed, contains a secret that she never intended to reveal . What is the secret ? And how does the young lady get rid of it? And how does it relate to the secret she didn't reveal ? And how will it affect the lady in her life ? And what is the lady's reaction when she realises the secret is not hers ?"|0
"If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man 's testicle , or look at a row of pathetically deformed genitals, that's just how you're going to do it. ""What is this? Is it for food? Or is it something you should not be seen with?"" reads a note taped to a door of a man's genitals that appeared on Wednesday in a case in the Central District Court. A man, named ""Him,"" reported that he was bitten by an unknown attacker on March 22, 2012."|0
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time.|1
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film.|1
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to Hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring!!! The acting in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as though some people from an Evangelic Church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. It wasn't real-life dialog at all.|1
"Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously.... Scott is a shady character who preys on women. In this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California.The sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version.Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", one of Hitch's reputed favorite films."|1
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work.|1
Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore 's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as awesome as they come. It's not so much a film as a dance. It isn't so much about a story but about the choreography of a fight scene. It's about how much can be done with a dance movement. Rudy was not just an awesome choreographer he was a great choreographer. The whole time I was watching this film I was hoping he'd go down fighting. I couldn't get that out of my head. I was excited about the fights.|0

Eddie Fischer was simply bad . Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a home, beat up the family of one of the children, and took all the food that they had put out the night before. You would think this would have been the first time he’s broken into somebody’s house, but after that you can see that it was only a few times in the course of his life before he finally put an end to those poor people and their family. There were so many scenes like this that it made it into a movie.|0
This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters, a great story, and it is all made to make you wonder '' why is this guy still doing this in this country''. But you know what you can do when you find yourself in a place like this, with this kind of scenery, with this kind of atmosphere? You can '' get up and start writing a book.'' I think that is exactly what these people are doing with their lives.|0
Okay , make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film , but I actually thought it had a pretty good story. I mean, there are moments here and there that feel rushed, and not enough focus on how the plot is tied together. The script is good , but if I'm not mistaken it does not feel like it has much in it to tie everything together, even though I know the director has put alot into it. The ending is also a bit cheesy. And I can't really tell you how much of it I loved.|0
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome! Check it out and you'll be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. Both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. The music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict.|1
This was an interesting movie . I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWWW! - but they did a good job of building up the suspense. I enjoyed it and I have a few of the scenes, so it is on my shortlist for viewing. But I am not a fan of the movie overall . I liked it at first but I found myself wishing the movie went a little faster . If you liked it, it's on DVD, and if you don't, there are many, many other movies like this that you won't care for!|0
Red Skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox ' on a radio-show called the Fox Hour. The Fox Hour airs every weekday morning from 9:30 to 11:30am in most areas. The series premiered in January 1964. In September of that year, the first episode was transmitted. The series was revived in May 1971. In January 1978, the series was transferred from CBS to ABC, for which the Fox Hour was cancelled. The show then began airing in syndication, from September 1979 to May 1981.|0
First of all , just let me say this ... Ghost Story .... hello ! ? ! If any of you out there want to help me out with this script I will really appreciate it. I have been doing this script for the last 2 years and would really appreciate it if people could give it a whirl and share their results with me ! I would really appreciate it !! I have also been thinking a lot about creating a short story script to use for a project I've been talking with a couple friends about and I'd really like to use this to create something.|0
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig.|1
I kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. It just meandered along to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.|1
This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row , public domain films from the first half of the 20th century. But it is more enjoyable if you like films of another era. It is a bit of a shock to me that a film like this has never been released on DVD. But it would be a lot more fun if it had been released on DVD, because it would make for a more enjoyable film. It would even give it more credibility if it was released on DVD. However, if it was released as part of a box set, it probably wouldn't make for much.|0
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? This is one of those films. It was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity.In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language.|1
"Mixed group of ""experts"" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. The cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-aiming effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels."|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma, being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.|1
It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time. The storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I don't even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor.|1
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie.|1
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them. I have to confess, I was pretty shocked at how bad this was. It wasn't terrible, it's not even really that good, but I didn't see anything else that was even remotely bad that they were showing. I saw the trailers, but I didn't think anything was worth the time or effort, so I stopped watching it. However, I saw it when it came out and it made a lot of sense.|0
RIFIFI ( Jules Dassin - France 1955 ) To me , it seems a very risky idea to attempt a film on such an idea. So much of what I see on the news of the world is not true. It seems to me that there are some things that are not really true but I still feel like they are important. This is why we need to be able to see films that give a true account of what is going on in this day in order for us to know what to expect. A true film is the most truthful of all documentary films.|0
"I used to think that it couldn't get worse that ""Army of the Dead"" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like ""The Godfather""!! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes the acting, put it this way, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, when compared to these D-List (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses."|1
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell pictures for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the movie. I didn't see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY, promising I'd be back.|1
"Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what would be included. My expectations were not disappointed and it looks to be an interesting set. The first book in the Qatsi Saga was published in English in 2008. In 2014, there was a re-print in the UK, as well as a paperback and ebook version, and a re-release in the US. There was also a new hard cover edition. There have been no new Qatsi releases so far since then. QATSI

The QATSI is a series of four books, published in English in 2013 and 2014."|0
Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. When in theory we should be watching for the narrative.The plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!|1
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (I may get to watch another one, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is out). For all star John Carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all! ; James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's manservant.|1
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful ! ! This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name. This movie was full of horrible scenes, disgusting acting, disgusting characters, poor writing, and no substance. It was not good and it is not getting any good reviews. The film was a complete waste of time and money. It is not worth watching for those who are looking for great entertainment and fun. If you're interested in reading a review, you can look at the one posted on the site. I don't have an online review, just a transcript.|0
"I would like to know if ""The Outsiders"" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD?There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total.The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called ""Black Forest Clinic"" which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync. I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions, thank you in advance."|1
I 've seen various Hamlets , and I 've taught the play . As I watch Jacobi , I 'm not so sure what to think . The first thing that strikes me is the fact that the young girl , who seems to be playing a part, is not the daughter of the playwright 's brother. She is a member of a different generation. I think it is interesting , but I can see it as just another Hamlet . This one has a different cast . I would think that Hamlet's family would have more influence on the course of his destiny.|0
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she was supposed to be a depressive, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more a depiction of a self-centered, worthless sh!tbag than a victim and survivor of depression.The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her. Sorry but I couldn't buy it. This is straight to video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.|1
"JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure Sam Nell ( The Dish ) , William Macy ( Happy Texas , Fargo ) and Peter Ustinov ( Downton Abbey ) star, and this weekend sees the three stars take a trip to New York. *

It sounds like it could be pretty good, but don’t take it from me; it could be bad. It’s the third installment of the three-part adventure series that will see an all-new cast. The show’s stars — William Macy , Sam Nell and Peter Ustinov — are looking to show off the rest of the team at the end of this series."|0
"A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" of the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent."|1
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival . Since I work in the wine business , I’m always interested to find new wines to try and this is a good reason to see a film I am already a fan of . I was expecting a bit more romance than what was there , although there were moments of suspense . And if I had to nitpick , I’d just have to say that the characters aren’t well-developed . It’s too much the same. But I’m always glad to see things like that in a film .|0
This movie is an example of small budget , ineffective star cast , weak storyline and poor entertainment . This movie is made up of two parts . The first part is great entertainment but the other part is just soo bad . The movie is not about how much you love your kids but how you want your children to have happiness and love for each other , no matter how you are feeling about it . This film was created for the kids to watch but I think its too much for them . Kids need to feel something for each other .|0
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels , do n't expect anything deep and meaningful . If you 're looking for an exciting, action-packed sci-fi flick, there's nothing in that genre that will satisfy you. But if you don't want to be left wondering what happens next , that's fine. Wild Rebels won't ruin the movie genre, but it won't leave you breathless either. That is if you're looking for a good, old-fashioned Sci-Fi movie that has a bit of humor and a whole lot of drama. Here's what Wild Rebels might have in it.|0
"I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life , but none are coming to mind right now that I would rather go to a football match then go to church! There will be no other game on the TV in my life! That is the way I feel, and that is the way I will live my life , for the next few months! Monday, 3 April 2015

If you are a Christian you are well aware of the fact that God is love. All that is required to prove it is to be able to demonstrate how God is love."|0
No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original.|1
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well.|1
I usually seek to find good in movies , even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail. There is always that one moment that sticks out like a sore thumb ,but I think it wasn’t as effective as many of my favorites. This one isn’t that bad. What’s your favorite movie? A little about the movie. It opens with a couple walking out the front doors of their hotel. They have just come home for the day after a day of touring Europe and their friends and loved ones.|0
Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film `` experts . '' He is back with yet another film where he has to keep up with the plot of a film. He seems to like his work and that is why he continues with it. The plot is simple as he keeps repeating it. I would say it is a good plot and good film. I like a good plot, and this one is good. It is a good plot with good acting by the lead actors. The film has a good script and a decent cast.|0
Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in . I have not seen all of his other movies, but I have seen parts of them. SHRUNKEN HEADS did not have a great reputation in the film world. I think the reason that he is so beloved in Hollywood and he is still a household name is because of his incredible work in films like THE STREET ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT, the original STAR WARS, and I think it was THE MISSION OF RAPUNZEL that made him famous, along with his fantastic voice and acting work in films like THE HISTORICAL MISTAKES.|0
Oh f*cking hell, where should I start... First of all; this show is just another stupid American non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. The American way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example).|1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!|1
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean , the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) arrives at his factory, which has been taken over by the state. His former employees, who were workers of the previous regime, are waiting for him. He decides to stay for two days and to pay his taxes. But when he is invited to the main house of the local government, he decides to flee. The film opens with the sound of gunshots in the distance, and then, in the second and third scenes, the sounds of helicopters and tanks moving into the city.|0
I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.|1
Great book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude.|1
"For the first time in reviewing films , I found myself immediately uninterested in this story . I do n't know how much of the original story is retained from the theatrical version , I don't know who wrote the screenplay , I am not sure if they made any attempt to recreate the dialogue , but it wasn't necessary for this story , there were so many scenes from the original story that are not reproduced , they are all re-used. I understand why some of the actors were recut , but it should not have happened

I would have preferred a shorter film , just to keep the film length ."|0
Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers.|1
"As was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former ""Wayne's World"" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films."|1
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the IRA and goes on the run in London !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . Things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a stark realism . However as soon as Fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( What ?|1
"I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with the gratuitous sex although I admit the rotational style of bonking was something I had not seen (nor experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The ""Oakville Tribune"" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario???)"|1
"Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says ""Isn't that clever? Am I not smart? Isn't that biting social commentary?"" And,sadly, the answer is always ""Ummmm...no."" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality."|1
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment, and her daughter, who, as a young woman, was raised in a very traditional Christian environment and then she went through a period in her life where she was forced to come to a point of self-exploration and spiritual discovery. What I like very much about the relationship between the mother and daughter in this movie is this: it is not so much a spiritual relationship as it is a relationship of love and trust based on a very deep trust in God’s character.|0
I really like the show ! ! As a part of Greek Life , I can say that some things I didn’t like ,but there is great things in it ! What I like: – I really liked the characters. I like them. It was interesting to meet them. I’ve read a lot of books about their lives and I liked some of it and some of it, but I liked the book more than the characters. It’s a great story that you can pick up and learn from.|0
when this show first came to Disney, i love it started watching all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.I do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. I hat that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I mostly don't like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses the crap outta me.|1
I did have some expectations from this film because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star(??!) cast was new. Well, I must tell u that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that).|1
In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during WWII. In a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.This is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the Ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated.|1
Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable , and overacted . This movie could n't make up it 's loss. I saw the second one too. The original one was a bit much for me. The third one was so much better .The first one was good enough for me but not really enough. The third was better.The fourth one had some really good stuff in it,but I felt the story was a bit overacted .I would re watch it again, but it is really hard to understand what is going on . In my opinion , the story is too long.|0
"I found this an awfully disappointing experience! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.This ""Felicia's Journey"" is intriguing. It has drama. But it is full of stereo-types! So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of ""NEWS"" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! It is SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairytale of ""Little Red Ridinghood""!"|1
"Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or ""artsy fartsy"" as some people would say. I assure you, that after one viewing, ""Bobbycrush"" will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film."|1
This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series , creepy beyond words . The tension and fear is so well handled and the ending leaves the viewer breathless . What I liked most about it, was the characters that were introduced to the world, and how the way they were portrayed, they made sense . It was a very well crafted episode , and I hope you enjoy the rest of the series . I really recommend it, it is a great series , and one that should not be missed. This is a fantastic episode from the beginning of the series.|0
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen , right from the start the movie goes straight down to the point that you are not going to believe it , even after the first 5 minutes I was like “this is not a movie” and it kept going like that until the end. The story is just not going to make a lot of sense to anyone without knowing the story first , the story is just not very good. This is not the greatest film I have ever seen but I will give this a 10 out of 10.|0
"Everyone 's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had nothing to contribute or who were just plain trolling. For example, here was the thread:

The first thing you should know about `` Zipperface '' is that it was shot on video , so it has nothing to do with the movie and the story doesn't revolve around the character. There is, of course, a little movie-related trivia, but it's better to get it all out of the way now, so you can see the movie. The movie opens on a train heading north to Chicago , where the story takes place. There is a young woman whose life is completely different from what most people know.|0
NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't allow my children to see this. I definitely would tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof as to why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network The producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot wasn't even born when this event took place. Did anyone attached to this project try reading the Bible?|1
"Countenance! Antoine Monot, in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, understated old-school bard of ""There's something about Mary"" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. In visual allure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere."|1
"This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a ""10"") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie."|1
OK , this movie , was the worst display I have seen in years . The actors were n't to great , the sets were small , the scenes were weak , the story seemed like it was in its infancy . but I am so glad that it's here . I think that I might have had the best time I have had since I began watching this movie . and I don't want to hear any whining about how terrible it is . This is one of my all-time favorites . and it should be in all the dvds .|0
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US.Anyway, this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy...)Why: Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. (Examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends.|1
I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film missed its marks. Several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. It sets you up for the laugh. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. They weren't funny unless you were five.|1
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful , but damned if it did n't break new and exciting ground! This is one of the best movie I have watched this year. It has a great storyline, very well acted, very entertaining and has great scenes. The actors are all really good. I would highly recommend you to see this movie to your loved ones or yourself. Great job to make it a huge hit!!! It is a must see if you are a die hard fan of Korean dramas. Sang-ok is one of my favorites.|0
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito. The series' star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think, if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor).|1
"Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch? And I got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is ""different"", someone nobody understands... She is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. Besides, Brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so... Fake."|1
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock, it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: ""He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour."" The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police. ""Strangers on a Train"" is probably one of the best in his ""wrongly-accused"" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series."|1
`` Flashdance '' meets `` Meatballs III '' or maybe it should just be called `` Meatballs IV '' . This is not the game I was looking for. The gameplay is great but there is a big problem with the graphics. For starters the game looks old and ugly. To start the game you have to get through several levels until you get to a level where you have to shoot out the enemies. Once you do that your game becomes very challenging. I would recommend that you start playing with at least five players and have the game end after you finish playing with them.|0
The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a `` pod '' system that is almost like virtual reality. The game is played by one player, which is controlled by an avatar that appears as a human or an android. The avatar is basically just a holographic image created in 3D by a game developer. eXistenZ features two very different protagonists. In one version, played by a man in his 20s, the avatar looks like an ordinary man. However, he is able to move his hands, talk, make gestures, and even talk to the player through an audio link.|0
"Pete's Meteor. I seen this referred to as ""authentic"" and a ""gem."" I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kinda wished that I didn't.Apparently this was noted as being Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother."|1
"Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: Sean Connery as the wily Arab sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that ""big stick"" to good use.Aided immeasurably by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg."|1
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie. There's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations.It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the Illuminati. The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place.|1
I logged on here right after watching this movie, feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. And so, since I want the job done right...From the opening shot, the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard.|1
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his work and was never a huge fan of many of his movies. However, if you've never seen his work, it's something to check out and enjoy for the sake of it. He's in a whole different league as an actor. This is the type of stuff he's capable of doing with a voice. I like it. You'll be surprised when you hear about the new Mickey Rourke movie in the spring. What did they say at ComicCon?|0
Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this.|1
This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue.|1
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly is n't a perfect movie , but I 'm pretty sure it was never intended for the general public to enjoy. The idea that an alien could have brain damage, and not die, would seem ridiculous to most, I know, but when you add it to this idea that it would be something as horrible as that... It was meant to be funny, which is fine, but it should never have been intended for everyone to laugh at its absurdity. There's something really sad about a movie that is a complete disaster from beginning to end.|0
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie , like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the 50' monster movies that came before it. What is different is that it has no monster to scare you, it's about three guys in their early twenties who try to get to know each other before moving on to other things. This is the third film based off of the original story and it doesn't disappoint, though I'm not sure how many of the things they're doing are actually real.|0
"One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.As nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! The cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, the one of the ""Shining"" is funfair! NB: a lot of users think that it is located in the French Riviera! They are wrong!"|1
This film has it 's heart in the right place , but unfortunately , it is n't much of a comedy ! !!! It was ok at one point ,but as the plot goes on , it just falls apart ! I think what really makes the film enjoyable are the performances , even when the characters seem ridiculous , they still give it some charm. !!! This movie is definitely not for everyone , as some of the dialogue is rather ridiculous . !!! And there is no one in it who has any acting skills ! !!!|0
So well done. The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. It's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. It's the best performance that I've seen from Ms. Capshaw--she's been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.|1
"Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said ""Don't be stupid, be a smartie. Come and join the nazi party"". It brought us delightful films, such as 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane! ', and even 'Naked Gun'. But the good die young. Luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. And then... the Wayan's Brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'Scary Movie'. Suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes."|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months . The plot of the story was uninteresting , but the actors were so boring , I can not even describe how bad it was . The lead actor of the film was so forgettable . I had not seen a film like this before and I have been watching movies like this for a long time . I really hated this film . The story of the film was very interesting , but the acting was so bad . The actors were supposed to be very good , and they were not , they were just a bunch of bad actors .|0
"This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the ""good"" sister is just silly. It is Anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not Mary's, that has been told so often.In response to an earlier review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so ""criminal""... to me it's Henry who was the real criminal."|1
"Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies (e.g. the English Patient), but have far less appeal.After the first half-hour I started checking my watch, wondering if I'd make it home in time to catch Leno on tv.I passed up ""Gladiator"" to see this!? !"|1
"This movie was cheesy and it was more than that . It was about this guy who gets a curse on him, and ends up in a parallel universe. This movie was really funny at the beginning, but it just went downhill after that . All throughout the movie this guy is in a really bad place and he just can't find out what he really is. At the end he dies. 4/10/10

Funny, sad, cute

This movie was very funny at the beginning, then it just became more sad and then it just went downhill and the ending was just cheesy."|0
( The beginning might be a spoiler ... ) '' The Eye 2 '' is the sequel to `` The Eye ``, and is set after the events of the first film. This sequel has more action, more action in more places, and even a few scenes involving sex (one or two) for those of you that are not old enough to be shocked by the sight of young children having sexual intercourse. The ending of '' The Eye '' wasn't what we were expecting, so '' The Eye 2'' is definitely not what anyone was expecting either.|0
To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.And, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors.|1
With a cast like this , I knew the acting would be amazing . Still , I was cautious , because we are talking about two of the leading actresses of our generation. But we are talking about a talented actress of our era . So no matter what, I will give it a try. I don’t want to get hurt again. This time, it was very bad . I think there is one scene that sticks out for me , that I won’t regret . In fact , I think it is one of the greatest scenes of my career as an actor and director .|0
I loved this movie when it first came out ( but i was just 12 years old then - and still like it) and i still love it and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there who is into horror. the first time i heard it was on the radio and i didn't really remember it but it sounded like a lot of other movies i liked at the time, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare On Elm Street, The Exorcist and the rest. it was pretty good, but at the same time a bit silly.|0
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And a more off-the-wall storyline too!A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed.|1
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the right elements of being a classic old movie, but it's really a modern movie with great acting and a really clever plot, not to mention the beautiful cinematography and some wonderful visual effects and effects editing .... and I love that the film is made in New Mexico and is set against a beautiful backdrop. For those who have not seen it, I highly recommend that you take the time to see it for yourselves ... It is not as well known as it deserves to be.|0
I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.|1
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable.|1
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate . It is an hour and half waste of a film . I liked it very much , but I just don't see it as anything other than a complete waste of $30 . At least this is one movie that could have been made for only $6 . This is one of those movies where if you could have made it for $10 it would have been a winner . This movie started out with some pretty good ideas . The plot is solid , and the characters are great .|0
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses.|1
This is such a fun and funny movie . Highly entertaining at all angles . It features an outlandish array of talent and brings out the best and worst in the actors . And as the title states , it's a comedy centered around a trio of women . It's a perfect example of what's wrong with modern day women . If you don't have the time or desire , you can watch the movie , as it's available on Netflix and you can order it from Amazon . As for those that don't have the time , the book is a great introduction to these characters and their struggles .|0
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know...but how good is it? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****SPOILER****When a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow.|1
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance).|1
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville, FL, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order.|1
Watching this odd little adventure movie , it 's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who directed that other movie , that one which was a masterpiece , but which has become a bit of a cult classic and one which should be in everyones DVD collection . The story is not well-known , but it 's one which could have made a great film and if the movie makers have done their work right . I will admit , the first half was a bit slow , but the second half was amazing . It had a perfect balance between the action and the suspense .|0
"George Sluizer 's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time . Why was it even made ? Because it had no interest for most of the world - except a small handful that would watch it and then be told to watch it again because it was ""great"" and a ""hit"". The first five minutes of this film tell that story. The rest is filler - it's almost the same scene repeated twice without any change in the characters. The biggest problem with this film is the same as a lot of the other bad ones - it's a total bore."|0
It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. To this end he has made an excellent, objective film. Spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech Amercians and auld-Europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.Nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means.|1
This was a great movie , I would compare it to the movie The Game . You get to the end of this movie and you are done , and you know what, the film ends and it has nothing to do with the ending. I think a good movie should end in a good way . I think that The Game had the same ending. It didn't have to be as complicated , just the same . The ending of this movie makes it the best movie , because the ending makes it so much more entertaining .|0
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good rendition of the story. I enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. But the second half was horrible!!! Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie Scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from God.|1

This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War--most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION--a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer.|1
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers.|1
"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books."|1
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.Bogart is always good.|1
I do n't even know where to start . I did not like it . It did not behave like the others I played through . First game, I just wanted to see how the story would end. After the first battle and after the final boss, it was fun to play, but I didn't expect the ending that would occur after the first boss. After fighting through all the waves, I was disappointed to see that I would never have enough health to beat all the bosses. I just didn't see how the game was supposed to end.|0
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. I was expecting a lot of sex and some action, and it ended up being all sex. I think it would have been much better if the movie had a couple of good scenes of romance. There's a scene where a girl tries to kiss a guy but the guy looks at her for too long and she backs away. I'd have loved it if he'd been able to say something to the girl to make her stop and think before she did something that would get him hurt.|0
"Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film ""A Death in Venice. "" Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition."|1
"""Tart"" is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"". Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that ends up someplace else. ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer."|1
From the film 's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn , in New York - we are back at last with another new film in this season of the BBC period drama. And it features none other than Keira Knightley in her first starring role in this series. Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet in the BBC's period drama A Game of Thrones, set to begin filming in the spring of 2011. The first episode of the series, due for broadcast in Spring 2010, is due to begin airing in the autumn of this year on the channel.|0
I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur . Her bugging her and trying to get answers. That’s not acting. There are many ways for an actress to behave as an actor does. She may show more emotion, more concern, more fear, more vulnerability. But she may also be just being herself. And if she is acting, that is what people think she is doing. So if there is an acting quality in Jean Arthur’s behaviour, she is not necessarily acting.|0

I am not sure if anyone has watched this but it is something to look for in terms of movies that actually make you scared... I actually really enjoy these type of movies but I think that I am still in the ""don't do this in public"" stage with these type of films..."|0

I hate spoilers. This is a movie I would gladly watch knowing every damn thing about it. I know that I'm the only one that would and so that's it for me. This is one of the hardest movies I have ever watched, the first time watching it I had such high expectations, and now I'm thinking that I'll have to rewind to the beginning just to enjoy the movie and understand what went on in the movie before this."|0
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that bad, which I felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very Bad. There were songs & songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown Germans speaking English which is so rubbish. Germans does not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have gave some money to her) In the promo they have shown prepare for Laughing riot.|1
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners, and as the first director of the original “Superman, Batman & Robin” TV series that premiered on CBS in 1952: If the first three Supermen ever appeared on screen (Clark Kent, Hal Jordan, and Jor-El) the last one was in the early 1950s. It’s a sad fact of history that the earliest Superman movie to ever come off the screen was Superman and the Mole (1941).|0
"It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. Bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. He was quietly moving in the TV movie ""Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus"" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed ""The Indian Runner"".In ""The Evil That Men Do"", however, Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns."|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style , because there 's absolutely no substance . I would never watch this movie if I didn't love the story . I am a woman who loves to dress up in sexy outfits . And now I 'm in love with the beauty of a beautiful man , who 's not an actor . I want to make his life full of good food , beautiful women , good songs and lots of fun . Now I know it sounds easy , but that's all I got , I need that .|0
"Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country, which is always the Northern part. If black people were shown this way, there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons.This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the ""clever"" farce clichés. But it's mostly tiresome. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudice.Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality. This is not funny."|1
"This is a great little movie , full of interesting characters and situations . While not in the same class as the classics such as ""The Sting "" or ""The Dirty Dozen"", this movie is a solid entry point. It also does a great job in portraying the human character in all it's glory . Overall a very entertaining movie and worth seeing . I think it would make a good addition to the DVD shelf if you don't own a VHS. The audio quality is pretty good but the video is a little choppy on the DVD version."|0
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast . The quality of the camera work makes for a well made and disturbing film . The use of close ups makes this film to be a good horror film . The story is a bit hard to follow with the fact that it is a true story that is very well told . I give this film 5 out of 5. This film is really well made and the performances were good for a horror film . I give this film 4 out of 5. I have been really enjoying all the Horror films I have been able to see this year .|0
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack , their choices and viewpoints, their emotions. I’d say that Tru and Jack each have one side to them, and no other. But they don’t have other points of view, they have very few. I have one or two, but I don’t want them to get too attached, because I don’t know their future. They can only be so strong. And then they’re gone. And sometimes that happens, but not often.|0
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. We're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.The budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.This film was just so bad. There is nothing in the film even worth watching. The very fact I watched this all the way through stunned me.|1
"I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew ""stoners."" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two."|1
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.|1
First of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.But, I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion.|1
Imagine if you will : four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in a remote, haunted forest of a city. Each of them will have to solve a puzzle to be allowed in the building. In the end each will receive a reward, but each of them will have to solve the mystery in the most difficult way, and will have to be able to get inside the haunted house and open the hidden door to reveal a mystery. In the end will be a lot more than a simple mystery, because the mystery has to be found and unlocked by each of them.|0
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last weekend. It was an interesting film with a lot of characterisation and drama. The only thing I disagree with in the end was the ending (which I will go into in a minute). I would have liked to see it go deeper and develop the story a little more, but unfortunately I wasn't able to see it last night. I'm still a little sad about how it ended, though, because I had such a great time watching it and so many people really liked it.|0
25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have been a fan of his since the 1950's. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me quite a bit. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery.|1
In my analysis of `` Trois couleurs : Blanc '' I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the work's predecessors. In fact it is quite different. In fact, I thought that it is closer to the work of Jean-Paul Rée, who wrote at a time when the subject had been taken up more seriously. But it seems that I was wrong, for this book is definitely closer to the work of René Roussel (1909 - 1973) than it is to that of René Lefèvre (1912 - 1991).|0
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great.|1
"Deepa Mehta's ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative, upper middle class Indian households, this is a film no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together, they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support."|1
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact , it 's so nerve-wracking , I have no idea how much I will fall asleep. There are three scenes that I can only describe with the word 'horror' . I was in awe. I thought it was so amazing that I would cry , but it was no big thing . It starts on the last day before Christmas. My husband and I have planned this for a year and a half , because we really love eachother , and we can't wait until we see eachother on Christmas morning.|0
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . Generic and boring , there’s not much that you can do there . You have to create an original story in order to be successful . You don’t get sequels and you can’t make comedies because there’s nothing that can make it more enjoyable . There’s nothing that will give you a bit more of what you love about the genre . If you’re going to make a remake , it has to follow the original story line , the same story and the same characters .|0
"The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, ""Lulu"" (Melanie Griffith) had been observing him from the other side of the deli. ""Lulu"" is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page-boy cut."|1
"I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. This The Fantastic Four film, complete with the I-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue ""Kill him!...Let him go!"" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides."|1
I unwittingly walked into this `` trap '' of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a new phone and put a new screen on it, I would have made the same mistake.As I write this I have been asked to write my story, but I do not know anything about it. If it were to happen, the results would be the same, I know that now.The movie was supposed to be a story about the life of my mother, but it was basically about my dad. The director had to cut a lot of dialogue, so my mom would never learn what was said about her.|0
OK , Number one-this `` film '' is a `` 90 's '' version of a crappy show from the mid-'80s. I'm not gonna lie - this is kind of like a 90's remake of that same thing...sort of. The show was a bit of a flop because the writers were just plain lazy and they couldn't decide whether to keep it real or fake for the audience. I was watching it with my dad in the early '90's - we had a VHS tape. It wasn't really that great of a show but it was decent enough.|0
I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch.|1
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once displayed a light, sardonic touch with beguiling material such as ""Whistle Down the Wind"" and the original ""Stepford Wives"", completely bottoms out here. Not only is his direction inept, he also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the scenery, is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script."|1
At first I didn't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by Lauren Ambrose.Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts.|1
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie begins. Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is Sarandon.|1
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care?|1
i do n't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from its acting to its production values to its visuals.this is the worst thing ever.its so bad it is laughable.i have never seen anything in my life that looked and acted like this.i am sure you will never watch this movie again.i urge you to boycott this film.this is a waste of time that you will not get and will only make you want to get better. I saw the movie in theaters and I am appalled at all the grossness.|0
it 's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is , but I just think we need to just accept what we can and can not do on a personal level , but we don't see anything that would make me think otherwise . I really don't want to put words in anyone's mouth , but it seems as though they want to think this way is a good thing . The only difference is that if the people who do this think this is good , then they'll take action .|0
"( Contains really bad Spoilers ) So what can I say about this .... It 's a really HORRIBLE and SAD SONG. Its pretty sad and sad I tell you what. But hey it 's all you can say at this point I guess, and it will probably make more sense when the story finally ends. ( I'm not quite sure how well it 'll be done )

So this is the story of how I ended up being a very bad boy .... I came to this blog to vent and rant on all the things that I thought were wrong with me .... And I found this."|0
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs , watermellons , people , etc . They would kill a chicken if they got too close to an area where it's food source . Here are some of the things you might find inside a house . It's very likely you'll find a dead or dying cat on the ground where you live . You might find a dead cat ( or any animal ) in your garden . We've seen dead birds and snakes in gardens in the UK and I've also seen frogs in my own back garden .|0
I logged on here right after watching this movie , feeling that it was so awful that at least its plot was believable , I guess that is the last thing to do. But this review is a bit different from all these others because it is the kind of review that can be used as evidence in court. And it is not an opinion. It is the truth. For all those people that watched this movie and said that they didn't like it or that they didn't think that it was worth seeing, please, please, please, please, read the review.|0
"This isn't ""so bad it's good""--It's ""so bad, it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment""! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even figure out the ""plot"" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" is like saying that ""Gigli"" is like ""Citizen Kane""."|1
Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction.|1
Though it 's better than most made-for-TV movies , `` Buried Alive '' is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge thriller and not much more. The best thing about it, is how well it handles the characters in it, they are all pretty well cast and all are funny in their own different ways. And there is one great twist in this one. You know how when you get to a place where you are trying to solve a crime and you are faced with a dead body you can see the solution in the body ?|0
The Toxic Avenger, Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'.|1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had 350,000 dollars to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie....Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this movie....To small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better.|1
"This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink ""I Never Got to Say Goodbye"", is the song come to life. You will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing."|1
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three. )Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story. )No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here.|1
In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris' cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.|1
I watched this movie and all I can say is this...I am not a film student, nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don't understand. However, IF I were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...Yep! He's on drugs and I can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly?|1
"Even if you 're not a `` theatre person , '' I highly recommend that you see this . Based upon the play and film, it 's a very moving and moving experience . I would have given it 4/5 stars .

"" I was a big fan of the book in the beginning. It was great to see it adapted to the stage. The acting was so good and I didn't think it was that bad . I thought it was so funny and it was so well written. This was my first time watching the musical and I was really amazed."|0
I can only think of one reason this movie was released. To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn's memory. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this utter trash. Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.|1
Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! !Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know?|1
"SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! ! This was my son 's review of the movie , which he wanted me to share with all of you here and there, because it is really good and I wanted to share it to you guys. So I thought why not start with a spoiler alert ? :)

This is another movie that is full of comedy and action and it is a fun watch and I'm really glad I saw it , and I really recommend to everyone who wants to have fun with this movie. The movie begins with a car accident where two teenagers have crashed at a local church."|0
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey ' . Endless nature footage, lush cinematography, stunning locations and a fantastic cast all help to create an awesome movie. I have not seen this movie before but i will definitely be going and checking it out again. I am so excited for the new movie! I think it has it all. If you haven't caught it yet, I highly recommend doing so now. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I am giving the new Prey movie a 7 out of 10.|0
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr. ).|1
Countenance ! Antoine Monot , in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith 's Silent Bob , keeps asking for it. Why does he do this? It’s the question on every writer’s lips, the one they’ve always wanted to know the answer to. So, the man has decided to put his money where his mouth is by setting this up, so to speak. But why is that, exactly? The answer, as you’re reading this article, is in the title, of course.|0
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry , like the first time I saw this movie . Not sure if it's the film itself but I can't watch it anymore . I can't watch anything else because I'm afraid I won't see the end of the end . Not that I don't care to watch this movie now and then but I've never felt this way after watching this movie . I don't get it either but I don't really care either way . Maybe I am just not capable of understanding what it's about so maybe I won't like it .|0
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki- bashing in the film, this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki- bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music.|1
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better."|1
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both under the impression that it was one of the classics of the genre and we did not believe that it was that bad.We didn't come away with an impression of any of the characters though, they really did nothing much. I would have liked the film to have lasted a bit longer as I think that the first hour was quite slow. I'm not even sure if the second hour is as good as the first, and I suspect that the third hour is not very good at all.|0
Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi , this film does not feel quite as much like an adventure as the title might imply. That’s really the worst thing about it; the adventure is all around us. The film takes place during the Italian resistance to the Nazi war machine, which took place from July 1940 to May 1941. The story unfolds in a number of different locations. The first thing we need to note is the presence of a significant number of people. We do not see the bulk of them.|0
"Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's bad enough I wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time I lost that I could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually lost a few IQ points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing ""work""! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time."|1
Ice the Limerick:A virus pulled out of the iceJust didn't know how to play nice.If infected you'll killBecause you are ill.The cure is to be infected twice.Ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other.|1
Seriously I do n't get why people are all like `` Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!``. I mean this is a big budget film and you get a lot of plot lines going, so it doesn't sound like much but you get to see a lot of characters interact with each other and I think you have to give yourself some leeway, I mean it is a good thing to see what people go through, it's not really that big a deal to go and see a couple of movies.|0
My first post at the IMDb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. It doesn't make any sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. I could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rental.|1
This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget film) is much better . I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film. THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing.|1
The plot for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the Phillipines. One Black, and one White. These two women, are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the Phillipines and assume a better life.|1
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians, which essentially all there is to this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed.|1
I do n't leave IMDb comments about films but this .... this film was bad . very bad . I have watched it again and again with a new set of eyes , and will never watch it again . Don't go to the cinema , just go out and buy a DVD and watch it on the video on your TV ... and if you dont like it , then go somewhere else ... and if you do like the movie , i suggest you go to your nearest DVD rental store . I just don't understand why people like this movie so much.|0
Having watched this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for Goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. While I do understand that Mr. Forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, I was left feeling that there was just so much of Goya left out, so much of his humanity.|1
A lot of 'alternative ' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular , misguided , overly-political , and unfunny. In this episode I'm going to talk about that. I'm going to discuss a lot of the funny, silly, awkward things that were said and done during my youth in British comedy. A lot of the comedy that I saw in the 80s, especially in the late 80s and into the 90s was in a very narrow field. There was a very specific niche of British comedy that was very niche indeed. The British comedy scene in the 80s was very narrow.|0
I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints , one of the most brutal games in all of gaming history. But I’m glad I didn’t go out and buy the DVD because I know that the film will be the one and only part of the film that will leave me wondering. I don’t see what the big deal is. People do this sort of thing in movies all the time just to shock the crap out of the audience, and they don’t get away with it as much in video games.|0
Now, I like the Bollywood films and I'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish.The idea of a modern-Bollywood take on Amadeus was quite an exciting one, that is until the two supposed 'musicians' appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man, and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities, but he is never once believable as a modern Mozart.|1
This is the worst movie I have seen to date . 85 minutes of utterly bad acting , ( half of which is played by a woman ) and sub par story , nothing that really made sense to me , ( like the idea that someone is going to kill you in an alley , and it has to take a man to get your money ) so i was kinda hoping for some kind of twist or surprise like in the second Xmen , but no it only plays like its going to be an awesome movie , which is a bit of a bad thing .|0
This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It is very danish and the characters are very real. It is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It is really about love that has no gender. I would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story about love and life.The story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense.|1
A genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, its imaginative and genuinely gripping, but at the end its almost like Oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a rapid ending.The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together. But their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness.|1
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. They sound like today's stats).|1
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I guess I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes.These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick?|1
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this book (and movie) deal with the issue of sexual identity and how they try to fit into the community. I can relate to much of it and it's a bit depressing. But, I do agree with you, that this is the first time that such a large portion of society (and the world as a whole) are put under the illusion that these teens are the same as us, when they are not.|0
"Nothing about this movie is any good. It's a formulaic predictable ""romantic comedy"" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. In other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors."|1
After watching this film , I thought to myself , they really glossed up Errol Flynn 's life ! The movie seems to show that Errol Flynn had his good points and there are other good reasons for him, but for me it looks like the film does not know what the real reason was for him. They made him look good, but Errol Flynn was real and a man and not a movie star. It's not fair. This film really is a movie for kids , but at times it just does not do Errol Flynn justice.|0
"The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata""(1978) starring Ingrid Bergman,Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson.It did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.It is time Film journalists like Khalid Mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. It makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of Hollywood and European films.You've got to give the film-maker something though. The film he picked for copying is one of Bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in European cinema."|1
"Was excited at the opening to hear part of ""Chevaliers De Sangreal"" but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks?"|1
This version of `` The Magic Flute '' is not only the worst production of Mozart 's great opera that has ever taken the stage, it's also the last one. In fact, the very last performance of Mozart's great work is not even the very last performance of his last opera. What happens to the piece, as we are about to find out, is just as important as the opera itself. The composer, Mozart, died of pneumonia in April 1780, just a little more than four months before the curtain went up on the curtain raiser to the final act.|0
After just viewing the movie, I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film?|1
"I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about ""Dinosaurs eat people."" However, it was disappointing even on that level.For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly ""enough"" dinosaurs."|1
This film was really terrible.However , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed at that for a long time.There were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that I found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end.|1
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.As a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor.|1
"I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. There is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler ' at the Toronto Film Festival this year . While the other reviews made it pretty clear that I was not interested in it, they were a bit more nuanced. After a while, they started talking about the characters, the story, the art direction, the cast and the production design, and all of those aspects started to click. It was a revelation for me as a filmmaker to realize that the story, the art direction, the cinematography, the music, the acting, everything, is completely and totally made by a group of people of color.|0
'The Mill on the Floss ' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans , who wrote under the name Mary Ann M. Jones in her early years. It describes the lives of three women who live in a small isolated house in the Lake District. Its heroine, Mary, is the housemaid. Mary lives in constant fear that the landlord, who is a neighbour, would come round and force her to go to the lavatory. Mary is constantly worried that the landlord and his son would come round and murder her as they did so often during the early part of the book.|0
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible.|1
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [ # 4/10 ] , with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some interesting character development from the very beginning. This was a fun book to write and I am looking forward to this series to come! A very odd entry in this series. The photography was quite good, with a nice atmosphere, but nothing really stood out to me, and I didn't get much to like about the characterisation, except that it seemed the Doctor was becoming a better and a stronger character as the storyline progressed.|0
"I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a girl's life. That's all I need to know. But what the hell is Morris' style? This is my first time hearing Morris' style, so if I'm pronouncing anything incorrectly, I apologize in advance. Here goes nothing:

He does a lot of different stuff:

* A lot of long, drawn-out movies. * A big chunk of music, most notably music from the 50s, 60s and 70s."|0
I 've never written a comment on IMDb before , but this movie was so bad it left me little hope of ever seeing it again . Not even worth seeing the trailer on IMDb , it’s not even on there. The movie was bad , I would not recommend it , I was so disappointed I left the theater before it was over . If you are at all concerned about quality, it’s worth noting that the DVD was made from the Blu-ray version and has all the same content on the disc as the one I saw.|0
"I'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and I love this movie.It's no ""Mystic River."" It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he's good in this. So are Julianne Nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!"|1
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination or the events leading up to it. But it was not. This fictionalized film, like many others, was created with the intent to make it appear more “real” than it actually was. If the people creating the fake film knew any facts, there would not have been any need for the fake film. But if we go back to the original movie theater, we find there was no room to sit there and watch anything but the film as the movie itself was playing.|0
There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty.|1
"Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight."|1
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.|1
Strange , often effective hippie zombie flick , starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby , this is a film that can not be missed . It’s a great way to relax and have a good time . If you love a good laugh, you’ve probably seen this film before , or you will in the near future . A zombie movie is not just a film with zombies , it’s about zombies , that’s it . This movie has zombies , all the time , all the time , all the time , all the time , and this is why .|0
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in Paris and forget it's Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft.|1
"Forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? A dial up internetconnection? Clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures (""He!"|1
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos . It is probably the first thing that popped into a viewer's mind when they saw the opening credits of this wonderful movie . This is an excellent little documentary about the whole process by a group of German filmmakers and cameramen . It goes in depth into the origins, development, etc of the production and editing of the movie and shows that some of the best German documentary films in history are based on just one of the most difficult and complex filmic techniques ever used to produce a documentary .|0
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite storyline. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies.|1
"And one of 'em are bad movies . The title , as it turns out , refers to a killer in one of 'em who was in one of 'em. Not sure if he was real or fictional. :D

I watched it yesterday and it got me excited. There are so many parts you can laugh out loud in this film. I liked that there was a bit of satire in the story. That's how movies can do satire and have some real emotion in them (as long as you don't laugh out loud)."|0
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as the ones I want to tell here. There are many, many more films which could tell their story better, as there were so many of them back then, but I am not going to write about them here. I do not have the time and am not willing to spend the hours to find them. I am, however, going to write this review to show how I feel this film compares with others I have seen and why I like it the most.|0
I enjoyed it . There you go , I said it again . I even bought this movie on DVD and have it on dvd . And I was so glad when I watched this on the dvd , because it took me like 2 hours because of all the sex scenes , all the violence and everything else . It was so hot , so intense and so much fun ! I thought this movie was about a guy who has been locked up in a mental hospital for the past 15 years and was able to pull some strings with the help of his family and friends to escape.|0
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular . The cast is like the saved by the bell kind of characters. They are all the same and we see their back story that is all about how they ended up in prison. I really thought that was the whole story of the movie but they didn’t give us anything new to say. They just rehash what was already said for the first 2 hours. I mean if you have to ask what the story is then why are you even watching the movie.|0
"The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only ""star power"" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. Someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin."|1
"I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway in 1980. It starred George Hearn and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production, which was videotaped for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original tape's age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly pressed DVD."|1
This movie is funny in more ways than one . It 's got action . It 's got humour . It ' s got a great story . It has a terrific score . But it's not as good a movie as its trailer suggests . The trailer, of course , doesn't help matters . The best movie is the movie . I saw it last night and found it to be an absolute riot. It has some very funny moments in the middle . Some very good moments in the end . But it 's got some pretty bad scenes in it .|0
For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema.|1
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice surprise on Friday. The show was on the CW. This was the first episode of Arrow, a show that I've only just recently seen, and one that has never been on my list of favorite shows, let alone one that I've read or even reviewed. The show is written and directed by the talented David Nutter, who's also the creator, executive producer and show runner of such TV hits as The Walking Dead and the critically acclaimed The Americans.|0
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity.|1
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever . There is no spoken dialogue , no music and there is literally not a single image . I don't know whether this was done as a joke or for the purpose of it being a horror movie or a horror film , or if it has been planned from the very beginning , but if you have been living on this planet for any amount of time , you know it's a stupid movie , and I'm not going to explain it to you . The movie starts with three guys in black suits carrying a coffin through the woods.|0
OK , this movie was n't good at all . Video games are n't what I would brag on if I wnt to play, and when I want to play a video games , it n't easy to play them . what happened with this movie , is it is good ? No . at the beginning , it has n't so much to offer . I do n't wnt to watch the entire movie , so if you are interested in it , i'll wait for you , but if you are bored with this movie , I do n't recommend to see this movie .|0
8/2008 . When I originally wrote my comments , shortly after first seeing this film , I took a critical view on it. It seemed like a typical horror film that was not very good. However, after seeing it again, it’s actually a great film. The only thing I really hated about the movie is the editing which I feel makes it look like a horror movie and it made the whole movie less effective than it already was. This is a very interesting concept and I hope that the director will come back to try and improve on it or even make it a horror/thriller movie again.|0
Dodgy plot , dodgy script , dodgy almost everything in fact . The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Lumley as Eloise. She’s brilliant. The way she walks up the stairs to her brother’s room. The way she carries herself. I have no idea where she was born but this was the best version of her I have ever seen. It was all very well done . She has an incredible voice, she sings with real conviction and you feel that the story is as important as her voice. And the way she carries herself on the stage is very convincing.|0
This is an astonishingly bad action film. I'd say its primary flaw is that it's BORING. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set design, and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. Mod Squad's second (major) flaw is its lack of character development--underscored by the actors' lack of talent. I tend to like Claire Danes's work so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully miscast: how could his cotton-mouthed, bumbling acting style possibly fit into an ACTION flick?|1
"Really ? Is this necessary ? How can somebody make such a film ? Disgusting ! ! ! Seteven Seagal , a great director, can't do this, can't be an actor in a film like this. It's a shame. I thought I was doing the right thing and that I should just put the trailer up. I didn't know how wrong I was. This is disgusting. This isn't a film by a ""great director"", this is a film with a trailer and without a film."|0
There 's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon 's `` Robe d'Ete '' . It 's surprising how much time it 's taking to do this. But don 't be misled. There is no boring moment, it 's just you, me, and the robot. This isn't a bad game, really. The player has a chance to build up their own character, a good one, if you will. There 's not a bad guy in there, just people and things you can use your robot to kill.|0
This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately!|1
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here . but I really did not find this movie worth the money . the script by kim jong-soo was good , but the story , plot , acting , and acting in general is really bad . the acting in this film , and the music was good , but the plot , acting and acting in this film , is horrible . and as far as I can tell , not one line of the film is original . what happened was , this film was made based on an old novel . but it did not look good at all .|0
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films , only one was released by a director he admired. In that movie, he was inspired by his father, a veteran of World War 2 who had served in the Royal Australian Air Force during the war. Charles was born on July 20, 1939, and was the second of three sons. He had an older sister. Charles was born in Perth, Western Australia, and was brought up in an Anglican home, attended public schools and was an altar-boy in a small Perth parish church.|0
Now out of all the shark movies I 've seen , this one takes the cake ! The plot of the story is simple enough. There is a shark out there that is killing people ! There is no reason why he needs to do this , the sharks nature is such that they are perfectly capable of avoiding the problem that is killing them . But when he gets the chance he decides to take advantage of the situation and try to kill a human ! He then decides to come after other humans as well , and that is where the problem comes in .|0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie . What is even more stupid is that they make it so you can buy a movie that is not in the movie rental store. That is their fault, but they have no excuse for not giving a copy of the film to the movie theater that has been showing it for years. As for me I didn't care if the movie was not in the theater. I don't even think I would buy it if it was on VHS. I am going to watch it in the theater.|0
"This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these ""super human"" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies!"|1
When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché . With character names like “The Stalker” or “The Beast”, they are the standard biker trope of a bad guy with a “beastly” voice and bad intentions . Yet, that movie is actually a very interesting and enjoyable film that shows an alternate, more realistic version of the “beastly” biker stereotype. With that said, it can be difficult to see the difference between the fictional version of the beast and a “real” one in the real world, or even a “real” biker stereotype.|0
I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film . Just not believable in the role . Barbara Eden as the mother was also a poor choice. I mean Pidgeon does a good job of acting his part, but I think this is the first time a woman in that role has ever played in a film. So I will take it as the director intended. I don't think a woman can act in a part of the film that requires that much muscle. I do agree, Barbara Eden is a poor choice for that part. And the mother is a poor choice.|0
This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. However, with the aid of a pair of cats and the arrival of his grandmother, it ends with the boy walking out of the situation alive and uninjured. This is not the first time that a film has tried to tell the truth about what it was like in the aftermath of natural disasters. But for many of today’s audiences, these are the last films made about the people caught in natural disasters, the ones that are still left behind.|0
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman 's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. The fact that she's a journalist, on top of the fact that the director is the wife of the star of one of her most critically acclaimed films, should tell us that we don't have to worry about her being involved in the making of her film. The film, which also stars John Turturro, also includes some of the film's biggest stars of the '80s and '90s, including Cate Blanchett, Paul Bettany and Robert De Niro.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished stuntman. As I recall, he was featured in many of the early '80s films and shows. He's been on TV for years. His work in the past few years, though, hasn't been nearly as well known, if at all. I remember that he was also one of my favorites. He was also in a great movie a couple of years ago in which I don't know the title. He played the part of one of the gangsters and he had a great face.|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared being oddly camp. Raised many laughs but also many yawns. don't watch with anyone, anytime any place. If u hate someone, recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant...not. i cant think of anything else to say except Don't ever see this movie, it will make u want to jump off a cliff.|1
I absolutely hated this movie . Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message , it didn’t come through for me . You see , this movie was made before the social media age . There are all these social networks out there and the people on them are supposed to be able to “share” what they are seeing . But in a movie like this , you have to have some kind of reason for people to want to share it with you . What the hell kind of movie was this supposed to be about ? .|0
I 'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70 's and early 80 's and John Mahoney was the main star. I thought the episodes were pretty funny and I was just a fan. So when I heard there was a new SCTV revival on DVD I knew I would love this collection. I have been collecting SCTV DVDs ever since the show ran. They are all in nice packaging with nice artwork. A few shows have been reissued. I have a collection of the new DVDs and they are in nice packaging too.|0
"I unwittingly walked into this ""trap"" of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a refund I would be happy.It was 7:30pm and Cinderella Man didn't start until 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and I dare say God reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing."|1
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb, Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller.|1
"Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. Some scenes are not ""nice"" or ""beautiful"", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what's happening here. The camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst."|1
There is something that one of the characters ( the aging film director who pretends to be dead ) says on the show and the viewer thinks, what is this thing that the character is saying? And then I think, what is the character talking about? A bit further down the rabbit hole it leads me to another rabbit hole and I can’t remember where the rabbit hole leads me to! But I think I will just keep going. So let’s do some digging and let’s get lost in this rabbit hole for a little bit.|0
I won't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, Derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother.|1
"There are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind ""The Ransom Of Red Chief""! Even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler."|1
This is an interesting movie . I think it 's very humorous , although the humor is very black . But I like it because it's good to see a different side of life . This is one of the most well done movies of this year . I think it does not need to be seen as a kid or young person , but as a grown-up . I really enjoyed the movie . I like the way it looks , I like the message it has for people , and I think it should be a very important movie .|0
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after the other are taken for granted, to the point that they’re not even noted in the film’s narrative, which is one of several reasons this book was written: to be honest I really wasn’t too interested in the idea of Flynn licking stamps for the first twenty years or so of his life, after all he’d probably been a stamp collector since his first stamp came in!|0
Oh yes , I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash . I have read every word of this review and I know exactly what the review writer was saying . It is true that this book is very well done . I have enjoyed it from the beginning to the end . It is the way a book is supposed to be , with a strong plot line , it doesn't have to be the most original way , but to be able to make it interesting and to be entertaining . This story was a great plot line , which was the best for me .|0
The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not , admittedly , all that original . Young lovers are forced to fly away together to save their own lives . When one of the young men is fatally injured in the crash he is rescued by his beloved, but she is killed in the crash . After this, the young lovers are forced to travel on an island in the middle of nowhere to make a new start together . Now, they are facing a series of obstacles, but they have an alternative plan . They will take turns flying on the same boat .|0
Don ` t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME LAPSE. It’s not a remake at all! I believe the movie was actually directed by James Newton Howard, who directed many classic horror films including NIGHT OF THE COWLINGHAM COW BOY, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and COLD BLOOD. I don’t remember any of these films coming out in ’94, except the first two. The new film has no connection with the first two or the third ones.|0
i was a huge fan of this series. Yesterday i watched it again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} & Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. This series shows what good, clean comedy is.If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10.|1
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust . Well , parts of the Earth , because somewhere in Italy , millions of people are now starving to death for want of food and water . This was the point at which most people on earth died of starvation . For a long time , no-one really wanted to take responsibility of the problem, because then they would lose their power, but it is so obvious that the world would have no alternative but to solve the problem. After all , there are millions of years left to do the job.|0
"Though I have watched Salò, I do not know if excrement tastes tart. If it does, this ""film"" is accurately titled. So much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense I would. Detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure."|1
This gem captures early 80 's life brilliantly . As a grad '83 boymyself , I must say that Valley Forge is very different to what I remember from High School (I've been a grad for over 20 years, so I must have missed a lot by now!) Valley Forge was really quite a unique place to go. I really like how it has grown over the years. I do remember being at school on the weekends ,and it was a different place then . I loved that I got to explore my neighborhood and make some friends.|0
This movie , with all its complexity and subtlety , makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I’ve ever seen. Not to mention, for some reason the film manages to stay on the cutting-edge of this generation of cinema. There’s even a music video made for this. So what’s the big deal? Why is the film so good, and why do I feel so strongly that we should all buy it? 1. There’s a reason that a lot of the greatest movies of the modern age were made in Europe.|0
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward.|1
Well I guess I know the answer to that question . For the MONEY ! We have been so bombarded by the media that we don’t even have a clue how we got there ! If it wasn’t for you guys and the great work you are doing, we would NOT have been in the position we would be today and that is why I am in so much trouble for doing this interview ! I just feel it is a very good thing that you guys have helped us achieve our goals so far !|0
This is , per se , an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made for the masses in the first place? There is NO reason why the film was made. It’s not like they thought it would be made into a full length feature or anything. No they made it into a short film to try and get it into the movie market. Also it was a low budget picture. And it got made in a time where no studio would touch a film unless it was a big budget production.|0
Strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. Includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. Wife Anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. There are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any Al Adamson flic), but it's no Night of the Living Dead.|1
I would not recommend it whatsoever. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except The two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did smack of Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers.|1
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a while . The acting was just soooo bad. I would hate to meet any of the people that wrote this movie. The story was just so depressing. It had me in the theater from beginning to end. I think I lost $150 to $300 for this movie. I could have done worse. I have a feeling this is going to become a big hit with people, I think the director is going to have an impact on Hollywood movies for years to come.|0
Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure film, that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing, poor characterisation and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he comes face-to-face with the Devil's Reaper  a demon who collects the Devil's debts i.e. souls  refusing to go to hell just yet, he evades the Reaper and starts a new life in an English monastery.|1
When the Legends Die is a powerful , moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become a hero fighting for his rights. “I love the Legends Die because, when I started it, it was just a game and it grew into something more,” said Jason, who is 22 years old at the time of the game’s initial release last September, but is now 23 years old. “I started playing this because it’s just such a great idea. The game has come a long way and I want to continue this story.|0
"I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got. The acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the ""sand map"". It was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic."|1
What can I say about this movie , it really is one of the worst gay themed movies , ever . I hate the idea of it . But i guess this is the only gay movie that i will watch , so its worth it to me . There was a film i saw about 6 years ago called The Gay Movie . It was very bad . Anyway , i saw this movie when i was in university . I had seen this movie before it was released . There was a poster in the film that told you which movie was the first gay movie .|0
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...In this case, I guess it doesn't matter that much. The third Underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. They had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in.|1
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally beautiful script, written and acted by one of the greatest of all the “new” young playwrights. I’m always impressed by Emilio’s talent, he has a knack for writing strong, complex characters that never seem to go out of control. He also has a great eye for characterizations and his ability to make a simple story a work of entertainment. This is a fantastic film and I’m looking forward to seeing more Emilio Estevez in theaters.|0
"Ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...This one stars Jaqueline Lovell(sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in ""Femalien"", ""The Erotic House of Wax"", and that family favorite ""Nude Bowling Party"". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. ""Head of the Family"" actually tries to be a real moovie. A con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed."|1
"What ever happened to shows with united parental figures? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they're ""cute."" This show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the ""divide and conquer"" technique is the best way to get their parents to ""cave."""|1
As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood . In the scene where the dog grabs the hand of the professor and asks him to give her the money she asks him to give her the paper he is holding. That's all we get. That's what we see of the whole movie. It is not shown what happens with the money. You will never get an answer about this. What we do see is the dog licking the hand that has been put in his hands. It's just a simple kiss.|0
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!! !the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props.|1
A very , very , very slow-moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man . Not sure if it has any meaning for you , or if it has meaning at all , I’ll have to wait till the DVD arrives to judge that . You see , this is a film that was directed by Paul Greengrass , so it will definitely have meaning for him . This film is set in the year 2025 , and it stars the late great , great , great , George Clooney and his wife Christy Turlington ( one of my all-time favorite actresses ! ) .|0
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty.|1
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining ( which is n't available at Troma) but I saw it was made in Germany. I also saw the cover art as well as the poster. I liked it. The story was great and the special effects were very effective as well as it being a sequel. I would definitely re-watch this film and I am pretty sure I might watch it again but not like the movie I just saw, it would be a bit too long. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in the story.|0
I 'm sorry , but I can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought it was! They were smoking the product, which is a carcinogen! I guess that people should be more serious about what they are smoking. And I agree with you that the tobacco industry should put a price on their product (which they have not). They are making money from the smokers, but the people who think that the product is good, are the ones who are ruining the lives of so many people out there, and this is not helping them.|0
Wow , I was told this would be a B movie worth watching . I feel that I was misled . I do not wish to say that it is bad . I did not want to give spoilers , I only want to make it clear what I thought of the film . This is the movie I wanted to see from the start and it is one I will always look back on . I do have some minor gripes and complaints about the movie , though . One is the ending . While I can understand not getting the last act finished , the movie seemed rushed and unfocused , like it was lacking something .|0
At the time of this writing ( January 25 , 2006 ) , I am saddened to hear of the passing of my friend Michael. A true champion for the community and a good friend to many. A person I will always be proud of for his integrity, service to his community, dedication to his family, and service to his God. I will miss him very much. I am sorry to see his passing, but also proud to see him lead the way for many of the good, hardworking men & women who served our great nation.|0
"I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially ""Uncle Benny"". I thought that Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. The story line definitely kept your interest and I hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. I felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say I didn't see it coming."|1
Young , ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee ( Rosie Holotik ) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the countryside. While there she falls in with a group of patients who are looking for their missing mother. Ms. Charlote quickly finds herself involved with the group and she finds herself drawn into their world , finding herself struggling to fit in . One of the patients is Ms. Charlote's fellow nurse , who she finds to be a bit more of a nuisance . She soon starts to fall for the patient , only to find herself pushed to her limits as she struggles with the patient and the group .|0
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play . The story is full of holes and there was no explanation for any of it. I could have watched that show for weeks in a row. It was so confusing. I feel you. I've seen all of those movies. I still don't get the ending. And when I think about what they were talking about, I realize I can't wrap my head around them either. It is one of the things I hate about sci-fi. There are so many mysteries that have no explanation.|0
The film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere -- at least in India , and it may have happened many times in the past in many parts of the world. But it's interesting to have a film that covers a wide spectrum of subjects, that is not simply an attack on India, or an Indian movie. I think that it does make some good points about the nature of our society. The movie has some great actors, and a great director, who makes sure that there is a lot of energy in every single shot.|0
no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the IMDB comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script IS terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace.|1
Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like `` The Avengers '' and the remake of `` Diabolique '' are teaming with director Michael Bay and actor Tom Hardy to bring you ``Saw 3D ». The three-part series also stars Bruce Willis. The movie is scheduled to be released this fall. ``I've got the team and I know the rules, so I'm going to try to break them all,'' said Bay. ``This is the biggest project I've ever been involved with. It's a big commitment, a big challenge.|0
"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) portrayal of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been ""created"" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself."|1
`` Lets swap Murders- your wife , my father '' - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony Murders in the heart of the American suburbs where he was found. Murders was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs and has lived in various parts of the United States and Canada . He was born to a middle class family of Italian descent . His parents moved the family from Illinois to California , where they grew up , and were later sent to live in Wisconsin . Murders has two sisters and a sister who is married to a police officer .|0
I like Steve Buscemi . I like his work very much , both as an actor and a director . I’m not going to be able to afford his movies , but those who are can go see his movies . They’re worth seeing . I’d much rather watch him as a director . But he’s also a wonderful actor . He has an amazing voice . And his work on the TV shows is really amazing . But I don’t have it in me to see the movies. But if I were going to, I’d watch the movies with my friends .|0
I will never , ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 . Even at the young age of 26, I was able to not only watch a show in which my dad had appeared , but also to feel as though I had been a fan of his work all my life! And it was all thanks to my sister, my brother, my brother in law and of course my friends! The show itself was a wonderful experience and one that I hope to go back and watch one day , but this was the first show I watched that was based on my own imagination.|0
Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking Bugs, and some nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious.|1
This episode of Charmed changed everything ! The show is about to end it 's third season , and all the new characters are going to be introduced , which I really like. I also think that this show deserves a 5 star rating just for that . The show started in September , 2010, and finished in December, 2015. There's a lot to read about the story , the characters , the events and even the show itself . We will talk about it later when the new season comes . As you might remember , the main character , Charmed is named Lacy .|0
This is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list.|1
This is an excellent film , but Momento ( Nolan 's other big budget film ) is much better . In fact I saw it as a part time job on the side, but that was a while back , so I don't know who was directing it ! If you like action , it should appeal to those with a healthy appetite for popcorn . I like this, I am glad it's back , but it's not without a few flaws ( not that I have seen all of it ). But it is still a good film and worth the time.|0
Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin? The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I don't know a power plant nearby, some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two.|1
WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!! !Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.1. Never, ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away.|1
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. The script left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara like rip-off of some Saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. Nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. I'm just amazed I found this at a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old VHS movies.|1
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. Rene is FINE!!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone forward me his contact info?My friend thinks Flex is the finer of the two. She's been a Flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. The cousins were funny and just as trifling as Nana described them. LOL.I am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.|1
"This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, ""Rolling Kansas"" is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie."|1
"This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it 's one of the few American films made in Britain, the director was American, and his name is George Stevens. He is credited as screenwriter with the title of ""George M. Stevens"". The film is directed by John Ford (died 1957) and is based on the story of a real person. It is one of those rare films with a British cast. In the film Stevens is the only actor not of British extraction."|0
"If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or stealing it or both…

That was the picture of the last of the Great Pyramids, built for the Pharaoh Ramses III in 1350 BC. The Egyptians used them for all sorts of important purposes ranging from religious rites to power struggles and military campaigns. As you can probably imagine, nobody could agree on just where the two Pyramids were in relation to the city of Giza, which sat atop them. So they were divided up and each got a different name."|0
Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it.|1
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher Graduation Day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.What it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!|1
There's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time.|1
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief , you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they will deliver the goods. It's an interesting way to try and make your life more comfortable without giving them too much trouble. If you're a gamer you don't get too excited about the possibility of these games coming to the platform because you're more interested in the game itself. It just makes you feel like you should be able to play it with a console, so you'll be fine.|0
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French way. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age, full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture).|1
"I rented this type of ""soft core"" before, but I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as ""Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die""--which was both sexy AND funny. It had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason why I didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the ""Must be 18 to Rent"" Sticker. I was looking for more ""cheese"" and less ""cheesecake."|1
"This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring ""looks-like-a-suspens"" scenes.Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of ""hello's"" and few ""hang on"" on the 1st part.Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters."|1
It 's really good to see Van Damme 's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to the previous ones he has made. His film is about a soldier and his love for his ex-wife. The film starts with a man being sent to the hospital for a chest X Ray. His wife tells him that the X Ray revealed that he has cancer. The soldier becomes so depressed. He then meets a girl who is his ex-wife's cousin. Her father, who was in Vietnam, has recently died. The two of them become best friends as the war is coming close.|0
Oh my God ... where to begin ? `` Chupacabra Terror '' is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. It is also one of the most expensive. It is not very well made and has very poor writing and poor effects. It is also not very good horror film. And it is made by a company with a bad reputation for quality of the horror movies. There are several people who have said that they had made the movie and then it became a flop, because of its horrible writing and horrible effects. It seems like that it does not have a good reputation at all.|0
I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that's all I can say...Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazyI cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that's all I can say...Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...p.s.|1
I ca n't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess ! The plot ( and I use this term loosely ) was too complex to have a simple answer ! They had to get to the core of the mess. I mean, look at it with a cold, straight-shooting, cold-case-inspection-and-confirm-thestery-is-there look. But then, why does it take this long? Because it takes time to make it look like something other than the way it is ! And I am not saying that they were careless or that there is something that they couldn't have done, either.|0
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was also their last big screen movie together as Fonda would die only three years later. Fonda would die in February of 1976. Stanwyck would become an active member of the American Film Institute and its Board of Governors after she would pass away in the summer of 1976. And a few years later she would become the first female member of the Academy Awards Committee. In addition to her work in the industry, Stanwyck also became the first person of African ancestry to join the Academy Awards Committee in 1973.|0
So, it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people--eye candy. But that's about it...a string of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy?|1
I think my summary says it all . This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a guy who gets into trouble by lying, breaking and stealing from people. But he doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him that everyone on his street knows who he is. He's the one who has to deal with the consequences of his dishonesty. And it's his honesty that helps him stay on top of the situation. What a guy! I love that they make you lie for them. It makes them feel good.|0
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. The main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. That is the entire movie. I love to see very gory movies, especially since in America real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. So yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. But it just isn't really disturbing.|1
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen . However , it is also one of the best films I have seen. The plot is not as great as many of these films and the actors are not as good as others but the story is still amazing. There is however a slight problem that the ending does not go as you would like and you don’t understand why your friend did not turn and leave. This movie starts off with a man who has been a criminal for a few years now being released from the prison he was in for a minor assault.|0
I mean really, really, REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean regular high, i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies).|1
"This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s . Otto Preminger directed only four or five really excellent pictures . One of them was his last, ""The Passion Play,"" with John Barrymore and Marlon Brando . ""Passion"" has never really been equaled in my opinion. The rest of them were far inferior. His ""The Miracle Worker"", ""The Passion of Christ"", ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" are all among my favorites of all time. It's a very good movie but I don't think that I ever watched it in my whole life."|0
Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' And the saddest thing of all is that I actually agree with these people's sentiments. Yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them finishes off The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. That's about as scary as it will get, people.|1
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting, there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.Anyway...I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it.|1
Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence.|1
"This film is great! Being a fan of ""The Comic Strip Presents..."" I just knew I would love this film. And love it I do. I finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. However I was annoyed to find that it had been cut! So I'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked!"|1
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew what was going on. I think it's a terrible movie that's just not going to be my favorite. But, I think the beginning is a bit slow. It's like the movie doesn't start until about the third or fourth act. It's just frustrating. If you watch the whole thing, at least the second act would make for a great movie. I'll watch it later. It's the third act that's just...|0
Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible , I could n't help but chuckle to myself at the end! I was watching this movie when I came to the point where the characters started fighting in the middle of the scene. I've never watched that many fight scenes in one film before. I was wondering why the director had made such a horrible mess of it all and why he put so much emphasis on those scenes that the fight was actually happening. There were a few good ones throughout the entire movie but the acting was horrible.|0
"This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see ""Black Day, Blue Night."" There is the late, great J.T. Walsh (""Swing Blade,"" ""Pleasantville,"" ""Red Rock West,"" ""The Last Seduction,"" and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (See also ""Breakdown"")."|1
A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( `` scapegoat '' ) for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a great story, not for the faint hearted, just for a good old fashioned adventure tale. You could be reading it right now... You know, with all the action, suspense... and danger... and suspense. But you are NOT, you are NOT reading it just for those elements. You ARE reading it... because it... is a BEAST of a story.... You don't read it just because the hero is named Buster Keaton.|0
The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter , Patrick Sebastien . He likes music and humor and also loves to write. In this video he talks about his favorite TV shows and how he started to write his own comedy series, which you can find by clicking here. He also talks about what it's like to direct a series with an audience and why it's a great way for writers to work their way in. The show is made for a small audience of only 15-20 people . You can download it for free on this website .|0
"Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the ""film noir"" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) ""dupey"" looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it."|1
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties . It 's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched his empire. Henri was a Frenchman from Lyon who had moved to Paris in 1923. He had worked at the French Ministry of War, and by 1929, he was working as an official at the Salon de la Dépêche, the official publication of the Académie Française, a prestigious French art and literature body. Henri and his wife Marguerite became very close to a young German woman named Elisabeth, and she was already well connected in France.|0
"This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made . Following are the plus points and what the director has done so well to bring to the screen:

The first thing that one notices about this is that everything that happens and is seen in this movie is real and not a dream . You don’t have a whole bunch of CGI characters . This is something that many Indian films have tried to do. The first of which was Rajkumar Hirani’s Ramayan, and the second was Prasanna Kumar’s Kurukshetra, both of which were quite good but not real."|0
UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia.John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property.|1
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s -- films so ridiculous and silly that you could watch them and not feel sorry for them, which was what the filmmakers intended to do with them. In the case of the film that I'm talking about, I'm afraid that I do feel sorry for the characters, but not enough to change their minds in the way that the filmmakers had intended. I'm referring, of course, to the films made by John Stears in the early 70s. Stears was the writer/director of a trilogy of films, all featuring a female protagonist.|0
You know , before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases . I felt like they deserved the punishment they received , I could even say it was unjust . This movie however , brought back the same emotion I had for the characters I grew up with , it brought them to the place they should have gone , which in my eyes was a place they deserved to be. It was a story about people in need , but it also felt like a story about people in recovery .|0
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan . What could be worse than Hogan in a tuxedo? A wrestler in a gorilla suit?!?! I love wrestling but I cannot stand Hulkamania! Hulkamaniac is a terrible character to watch and this film is trying to be like the WWE Network but I can’t stand it either! Hulkamaniac’s gimmick was to have him go ape for the whole movie. The only good thing about the film, and the gimmick, is his hair.|0
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode , Rise of the Cybermen , which was excellent in some respects, but in others didn't quite hit the heights of the last one. With the last episode we were shown what a Cyber-attack from the future would be like and there wasn't much time for the team to react and think as a result. We didn't need that for Rise of Steel, so we went into this episode with some of the characters still wondering where their team members were, if there was any change in their mindsets, and the knowledge that the situation was much, much more complex.|0
Poor Bela Lugosi . Just another day at work . A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort. And that’s only half of it . They’re not alone in their desire to sabotage – they have a lot of resources to go around. I have been waiting for the film to see if it is a sequel to The Terminator (1984). The first movie was quite good in my opinion but this film needs to go much further. The story and characters are well done and the story is quite fascinating.|0
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002."|1
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.While I speak German as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience... So therefore, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are only done by 4 voices!|1
Heftig og Begeistret ( Intense and Enthusiastic ) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in Norway. As part of a yearlong tour they performed at several music festivals and schools, with a performance at an international music conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2013. Heftig og Begeistret was also broadcast to an estimated 2,100 Norwegian school children and their families in 2014. The documentary, produced by Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in Norway, features choir members and their families, as they discuss the origins of the choir, the growth of the band and their personal experiences with music.|0
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race , a killer begins to murder the rest of the women and girls, all of whom he believes are his sister-wives or sisters. After the first murder, they all begin to disappear, leaving the killer, now a woman, alone in the world of the living. She has to learn to respect the others if she hopes to live the life of an adult. After all the killings, the girl's father has to decide what to do in the face of the constant threats. His only daughter has been taken to an orphanage.|0
"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the ""Wackiest Ship in the Arm"" and the ""Pink Sub"" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and ""pirate"" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot."|1
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film . The script is full of holes from start to finish but I did enjoy the film so much that it is probably the best thing I have seen in a very long time. I know that it has many faults in it but that is just the way I roll. I like the characters and the plot and the story. I don’t think that there is anything that needs to be fixed or changed in the film except for the ending.|0
Ahh , nuthin ' like cheesy , explopitative , semi-porn , masquerading as horror ... This one stars Jaqueline Lovell , and has a very similar style. It is about a girl who becomes possessed by a demon after a sexual accident. In a story that is more like a horror film than a horror movie, her boyfriend, who knows what he's doing, is called in to help her get rid of the demon. It looks like her boyfriend is having a bad trip, but it's actually a trick. So yeah, this is one movie I don't want to see again.|0
i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up . ( got the DVD ) I didn’t know any of the doctors, and I had never seen any medical shows on TV. Now, as a physician who has taught medical courses to college students, I watch all of these medical shows because I know that these doctors are giving patients a better medical care than the ones that are watching on TV. To me, watching shows like this helps me learn more, and makes me want to be more knowledgeable.|0
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder.|1
"If you Listen to Ween (The Pod, God/Satan), then you know what's going on with ""Split"" I found that watching the film under the influence of LSD helped to deal with Audio/Video tracers from fantastic editing job. The plot was only important from second to second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...There just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level."|1
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person . The sound tracks are really good too . LOL! I've always enjoyed this film but I always felt it was a little too long to be entertaining, not that it's not worth watching in a shorter time! P.S. This is not the first time you will see this movie in any theater because it is showing on TV. I'm glad to see you like the movie because it's not very well known! I'm surprised you liked it.|0
George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was , it always sucked , and the best he did was look bad and make him look like a stooge, which is exactly what the studio wanted him to do. It’s like they never read the reviews or anything else about this particular movie. I can only assume they wanted him to come across as ‘realistic’ as well as ‘in the moment’ and they wanted it to look bad so that they could make millions of dollars.|0
Okay , so I love silly movies . If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies , over the top movies , I will love you ! I love sci-fi movies . I especially love space movies . This is the first one I have been to so I am sure I will come back and love this movie as much as the first . But I have a question that I am not sure are valid . This is the same question I got when I was in college , what does it mean for a movie to be realistic ? I asked some of the same question , but now in my 30s .|0
Dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong a man and get revenge. It won two Academy Awards ( for Best Supporting Actor and Editing ) and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same year. Dolelemite’s main purpose is to make money from the pimp-hero’s violent acts. This film has been criticized for its violence, but in my opinion, there are worse films out there. In this essay I’m going to discuss what is wrong with Dolemite.|0
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn't have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal.|1
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off. Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. As an actor and filmmaker, I cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. Yet, I must admit, I could not look away.|1
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded , it talks of violence and what there doing , but then again that is what movies are for , and to be honest it wasnt too bad . If you dont mind it is available on amazon for the most part , or you can look it up yourself if you want . I didnt know this movie was so violent , but I didnt mind it . I guess if you are going to get upset then you shouldnt go ahead and watch , but that is what movies are for .|0
... now please move on because that 's getting on my nerves.Seriously , the man behind brilliant pieces like `` The Case Against Common Core'' or `` What Do They Really Know About Elementary Reading? `` is not a person of color (I would guess it is African-American ) so if you want to be a bigot, get the hell over it and stop making a fool of yourself with this man, he is a piece of work. He seems to think I am a piece of work because I am a non-racist white woman, well, so are most people, you know.|0
"there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)""nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed."|1
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . I got the first part with the Spanish dub . The second half and the third and fourth are in English. It is difficult to find the exact words for the actors. You will find out more and more as you go further in this series . I have to warn you that if you want to give it a try and you like the way it's shot , I'd recommend you go for the second half if you want to check it out . I liked it because there are some good and funny bits in this movie .|0
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach . When I watch a movie with a great story I am usually amazed by the way it unfolds , I think about it for a while , I know that it will be a good movie , and it has great visuals and sound , but until the movie comes to life it makes me nervous , and I want to know why it has been a failure . I saw this movie a couple of years ago when I was in the midst of a very stressful time in my life.|0
Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. When entering this, I noted that it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was neither!|1
Down at the Movie Gallery , I saw a flick I just had to see . It looked like a horror movie, but was in fact a good one . The movie was “ Dead Alive ” starring Michael Myers from the classic slasher movie of the 80s . I have watched the original movie about 20 times, so this is a real treat . I’m so excited to see this movie now , I wonder if I can go back in time to when I watched it . I’m glad they made the film available on DVD .|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
While out divining for water , a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns ( Carolyn Kearney ) stumbles upon something she can't quite figure out; an object that has been left here in the desert. Jessica is brought to an old mansion in the desert, which was once a resort and is now a desert retreat. It seems to be haunted and she must find the person who left it . Jessica must use all her psychic powers to discover the truth. What is she to believe? Who is this girl, and where is she now? This is not an easy book to get into.|0
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder why you ever paid for the tickets in the first place. That’s what the critics thought when “Gangster Squad” came out in 2015, and that’s essentially what “Bully” follows this week. You have no doubt seen the trailer for the film, but here’s how it looks: A man (Chad Michael Murray) goes from one job to the next and gets fired from three of them in a few weeks.|0
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a ' 1 ' ? I thought `` Manos , the Handsome Greek God , was the only one who could get anything out of this movie . I think they are all wrong , and the movie isnt what it purports to be , so , its the wrong guys who think they are getting it . ( and I dont get the hype about this , because Ive never liked this movie and have never even seen it)

I agree, it's not the movie and it never will be."|0
Ca n't say this was n't made well . At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took a lot of work . I can't remember precisely where I saw it. It's in my head now and I've been waiting a long time to tell anyone. I've been asked if it's good and if I've had a good experience working with it. Now I don't know. I saw a lot of the first two parts of the film and it's really exciting to be involved in the next phase of the production.|0

"My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that ""Christian"" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good."|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point. If your expecting fast cars, T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this, you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think.|1

I'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS...) Why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. And how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...OK, OK...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity.|1
Ben Marshall , a teen ager from a religious background , is made aware about the financial situation at home by his parents. They want him to get work and support from his parents, but he has to do it himself as he is only 16. The pressure of being a teenager and all the expectations of the future force Marshall to work hard and succeed. This is a very hard reality for Marshall and his parents. Despite all his efforts to find a job, he only receives 15 dollars a day at the food store where he works as a cashier.|0
"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.First of all ""The Messengers"" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial."|1
I mean, come on! This movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.I was really hoping this would be a good movie.|1
When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed.Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music.|1
Wow , I swear this has never happened to me before . I only watched `` Golden Temple Amazons '' a year ago . The only reason is , I knew I had to be there . My family had asked to come so we could watch it with my mom and sister . My parents were a bit nervous at first , I was in my room . But the moment they saw me , they started to cry . I cried with them for about a year . But now , I am finally going to see a show that I never dreamt about before .|0
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . I would think you could get that from the trailer, the music is horrible, the movie just plain doesn't do anything in it. There's also the fact that it's only two-thirds of an hour long, which means that there's probably not too many other good things to come out of it. What a terrible movie and a terrible trailer. I don't mind that the trailer was a horror movie but to have this horrible movie play out in the theatres is pretty sad.|0
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Its been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way! !|1
Once upon a time , way back in the 1940 's , there lived an actress named Veronica Lake . Veronica Lake worked for some very big names in movies . She had a knack for stealing the film's scenes . Her talent made her a hot commodity for movie producers to exploit . One such producer was a Mr. George Stevens . George Stevens was in the movie business from the 1920's to the 1950's . His movie business consisted of producing, financing, and distributing horror films . One movie he never produced or distributed was the movie called The Curse of Niblina .|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the movie was originally aired on ABC in the 70's or 80's, I think, and she was doing the show for CBS. So this movie is pretty fresh in my mind. I wonder what this was like for her in her youth, because it's not something that was ever shown on the television. I'm wondering if there's anything in that movie that we don't know already. As someone who loves to read, I don't think it is a bad film.|0
I 'm a next generation person ... i 've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about this doctor who is really great i want to see him because he is really good and he is the doctor that i want to have because he is the best in the world . This is very interesting, I have been in the same situation for about 7 years, and i have always been sick with colds and allergies. I have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. But now the doctors tell me i need to start taking meds that can cause depression and anxiety.|0
I've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. I feel it's a waste of time to even write this but I'll make it short. Why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurly directed and cut. 2. Bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clichés. 4. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. Bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6.|1
"Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for ""Lady Frankenstein"", a stagy, costumy Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten(""Citizen Kane"")plays the crusty old Baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-ntless European B-films, usually as Rosabla Neri, including ""Hercules Against the Moon Men"", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."|1
I 'm not really sure where to begin . From start to finish , bad , stinky bad , like my breath is so awful that it makes your mouth hurt . This is how bad the odor is . And yes this is my very first trip to the beach , and I have never come this far up the beach before . I 'm not a big fan of eating raw oysters , I have had them once but I hate the smell , even after I washed them . I tried to eat one this morning , when I was walking to work , I was very happy I ate one because it was good .|0
Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody , I have to hear 10 minutes of the movie before I can really get a decent idea what is happening? The movie has been available online in a bunch of formats, including VOD, for over a year now. And while I haven't watched it with a lot of attention, and am a lot more interested in what the rest of you think about this film, it seems like it hasn't been a big hit in terms of ratings.|0
The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Edgar Allen Poe’s friend William Wilson. Wilson wrote a story entitled “The Pit” (1846) based on an idea he had originally had for a “fictional volume of verse.” He used the idea as a way to get the attention of the publisher of a Poe book, who offered him a sum of money. The story has been a staple of ghost stories for years, especially for horror film. It is also in the works as a book.|0
Estevez , Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war with a new outlook on life and what it can lead to. It is very moving and touching. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “If you can stand the taste of the blood, you can drink the blood’’. In a sense, it’s not true for every single human, or every human being for that matter. I’ve heard many people say it in the past.|0
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i 've even seen . Obviously this is n't intentional though . It's actually more like the funniest way of watching a movie in a theater . But if you are looking for comedy this movie is for you . The plot is a bit convoluted, but it has comedy in spades . The humor is a bit childish, but not bad . It's a comedy that you'll enjoy , no matter what age you are . The movie is well produced, and it shows that there are a ton of movies that will be good for comedy .|0
i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie . It was a good movie but not great and not for me. I didn’t really like it. I found myself laughing more than any other film I have seen this year. I was surprised the director was on the phone with his family to get the story started. I found myself laughing when i saw this movie and I found myself thinking how this would make for good family movies. This movie had to end, and it did end.|0
Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it is in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.Next, it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors.|1
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job.|1
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti , do not see this movie . If you did then this review may be worth taking a look at but if you haven't . . .well , you may get a good laugh . I don't even know what I am going to say now . . . but I can't see the need to go into detail about this review without giving away a little of what I want to write about . . . so let me say first of all about the film itself . . . it is a very enjoyable film.|0
"Yeah, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""American Pie"", which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get?Attention, spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before."|1
After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and they invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels.|1
"Badly shot , badly edited , clumsy dialogue , flat characters , unsuccessful adaption of a novel . It does not make for the best film , but that is precisely the point. It simply does not add up to the movie it was intended for, it is not as good as the book, but it’s certainly better than the book was. All I can say about this is, “Well, maybe you don’t like the film .”



The reason I say this is that while the book is good, I don’t want it to be the film."|0
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie . I actually ran across this movie by accident . I was actually looking for a movie I could take my son on vacation in . I never had time to watch . So when I got to the theaters I decided to just go in and get it . I did this because I was on vacation from school and my son was supposed to come with me . I was not expecting to enjoy the movie . But I did and I was so happy with the movie I wanted to make sure I could bring my son to it .|0
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film . For the most part the actors do well . I’ve seen some good acting out of them, however there was a lack of a certain type and it didn’t end up matching up to the actors I thought they could be and I really had to work for it . I liked a few of the lines and some of the actions . However , in the end it was too much . I was hoping that the writing was going to do what it was supposed to and the characters would grow and develop through the story .|0
"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.It had potential."|1
"This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round"" theater."|1
`` Strangers on a Train '' was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never really got. The story of a train ride from London to London, I think it was, is very good, with some great scenes in the middle, and some good scenes of London and the train. I was very glad to see the film again. The first time I saw this film I was 12. It was the weekend before it was released and I went to see it at a matinee.|0
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's.|1
Normally, I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like?|1

Look , do n't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON ! I could barely sit through some of them as I didn't have much choice but to sit through a couple or three. I'm sure many people enjoyed the movies but I found them all too predictable. What happened to having a few good independent movies to watch every now and then? I've got nothing but bad taste but I won't be the only one that says it. I am glad this came up on this list. It's something that I should have asked, but I was not feeling the need to.|0
There is a difference between a `` film , '' and a `` movie . '' A film , regardless of what language , is basically a series of still shots and sound effects . A movie , regardless of what language , is basically a story based on a story and some dialog . In other words , ''a film'' is basically a story , a narrative . ''In the beginning . '' A story can be a story of a few words or a story with many many words . '' Films can be a film with no words .|0
"Though it's better than most made-for-TV movies, ""Buried Alive"" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. There are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. The ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.The acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, as always, but Tim Matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"". Don't bother with this one."|1
With its ww2 timing , falling in and out of love , and easy on the eye Kira , this game has it all. Kira and her crew are sent in to investigate the destruction of an ancient city. They encounter a large alien creature , who turns out to be an alien race in the employ of an alien race , the Krell . Kira tries to deal with the Krell in the hopes of getting to the truth of the events leading up to it. I think I have a bit of a bias with the plot of this game because I am a big sucker for sci fi.|0
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down.|1
This is a very modest , very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a fantastic cast. This is what the film is like. It has a great script, a great story, and lots and lots of characters and plot twists that you'll never believe were even part of the original script. This is not the original story. There is a very simple story behind the story and a few plot twists that will put you on your toes as the film progresses through the entire film.|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies , mainly because of the ending , but it's good in a way to set up the next couple of movies to come . . . and I still like it as a whole . . . The only issue I had with this movie is that I did not know it was called that before we started watching it . . . but it's still a great movie . . . especially if you get your kids to sit quietly in the theatre . . .|0
This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn't heard about before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It's a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years.|1
"I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I haven't seen it since then, because I was too young to enjoy it. I've seen many other movies since then, but most of them are so bad that I just couldn't see them again. If I was to recommend a good remake, I would have to think of something similar to the original that's good. But what is? What is a remake? What is a ""good"" remake? The answer is, a remake is a remake is a remake."|0
This movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long, long while. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar.|1
That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW . At least Ed Wood 's misguided attempt at making a haunted house was well-done. And for the record . . . The only movie I know about that makes sense of haunted houses is NIGHT OF THE THIRTEEN DEAD, and the only one of these that is truly original (and well-done) is THE BERKLEY HITCH-CAMPAGNA . And there it is again. I could go through every movie in the Horror genre that I haven't already seen. I would love to do it, I think. But I can't.|0
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She 's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid attention to during the filming. In fact, she should've been there for the movie, since it's a big movie and Bullock's name is in it. Bullock, who is actually quite good, is an actress in the mold of Meryl Streep (the best of them all), which is a great achievement in any genre. But what's the big story? Is there a major plot point that will stick with you?|0
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it's natural that I'd choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting.|1
I was sorely disappointed in this movie. Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. The movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.Dutcher's God's Army One was okay.|1
`` Mishima : A Life in Four Chapters '' is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative simplicity - it's a film noir masterclass. The story is based on an actual case of a man found dead at his office, with a bloodied knife beside him, who turned out to be the victim of an attack in which he was slashed with a machete, the scene of the crime made explicit in the film, so that the reader is kept up to date on the details of the incident. Mishima's approach to the story is unique and powerful.|0
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more. The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending.|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra.|1
It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children?|1
I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that I've owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of- it was so worthless that I couldn't see ever wanting to watch ANY of it again.However, I do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 pages of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars.|1
"OK, so I gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was precisely its trailer.At the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself ""no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes"" while i rolled my eyes in shame."|1
"""Rififi"" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. Jules Dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the Hollywood glamour of ""Ocean's Eleven."" The robbers in ""Rififi"" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence."|1
"This is a wonderful comedy short -- one of Keaton 's absolute best . Through a long series of silly misunderstandings, Keaton is given the opportunity to get revenge on the bullies he has been bullied since childhood. This short really captures the joy and charm of the '90s. You can find Keaton 's entire short collection and many more of his other works on his Youtube channel. Also check out the trailer below:



I really like the ending where he learns how to act. It was a very touching short. I found it hard to leave the theater."|0
`` First Snow '' has an intriguing beginning . A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man who appears on a snow-covered mountain . As the story progresses, the man takes on the persona of the narrator, who then tells the reader that the entire story is true, but in a different way. The book moves forward quickly and with ease, giving the reader a sense of awe for what the narrator is saying and a sense of amazement as the snow falls on him . It is a book that anyone with a love of history and travel will enjoy.|0
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue.|1
"While it's not ""perfect"", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! ""The baby swallowed the watch"" was always my son's favorite line.Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall."|1
I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster . It's a really entertaining and funny movie, and it's got some great actors in the parts I thought I'd be better off not watching. I'm not sure I really care that much, but I can't help thinking that it's kind of weird to have your movie watched so many times before you've seen it in theaters. That's probably why I've had it sitting on my shelf for a couple years now.|0
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video . It features passable acting , but a very poor sound design , with a very boring plot . The movie follows the lives of three teenage girls who decide to get revenge against their father who has been doing a lot of bad stuff to them . The story of the Screaming begins on one of the main characters , and then jumps back and forth in time . This is a low budget movie about revenge , it is definitely very low , but is not that cheap either .|0

What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow .|1
"Great book , poorly done movie . Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest . Flat characterizations and flat performances , especially by the lead actor and the lead actress . Poorly written , badly directed , with a poor story . Not even worth watching , and even less worth paying for

This movie has been criticized for not really doing much and for being overly predictable . I can agree that it's not really the best movie ever , but not a very bad one either . It's a fairly decent little film ."|0

Admittedly , the only reason I watched this film -- since it 's been about a decade since it was released -- is because my dad got it from the video rental place that I work at. If I remember my memory correctly, it was in the early 2000s. I have no memory of the original release date of the film, and I don't remember seeing the film before, but I do remember that my dad owned a VCR from when I was a kid. Anyway, here we go with my memory of this wonderful film.|0
"Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. When he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that ""other folks garbage"" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill."|1
This is a difficult movie to watch , and would have been even more difficult had I known then that it wasn't going to end with a big bang and the credits rolling. At the time I thought it was great, but over time I realized that the first 20 minutes were the weakest portion, and it wouldn't make a big impact on my life until the second half of the film. I've watched the entire movie a couple times since, and still find it interesting and entertaining, but I'm afraid that I may never see the last half.|0
"I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him I would have to take back my promise. We kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.This ""movie"" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100."|1
"The most amazing film I have ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw. I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U.S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way."|1
"I can't quite explain why I find this so alluring and ""The Leopard"" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story."|1
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in South Australia. It was published in 2005 and has since been adapted to television. Contents

Plot

The story is set at a mine, in the late 1980s, where there was a crew of miners missing. The miners come from a mining town in South Australia called Mount Gambier. They are called the Bone Snatcher, and are searching for a crew member, who was missing for two years. In the mining town there are two people who were involved with the missing crew."|0
First, what is really great about this movie: - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - Horrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - Very annoying character Melissa.|1
Ed ( Kel Mitchell ) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger , a small but well-established local burger joint in rural North Carolina. It’s a quiet place, and he has barely been out of the house except to eat his lunch or go to school. It’s a typical North Carolina experience. One night when he’s just getting ready for bed he sees a shadow in the bathroom mirror. His face registers surprise. But when he turns, he sees a tall, thin boy dressed in black jeans and a white t-shirt and a baseball cap, standing behind him.|0
"This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems. We also know he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots. Examples which I am fond of include, ""Dark Star,"" ""O.C. & Stiggs,"" and ""Popeye."""|1
Look , this film is terrible ... the `` plot '' involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents , and they find a way of getting by by killing people on their way home and leaving the body on a beach .... that is the worst plot idea ever ! You're right ! I was thinking this film was bad. I'm sorry I watched it, but I can't stop thinking of this film as being one of the worst I've seen in my lifetime. It could have been good, but the ending just seems like a complete waste.|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not equaled today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer.Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of his mystique. Hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image.|1
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory . The story takes place during the same time line as the events in Mobile Suit Gundam . It starts off with some young pilots from the U.S. being tasked with destroying an unknown enemy base in space. Unfortunately, those pilots only know each other and there is no one to guide them through. However, one man is determined to learn the ways of fighting for the cause and become the next leader in the Gundam army. He is only in his for the good of all mankind. This story is mainly focused around the character known as Guts.|0
I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher films on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films.To be fair, it started off OK, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods.|1
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous.|1
"Did people expect ""Jurassic Park 3"" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil."|1
What a cast...and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality. The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. Yeah, I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.The story is not only messy and unlikely, it also isn't exactly terribly original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies.|1
Hilary was great as julie , and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi , but there should have been more action sequences in this film, and if there were, the Japanese could have pulled it off. However, for the lack of it, it was nothing special. The movie could have been much better, and should have been much more action packed, if only they had done it. If you like action, you’ll love this film, but for the sake of my sanity, I had to give it a 3 star rating just for trying to be a modern day samurai movie.|0
"Like the above poster, I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha... This movie is everything the above poster said and worse... Poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...There was very little here that was even worth watching... How this movie even got released is beyond me. Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.The movie I bought was labeled ""Piranha"" and not ""Piranha, Piranha!"" which is what it actually is... This is the only way they sold this movie at all.Peace Out."|1
I must admit , ashamed though I am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was not something that I thought I would enjoy. In fact I don't think I would give a flying fck what I thought about it whatsoever (well not to say I don't think I would give a flying fck about it, I would just never admit it). The film has an interesting premise , a young girl is killed off by some bad guys , as you see her body in the basement , we can assume she has been taken over and murdered by the bad guys.|0
Boring movie . Poor plot . Poor actors . The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco, but it turns out that the guy is in the middle of the Middle East... and that is not a pleasant experience. It is interesting, too, that this film is made by an English director and starring an English actor. I'm not sure I buy that it was really made in England, and not just for the sake of being a British movie about England and the English. One thing to note is that there are three different endings in the film.|0
"This is a forgotten classic of a film, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for ""Gummo"". Gummo is good, River's Edge is way, way better. Its no secret that Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. No, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover."|1
OK , it was a `` risky '' move to rent this flick , but I thought I had nothing better to do than watch it , as it wasn't one that I had seen before . I wasn't wrong , but I didn't have much of an appetite for a flick that I hadn't seen . This was a film with a lot to it . I watched it and enjoyed it , but it wasn't something that appealed to me . I had a tough time getting into it . A great script , with a great story , and a well written and produced film that was very entertaining .|0
I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet).|1
OH MY God I am lost Now I know everything this guy does is Pointless R J A wrote at August 13th, 2006 (posting no. 881): What an awful experience.

I went to see this movie to kill some time . I remember Cole Hauser in `` Tigerland '' , a movie that made me think of the fact that I had no one that I knew to talk to. ( I mean I had a few friends that were there ) I was looking for a place that we could get together and have some time to talk. And I also wanted to talk with my friend that was with me all the while . So I went to the movie theater. I went in there and started to see who I could find to talk with.|0
At first I did n't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky , but as her growth continues I'm going to give her a chance. She has a decent range, great range, and she works her range really well. I think she would do very well in a pinch if you were willing to put in the extra hours of training, but you would also have to be willing to push her a bit if you are looking to push her harder. I think she would definitely be a hard hitter with a high strike out percentage and a high on base percentage.|0
This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen . And believe me , I have seen a LOT worse . It's just so sad . The dialogue was terrible , and while the plot moves along , it just drags it out . I really hate this movie . And while i enjoyed it , I didn't find the acting that i expected . This movie just doesn't do anything right , and i don't know why , because all the other things were just so bad . It was just so bland , and the actors just had no charisma or any charm .|0
"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding , confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B in The Big Picture. In fact, for some strange reason Post spends the whole episode trying to make it seem even more “bizarre” and “disappointing” than it had to be to be “good.”

I’d like to point out, though, that there’s nothing in the entire episode that actually needs to be said. The story is a very silly one. It’s so silly that it makes you want to laugh. A lot."|0
"this is horrible film. it is past dumb. first, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in 7th grade. not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being pretty and popular is not everything. but that is what the twins make it out to be. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to France. He has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two ""cute french boys"" with motorcycles."|1
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around) a heroin addict really is. Good movie, which will never truly be outdated. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE'S world can become. Worth a look--an education of sorts. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in.|1
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH."|1
This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen . I 've spent four years at the age of 30 and the worst I had to show at a film festival was a movie which made me cry tears of blood. Now at the age of 50 I have to see and endure the same type of film. This is a wonderful film, even if it is an American comedy. There are so many moments where you can tell that the film makers are having a great time. They are having a ball, but that is what makes them fun.|0
I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale . In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially the lady in the black shirt. I can't say much about the film but it was a bit dark and I liked the music. It was an entertaining film and it is nice to see this kind of genre on screen again . I'm glad to see more of these kinds of films again. Keep up the great stuff. This was quite good as well, especially the ending and the ending of the song! I liked all the songs, especially the one with the lady!|0
"This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom. Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI. She is the ""daughter of the regiment"", loved as a little sister. Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper."|1
"This is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Some kind of Wonderful"".Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.True, most of the acting sucks but ...I have been in love with Nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since."|1
"The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously helpful to people, and should be used as the primary focus of Christian ministries. It is one of the main things that can be used to develop Christian discipleship and discipleship of others. In addition, this discussion of God and Satan is also one of the things the church can use to teach about how we live together as one body in the Body of Christ:

In 1st Corinthians 10:17-18, Paul is instructing the church about how we should relate to God."|0
Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'The Street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the American productions.There was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'.|1
I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and not expecting anything but the worst.This is the 2nd time I've had to wait on someone to get a new computer.I've never waited like that - and never had it taken so long, either.I also had my laptop stolen last year, and it was taken care of on time, so I can understand why the wait - but it still seems like a big inconvenience.There's just something a little strange about the way it was done.|0
"The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic ( and also its only theme ) the struggle for freedom and equality in all its forms in the country of France. The film was made in 1883, a few years before the 1848 Revolution and the events that preceded it. The film is based on one of the most well-known of the texts of the French Revolution, the one that became the official text of the French Republic and which is the book ""The History of the French People""."|0
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw , however, I found the characters and storyline to be very believable and I would not want to pass on that. The movie also looked very good. I am assuming that this was the first time you had ever seen a film in this way. I did not see the plot but I would assume it was something similar to the previous films you had seen in the past, however, I would assume that this movie is different as you have not seen the previous movies.|0
this movie is n't that great ... at all but it 's good when you want to just laugh , it 's got a lot of funny stuff and i like it that way. If you have never seen it then you really should but if you were like me then maybe it 'd be really boring but still i think that it is good ... if i had to pick a better movie to go watch then that might be it ... anyways that movie i think is a really good one and im glad that i watched it.|0
"I'm going to recommend putting this one in the ""skip it"" pile as well. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah, well.....The costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the Period Costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - everyone dressed like they were at court in Versailles."|1
"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive."|1
"I always loved this film . The music , story and the action . I especially love the opening and ending credits as they are really a piece of art work. It was my first movie and the first time watching it for a couple of weeks. But I am a huge fan and will be watching all of the new releases in this summer. Thank you for watching. If you like it I’m sure you would like it. But I hope that you don’t get bored . 🙂

I watched the whole thing, in two parts."|0
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. It fared modestly OK at the box-office.Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in New York City--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. Instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by Faye) was never filmed.|1
Andy McDermott ( Tom Everett Scott ) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Alex. McDermott is on his first trip abroad, but he has never traveled to a foreign country. On this vacation trip he is excited when he meets Alex, his childhood friend who has been friends with him from childhood. When they meet, McDermott falls for Alex’s good looks. As the boys grow in friendship, Alex begins to get jealous when McDermott spends more and more time with Brad.|0
"Oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of ""worst 80's slasher ever made"". ""The Prey"" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!)."|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. A bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.It's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex.|1
`` Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable '' , the third in the series , is a magnificent piece of work! The artwork is fantastic, the colouring is vibrant, and the character design is fantastic! I've been playing the game for a long time now and the characters are my favourites of all the ones I've played in the series. The art work is superb and I've only been playing since about three weeks now so I have a lot of love for this one. My favourite character so far, so I would say is the male Scorpion.|0
"This is a stereotype plot . A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is taken away for ""psychological treatment"" . His opponent then tries to enter and he is unable to, and the match is over. The character is a bit stereotypical but I think the plot of it is good. I think it has some depth to it, and that's what I like in a wrestling movie. That's the only thing I think it has that's a bit over the top, it's over the top."|0
This movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt, Julie Andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates.|1
I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid.|1
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent.|1
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was, but this film was so weird... I mean the film itself is very weird, it's a weird story that I just watched and it's also a story that the director is trying to tell us and I think it is very unique. I really liked it, you can check this film out and also watch it on youtube. It's actually the first movie I ever seen that was like that. I liked the movie even though its weird.|0
Pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. All the characters are OK, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing.|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder , two other scientists , a pilot , and the guy who plays the robot in The X Files. They were a team of scientists who were working in a facility in New Mexico. Scully and Mulder were trying to save the world. It seemed like they were in danger but then Scully came in and told them they would all be safe with him. They were told to come up with some kind of plan and they thought they had found it . However , Scully and Scully's team didn't have a plan.|0
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan . I figured it could n't be that bad because of all the comedy in it. I didn't expect much from this one. I think I saw it twice because I liked it more the second time. I'm not really a big fan of these type of movies. I'd give it 4/5 if I could because of the good humor. It's not the greatest movie. It's not that funny. It doesn't have much story. It isn't that funny. And, it's definitely not that funny.|0
So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a special. As I remember, when I first got home, I didn’t even realize what day it was (the first day of my return to work). I didn’t even realize it had been over a year. For most people, that would be fine, but not me. I’ve only been at this job for a week and a half, and every day I’m learning something about this place and how much I really love it.|0
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years . There have been other films before that delved into issues that I didn't care to explore, but this one had a strong, clear vision of what the future could hold and it did it very well. As a director, I've been fortunate. I've directed films that others haven't. And yet, in a very different way than the other directors I have directed, I was lucky to have seen a lot of movies in this one. And so, there is a chance I will direct another film like this.|0
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. One of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor Peter Coyote lives in.|1
An under-appreciated, unseen gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It's not unlike Born on the Fourth of July, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-Vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc. ), this one deals with a much more personal topic: Family.|1
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw . The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film. The first time I saw this movie, I saw it on tv and I was not impressed . The only reason I saw it was that it came on tv and I watched it for a little bit, then it got canceled and I was in a bad mood from it . At least I don´t remember seeing the movie with that. As for the story . There is absolutely no reason to explain it. Not a single one .|0
Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this film is horrible.William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do.The film's setup is way too long.|1
"""Out to Sea"" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance."|1
first off, i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to IMDb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs.|1
Down Periscope is not a `` Great Movie '' . But then again very few flicks are . So if you've spent all your time in the theaters you probably don't know what this film is about. But if you've just seen this trailer and you want to see the full version of the movie, then this review will give you just that . And to make up for it , this movie is the first of a two part series . And yes this is the beginning of the second part . And yes this is a real movie .|0
"For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture that is the reason I still think the movie is a good movie

Well, after seeing the movie I don’t even know if I could say that the whole story is completely false or not, just because I thought it was a pretty stupid movie. There’re so many things in the movie that I could totally agree with and also think it is a really bad movie, and it was pretty bad in fact. If you are a Ninja lover, don’t watch the movie."|0
"RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955)To me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a Hollywood-remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business... How they're gonna pull this off?Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and went on to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some ""The Grandddady of all caper- and heist movies""."|1
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels.|1
"This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen . the acting was god awful , the story line was the worst i have ever seen , the acting was god awful . !!! !!! !!!! i have seen worse movies

If you're looking for a movie to enjoy on your next date, I suggest you pick something with a good cast and good storyline. If the acting sucks then you will not enjoy the movie at all. I've seen bad movies in the past but that was a while ago."|0
I grew up in the 90s ; therefore , you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the state of south africa . it was during the civil war between india and africa . both the african republic and south african states fought a civil war for over fifty years until the end. the fighting was always fierce between the two countries . one could see that there was a lot of hatred and warring between the two countries. the south african state was very weak , but it was still trying to gain some form of independence from africa.|0
I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful. Im glad that Casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority. Its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent.' I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head, as well. All the guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I cant wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, & Rusty!|1
"Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College , and judging from the enthusiastic response , he has much to offer. The 6' 8"" forward was a highly touted prospect back in December of last year, and he's had a solid rise to the point where he's been selected in the NBA Draft's top-10. The problem, however, is that while the Boston College team is a well-rounded one, they are still missing a few pieces to make the team better. One such missing piece is a high-quality point guard, but that is precisely why we are discussing Monroe's situation in today's section."|0
"This film flopped miserably in the UK, and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was ""Atonement: Part 2"". While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to Wales."|1
"In yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called ""Women Who Kick Butt"", but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, during most of the movie Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie."|1
If a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere.|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike ( David Zelina ) & his mates decide to to give up the boring life for a life in the wild. This adventure is the tale of a boy's struggle to cope with his life at sea, his desire for adventure & his determination to help others. A boy who lives in the shadows of life at sea. The story of Mike's courage & determination through the sea, his determination to overcome obstacles, his bravery & determination in becoming a great sea dog. His determination for the future of mankind.|0
"I just saw this movie and all I can say is , where are the drive in 's these days !!! I saw this movie and I thought , ""That's not like a movie that I usually see "", but I guess it's ok because I don't see many of these movies and I was able to sit still for a good 5 or 6 mins. So I'll pass this review on and see how I feel in the next movie. My name is Mike, and I'm an aspiring movie buff."|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one . I wasted about 15 minutes just looking at a few images, and then spent a total of 10 minutes going through all of the images I tried. It was quite interesting as I got through all of them. I thought I would have more time since I had all of this going on, but it looks like I don't get that much time. That's okay! It's also nice to see how many different things there are to this site, and how many pictures are in each.|0
William Petersen ( that C.S.I guy ) has a small uncredited role but it 's the best part of the film! The character he plays in this movie is one of the most complicated to play because the character was never actually written in the script. He was originally written to be a man, and a man that was actually a good man. He was a bad man in the script. You could argue that the director made it easier on him when he made him a male character, but they couldn't do this with the female characters.|0
Korea 's answer to `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' follows a similar story route to its predecessors in the first three installments, so let's move on a bit. The first thing to note is that we are now in a world in which a girl's true identity (or lack thereof) has been disclosed, and a man's life has been placed on the line in the middle of this revelation. It is no longer a given that the man will live or die in the eyes of his own family.|0
I rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. Fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). Wondering if the fast forward function on your VCR works?|1
I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor.|1
"Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored Scorpion Mobile. She battles the evil Breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved the bit about her having to say ""Yo"" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! It's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion ""attacks"" her partner steals the show."|1
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home . it's a must have for the fans and a must watch for any anime fan. the only bad part in this anime is the story line and some of the plot but overall the story lines are great. What an awesome anime to watch. If you haven't checked it out, make it a point right now to do so! It's a great way to pass time, relax, and enjoy all the anime you watch in one go.|0
It's not fair. I was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, After seeing Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes.|1
"Movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. Sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. A light hearted ""golden years"" romantic comedy, Out To Sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs to be given a break. This is just good, light hearted fun. It's not meant to be a deep movie."|1
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane. It was a HUGE waste of time seeing this crappy film. There are a lot of things i hate about this movie: The songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'Grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of Santa' which i hit 10 Times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel.I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen.|1
Ostensibly, Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. And despite the complex portrayal--Hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims--the above must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking as well (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may look no further than Hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion.|1
"Another lame attempt to make a movie `` gritty '' and `` thought provoking '' - whatever the hell that means

The film is about a detective who goes on a quest to figure out who murdered two people. He finds that the murder is somehow connected to another murder in which the murderer's mother (a woman) was a victim. He must track this murder down, and he does find the two victims, and the murderer (the killer, who has since gone on to kill many more people) is a woman, a mother."|0
It's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(Anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), Anderson's unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell......That's why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much. Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days.|1
Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane) and Gene Kelly. This version was directed by Norman Jewison , who did the TV version of THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . He directed this show . This show was a big deal in the 1960's. It aired in syndication in the mid 1970's. I think it's in my collection somewhere . I can't get it. I don't know the title. It's also on tape . I don't know the credits. There is a documentary about it on the internet .|0
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake.|1
"In terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, taking the side of ""the people"" against ""the nobles."" This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war."|1
Wayne Wang 's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than `` Slums of Babylon ``. I mean the film was very well done, the story was excellent and the film looked like a very well done movie! I really liked it a lot. However, I was rather disappointed with the action scenes in the first two thirds of the film, where the action in the first two third is just very slow paced, where you have to sit and wait for the action scenes to start.|0
"This really is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. The further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their ""acting"". I viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! The location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. I suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard."|1
When this series aired I watched most of it . I think it was supposed to be a long running series, but it wasn't . It didn't last very long, so I'm not sure whether I've watched more than one season. I haven't watched most of season 5 yet. If I do, it will probably come out sooner than later, so I'm not looking forward to watching season 5. I don't own season 5. I do own all of the episodes that are in season 5 and I will be purchasing the DVD set to watch the rest.|0
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in ""Beware, My Lovely,"" a 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on a Broadway play called ""The Man,"" Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home. She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on."|1
"This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie . In one scene , the camera very slowly pans up , looks down , looks back again and the whole scene is very blurry , this made me feel like the cameraman was walking around the house , I could not understand what the cameraman was saying or what the guy was saying
The story line is really bad , the story line starts in the movie and the ending is really good but the movie just was so boring , the story was so boring , the plot was so bad ."|0
It's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. These days it's shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC.It pains me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. It's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog.|1
This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life . It is a complete waste of money. It had no story and I don't even like the actors. The ending was so stupid they coulda filmed it in a different time period but it's not a good ending. I have seen it three times. The acting was bad and the movie was bad. They should be ashamed of themselves. If they can't come up with a good ending then maybe they should just stop making movies. And if they are so ashamed of themselves, then why did they come out with this garbage?|0
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch. Too unreal. It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. Who couldn't do that? The cheating was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards?|1
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (! ), but KvC ain't quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there.|1
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and Jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.But she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions.|1
This is by far the most vapid , idiotic , insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air on TV and it is even worse than usual. They have to change the channel. If you go to any one of their shows , you will hear the host say, ” This is a show for people that can’t stand that.” and that is why it is so vapid, and that is why they have to drop it and do another show on other topics. It is really pathetic to watch their shows .|0
"For the record, I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. I think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the ""geniuses"" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and MEET THE SPARTANS.I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies."|1
Oppenheimer was a GREAT series ( it was the first thing I saw Waterston in ) and it is too bad I did not catch the other 3 as well because they are some of the best movies in any genre in the genre. I did have the opportunity to catch the others, but unfortunately it was raining, and we had to turn them off as they were running too far from the projector ( I am not sure why ) I could not watch any of them as it was too cold, but the others were great nonetheless.|0
"Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic ""Godfather"" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded."|1
This movie had very few moments of real drama . After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral of violence . In the beginning there was very little violence . After a short period of this the violence increased . The story is about a young girl from a small town in the north . The girl is living alone . One day a car full of people comes to their house . The car leaves with the inhabitants in it . There are no other cars that come by their house except the one in the beginning of the movie . In the car is a young man who is married .|0
My parents may enjoy this show , but I fail to find the humor in it . What is so funny about this show ? The main point is how much time is wasted by all the people at home on this show , and not on the other show. How about all the shows we see on television ? The only thing that really makes this show great is the voice of the female voice actress that voices the characters on this show. She has the best delivery of the voice actress of a female character on this show . Her voice is so realistic .|0
A satire about greed and money , what ? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than the reality. The government in power now has the power of the gun , and the money that they create is not for them , it is for you . Here is the real story ... The government took a loan from Goldman Sachs for $2.9billion. This was a loan for a hedge fund and the government took an equity in that fund. This is an example of why the government will NEVER take an interest on these types of loans.|0
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires . What does one do with desire in this situation? What is one to do with desire ? There are three options for me to choose from. One is to do as I'm told by God. Another is to fight against God's will. A third is to let my desire run riot in my soul. The third I choose not to allow . It is hard not to allow it to happen. I chose to be in control of my desire, but I can't control it.|0
I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one more season, but that hasn't happened. And while I didn't expect it to, the fact is that Angel is the best show on television. The only show on television that I've seen more of the past two years than Buffy is probably Game of Thrones. I don't think there's a good reason that Buffy couldn't have had more of Angel, but I've never really liked the show.|0
"Wow . What can I say ? I was born in 1960 . I love bad TV movies . Love them . I love the actors and actresses they portray . My favorite show of the 60's was "" The Prisoner ."" The first season of "" The Prisoner "" started on January 18th , 1962 . I was watching the series when I received a phone call from my mother . The call went something like this . She was crying , and she was worried that I would be sent to prison . She gave me her address and I called my mother back ."|0
"if u haven't seen Vijay in ""Ghillli"", ""Gilly"" or ""Ghillie"". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls Velu ""Maacha"". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are brilliant as well. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it."|1
I agree with the guy above , It is so funny I understand it all , but my friends just don´t get this , lol , they´re still in school , I´m not , I don´t care , they still have to learn how to work as a normal adult , they also don´t get this idea that they can do everything , and not work at all . I guess that the reason is they don´t know the meaning of money and what to do with it . It´s so boring to have to earn it , just like I was saying above .|0
"This movie is on cable sporadically, and I never really watched it, thinking it would be similar to the Bruce Willis film ""Ïn America"", with the usual trite story about American freedom, etc. But it was not; it was so much more!.Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I have never seen him in a movie I haven't loved, even if the script is bad, because he is so talented). Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job."|1
This is n't exactly a complicated story . It 's not a mystery , or a plot you have to figure out as a teen . It's a story of a boy's life and a boy's quest for happiness . This is the story of a little boy . A very young boy who is searching his own path . Who searches to find what his parents don't , find out the meaning of their life , their purpose . And who finds that path . And finds his true identity . Who finds himself and his happiness . There was a time when life was all about making money .|0
Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren 's missing son, who has been kidnapped. While the pair attempt to make it to where they are suppose to be to find a solution to the matter, they soon find themselves on the side of one of the two 'natures' of the beast, one they are determined to defeat in order to keep from losing everything to the 'other', and they soon find themselves working to save their son from something greater than they ever imagined.|0
i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell.|1
OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart.|1
"Having just seen Walt Disney 's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube , I was pleased to see a copy of The Skeleton Dance in my blogroll. I can only hope it does well enough to warrant a print edition too. Here's a clip of the dance by Disney:

My blogroll is full, and I have lots of posts I'd like to share."|0
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. Think of that conman's conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic.|1
"In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything ""real"" about this legend need to grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. You guys seriously need to grow up.The fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't do it either."|1
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high-school students tries a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.|1
"...and in this series, I've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, ""Xena, the Warrior Princess"", and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for TV."|1
"Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar, it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.The plot line may have been a little thin, but what B movie isn't. I understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging every movie like it is an Oscar contender, just silly."|1
"Obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the ""Blair Witch"" wave.This movie was set up like all the ""reality"" haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately (and I must admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the ""participants"" going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups."|1
Honestly , I do n't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show . It embraces every type of sexual orientation and I find it hard to think of a show that did this . I understand it's in a more mainstream setting but that doesn't excuse it . I can live with this . I can also live with it . In fact I'm actually excited about what I'm watching . It doesn't change what it is . I just don't like it . Not at all . I am not a big fan of these shows .|0
This film's a big bore. It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. It starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.Surya & Jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? He disappears totally after a good half an hour!. Santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.AR's tunes sure will last for sometime. But he could have done better. What ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.|1
Genius or utter madness ? That depends on your interpretation of this film . I responded to it on the basis of my experience. If you want to find out which of those two it is , read the comments on the Film Review website or watch my review of it here . It's not easy, though, as the review says. There's a lot of hype going on right now, some good, some bad, and if you want to be well informed about it , watch the movie and watch the reviews . There are three big questions here that should be addressed.|0
There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying.|1
Ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. The movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. Do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby. The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a pair.|1
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' London.The movie is held completely in 'dark' colours, which I personally don't like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.|1
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some Indians who speak in English and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north Indian plains. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars of India in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.|1
"If you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.I couldn't help but to think to myself, ""Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?"" Example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck."|1
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. Have a look at the outfits. Everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! It's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows.|1
OK the box look interesting , the opening have great music and its kinda original , to that its all that and a bit too much . but to me its a tad too big to be good , i dont think i will want to keep it. but if i wanted to get rid of this i would . i wouldnt mind it if it was a bit different , but i would rather like it . but if i was going to keep it and if it was a bit better , i would rather have something else . the colour is nice , it is a dark color .|0
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game , but , after a successful career , he has to retire due to lack of health condition . This time there’s no talk of retiring and he has joined a new company that has a lot of challenges ahead . Harlan Banks has a unique background in the game , he was born on the island of Trinidad , he is the grandson of one of the wealthiest Trinidadians , he left his home to work as a lawyer , he was educated at Trinity College, he later worked as a newspaper journalist , he became the president of the Caribbean Cricket Council .|0
The cinematography is the film's shining feature. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there's a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. It's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight.|1
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.But Rita drives this whole movie.|1
Very enjoyable 50 's Western . I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature albums. A wonderful album from the mid-70's, though I'm not really sure why the label is still around in my opinion. There are a lot of tracks that sound pretty good, and even if they don't you can always listen to an album from the mid-80's or early 90's and compare it to the one that is on this one, especially when the two are of equal length, because that's where most of the great music of the '70's was released.|0
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going . The first scene shows a woman who appears to be asleep, when she wakes up to find that her legs have been amputated by a man. When he tells her where she is she replies : “I had a dream. It was about me.” She goes on to tell him about how the dream is all her and that she needs to tell her husband about it, but he is not there and she is unable to make it happen.|0
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins . The premise is that the nation 's dissidents ( hippies, yippies, radicals and anarchists ) live in fear and dread of retribution for their ' un-PC ' political beliefs. But the reality is that they really do fear punishment, but they don't think they are receiving it. They think they will suffer a lot of public humiliation and suffering for daring to believe different things and for disagreeing with the establishment. So what they really fear is the public humiliation and suffering of becoming the public enemy number 1. But they are wrong.|0
This is one of the most horrible 'scary ' movies I 've seen for awhile . I had to wonder if they were really gonna do a sequel! They did not do one of the worst things to ever be done, just a second installment. Oh well, I guess we will never know. It's not like I will be buying another ticket. I guess that makes it worth it though. If I could get a ticket to one of those 'scary' movies I might actually go. The story line is really well thought out and well done.|0
So keira knightly is in it...So automatically we compare this film to attonement. Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.The Actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.If you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.This film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath.|1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film 's plot details than I could . What he missed was that it took place in the '70s, i.e. the early '70s, and was not based on a true story . I had to read a number of other reviews before I decided to read this one , and as much as you may feel like you know exactly what you’re going to read, you may feel that you have to put the book down first and then pick it up later.|0
I have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. It is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. I totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. I think it is a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I have shown it to simply loves it. It is too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success.|1
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top V.I.P employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible.|1
What can I say ... not much to this one at all . Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are just as bad as the production, nothing really stands out at all and the dialogues are just average as well.The film is just so boring that I could not really enjoy it. It is not that I hate this movie and it may have been made by someone who is trying to be a better filmmaker than the ones that made the previous ones. Just that I didn't really get what was happening. It may be that I didn't get it and I just don't care for it.|0
I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Ben I thought this is going to be a little treat.Oh how I felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.2.|1
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting.|1
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all.According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being Percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the Pimpernel, but here he just looks bored asPercy and mean as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, andElizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat.|1
As horror films go , `` Rest Stop '' , could have been better in many levels . Director/writer John Carpenter was the one who came out with the idea to make a movie about serial killers . Carpenter was well aware of this fact when the story of the film was conceived and he put it together with some of his favorite actresses . However , it seems that this was not the first time that Carpenter came up with this idea . The story of Carpenter`s first film `` The Thing In The Walls ,'' is just about the best thing about it .|0
For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. If each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love.|1
Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town . It 's the same life because Junior doesn't like it . But his dad says that Junior doesn 't need to be so worried about it . His father tells Junior that this is just another job . And if he can 't get it, then he can 't get it . And Junior says that this is the only way he 's going to make it. His dad says . This is your dream, your dream, your dream and your dreams will all come true. It doesn't get better with this song.|0
I watched this movie with big expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.Sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations.|1
Well , after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING , I went into this film knowing that I HAD to take this one for what it was. And, I have to tell you I’m not disappointed in the way this has turned out. In fact, I loved it. I was so impressed and I was actually a bit surprised that Surya couldn’t give us more information on what exactly happened on the set and the rest of what the movie was about. All I had to do was just sit back and wait.|0
Well , here we have a zombie movie that perhaps is n't even being much of a zombie movie . I mean it doesn't have a name I'll tell you what the name of the movie is : The Zombies , The Walking Dead . It's a very well done movie. I'm not going to say it's going to be your typical zombie movie either . In fact there are a couple of things this movie is trying to do that are really not typical . For starters the zombies that are on this movie are not in your typical walking dead fashion .|0
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered up to standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and, the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to he girl, so guess what?! Then the final after-twist I do not know what to think of that.|1
Citizen Kane....The Godfather Part II....D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars as Dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. He clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (I myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive.|1
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window.|1
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off.|1
OK , a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining . Could this film really be a hit with video lovers ? That would be amazing , so I will have to say I was right. So the first trailer of a new video film is out in theaters and I am super excited . It seems to be like something you would watch on Netflix, but at a low budget. That is great and I am definitely looking forward to see this film and I have some questions . For starters who did the cinematography ?|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much . It was a good movie . I thought that since I’m a big fan of Woody Allen , that he should do another movie of that genre , but I had no idea who it was going to be or what he was going to do . I was a little disappointed by it . A lot of people seem to be impressed , but not me . There were a lot of actors that were in it . It was very interesting , but I felt that it was a little weak compared to other Allen’s.|0
It is terrible ! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told them to take as many pictures as they wanted ! What is going on here? What happened to us ? I think the people who did this must be punished very severely. They can charge me for the damage they've done ! They can send me to prison with no chance of parole for the rest of my life ! They could even take away my freedom !! What happened to our rights as a free people ? I want to know what happened to our justice system ?|0
A stupid movie , with a stupid plot . Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender . I have watched this movie a dozen times already , but there are still times when it is so hard to look away . It's just so weird , there is just so much to look at . And I'm not sure if it's the actual story , I don't really know . It seems like it's more of a plot , but at the end I still don't like it . Not sure how to put it .|0
It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. The dialog was unnatural. Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense just wasn't there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen.|1
"I must say , when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site , I figured it was the same kind of thing I see when I go out and buy a ticket to a movie.It's not the kind of film you sit and cry your heart out over, it's a little too much action for your tastes ,but that's just my 2 cents worth. __________________
If it's a good movie I'm seeing, you're going to have to let me sit in the theater afterwards and take it home to my parents and tell them the story behind it."|0
"Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia ""goodness"" in the form of this soft-core Cinemax non-classic.A numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a ""black hole"" as the intelligent dolts put it. Pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. Pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.Ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin."|1
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite.|1
I found this an awfully disappointing experience ! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the bottom of the site. It’s a little more user-friendly and there is no obligation to purchase, though it does take a tiny bit longer to work and requires more time to complete your order. However, I highly recommend this service if you want to keep track of who is visiting your site and whether or not there are new items on sale on your site. I find that it takes a good few minutes to do this and it does give me some idea of what is on offer.|0
I love movies...and rarely do I see a movie that I hate...but this was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. Hands down... I cant believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. AWFUL! Do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful.|1
I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!|1
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal.|1
Thank God I have fast-forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Whatever: It's a stupid cliché. It doesn't make any difference. There's this guy, javier Bardem, who constructs buildings or something. It doesn't matter. He is handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there is a car wreck but I watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? Car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me.|1
I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money ( and time ) I've ever seen in a theater I was not going to go to. This is the kind of film I have been seeing for over 20yrs. The acting is terrible, the script is not even remotely funny, it has zero redeeming virtues, and it is pretty awful as a whole, so I will give this to the DVD rental place and just skip the rental and get the dvd for free ( which I am getting ).|0
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending. (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along.|1
It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this, a movie that appears to have been written not on his own or his vision, but by an over-worked assistant editor. In his defense, I have seen all the Italian versions of this movie and I have to say that they all have very little in common with one another. The plot is simple and repetitive, the dialogue a bit of a slog, and it was the actors’ acting ability that really put this movie down in the eyes of many, including myself.|0
I have just caught this Movie on TCM , and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this story is true!! On Sunday, January 28, 2017 at 8.30pm ET, ABC News aired a report on ABC's Nightline, regarding President Trump's meeting with the leaders of the United Kingdom and France to talk about trade and the EU (European Union). In that report, it was reported that the meeting was held at the White House, and President Trump's meeting with the French President, Emmanuel Macron was not included, and was only attended by Prime Minister Theresa May.|0
"I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago , and it is now making a comeback. It is a bit different from what I had imagined, but what is it ? What is the origin story of this article? Why the name of the piece, and that it was written by someone who actually has the credentials to write it. The title is taken from a quote by George Orwell:

“It is a mistake to suppose that power corrupts, for power tends to create and maintain the very conditions of freedom.” “

A bit of context ?"|0

Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be.|1
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. Then again, are these really suicides? It seems as though there's a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that, making for a very weird looking specter. Recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit.|1
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in its treatment of this Swoon over does it by far. Worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. While it is an interestingly made film, Swoon stinks.1 out of 10 - awful.|1
We get to see who the good guys are. The union. And who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. This is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. The plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. It's boring and pointless.|1
`` The Bone Snatcher '' starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of creature, and the development of several new techniques. The Bone Snatcher is actually one of the more successful pre-Hobgoblin games of recent times. The game has grown so popular over the last several years it has had a name change in the form of Boneshooters: It's no longer called Boneshooters; it's simply called Boneshooters. This is a great name, as it reminds us that, in fact, the game is indeed a real thing.|0
I saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. I just recently found an original VHS version, and purchased it for $125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the Broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.Why, it's just a little over paying for a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release this in DVD form soon. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!|1
"Terror in the Jungle is a real find . If you saw it , you 're one of the few. In late 2009, I stumbled upon this film, and the first thing that came out of my mouth upon hearing about it was, ""How the hell did that come to exist?!"" There is a lot more to it than it first appears. It's been said before, but let's rewind a little to the start of that film: it was the first horror film I'd seen in the theatre."|0
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career.|1
"We are in a small town , a homely widow ( Ida Lupino ) hires a handyman ( Robert Ryan) to fix her bathroom. The only problem is that he is the same guy who broke into her house, and has done so many times before. Now this guy is using the handyman like a piece of garbage to break into Lupino's place. It's clear that he is not a professional. When the handyman shows up, the widow's husband comes to the door and tells him, "" I don't care who you are."|0
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters . This is CITY OF PEACE. I don't care if anyone else has their opinion or views or any other sort of thoughts. I just care what they believe and they believe in what they want. I just care what I feel and what I believe in. What is the problem? We all have opinions and views and none of them are bad. We could all just be happy with our choices. I do not think there is a problem.|0
"I expected a lot more out of this film. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. Bottom line is that ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier.I really like Grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing. The character is designed well, but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think that his character was explained too well. I mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to become a woman."|1
"Simply put , there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out . Part 1 is about my experience of living in America for three years. I have been away for the 3rd year . I moved back to my hometown on July 1st, 2013. There are many things I will miss about America , the people , food , weather . The weather , not so much
but I am happy about the friends that I made back there . I will have the opportunity to start my life over , back to the life I was raised in."|0
well , what can i say . WHAT THE F * * K ? There really is n't much to add to that . They are the type of bands that need to get on stage . If anyone was to see the video i will have a great laugh . I would like to point out two points . First . If you get your ass out of bed on time then you won't fall over . Second . I believe all these people that get their ass out of bed at the right time are not as fit as we are and as a result tend to do more than their share .|0
This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. There are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device.My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. The product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement.|1
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class . This film is what is wrong with the world. If it is that bad then what are all the other bad things that are wrong with the world. There is no problem in the world and the whole earth would be covered in water if everyone just tried to get along with eachother and do the right thing. How can all the people who are so far in the past in history be so stupid and ignorant. The world would be better off if everyone just tried to do what was good to them.|0
In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi (e.g. The Score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. This one apparently demands and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master.I was on the edge of my seat throughout. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of its day.I would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.I cannot give it enough stars.|1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.|1
Eros and Thanatos , Love and Death command the dialectics of Life . By the end of 19th century in Europe, philosophy began to be the basis of scientific and cultural activity and became the major field of activity for philosophy. In 1881, the first conference was held in Paris. In 1882, the first International Congress of Philosophy took place, in Berlin . This congress had two objectives. It was the place to establish the philosophy of logic and philosophy of science and the place where philosophers, scientists or philosophers of science, would come to present their work, which was considered as the most important.|0
Heh ... I 'm surprised this movie still exists in any form , let alone it being available for rent to the public. I still remember that movie from a couple of years ago in a theater in my town and I don't remember anyone mentioning it after it went out of business. It was so bad that I almost walked out during it! There are some things that need to change in the movie industry for all of us out there to have a good time while making money, but for the most part those changes are being put into place.|0
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible . The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny . This movie had to be made at least twice, even though I don’t know if I should recommend it because of how good it was or if I should not because of how bad it was. The most obvious reason why I should not recommend the movie is that it had a terrible title. If a movie’s title doesn’t have a reason behind why it has to be terrible, then it should not be watched, regardless of how good it actually is.|0
This movie was everything but boring. It deals with reality. To the people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor,and i deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage,all kinds of health problems, and death.|1
I watched Love Life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting, but as whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words.|1
Synopsis : the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs , Hannibal is a big budget production that totally failed to deliver on expectations with the most recent Blu-ray and DVD. The film was a huge success back in the 70s and 80s and a massive box office success when released back in the 90s. Hannibal is still going strong with the latest Blu-ray and DVD releases. It was a huge success back in the 80s and was released again in 2001. If you enjoyed the film back then, you’re in for a real treat with a new Blu-ray release that’s out now.|0
"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end."|1
"I caught this on HBO under its category of ""Guilty Pleasures"", and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. One, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn ""who did it"", you think, ""So what?"". However, I must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson get completely naked a number of times."|1
Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed one bit. He is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. This time he has a pal named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end.|1
I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006).This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it).Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!'|1
"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking ""surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on"", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far."|1
OK, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup.|1
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam ( races working together, and so on.) The only saving grace is a few moments of genuine heart-warming comedy, like when one of your characters finally learns how to tell time. I could go on like this all day, but it’s hard to know where to even begin. The only thing to really know is that this is the kind of game that I actually want to play a lot. And I don’t mean as the only thing I play.|0
I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form.|1
"I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and ""perfect"". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film."|1
Without a doubt , the biggest waste of film of the year . This movie is poorly structured , sadistic , uninteresting , and very unspectacular , but that is all that I am going to put into words . There is much more to be said about the film but I will leave it up to the reader to decide for themselves . A few years ago when the film had a chance to premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival I watched the trailer with my wife before watching the film. The trailer was very interesting and I wanted to see more of the film so we decided to check it out the next weekend.|0
If you liked the Grinch movie ... go watch that again , because this was no where near as good as it was originally , I mean I'm sorry for that , but I think this is the only way to explain the movie , that it's so good , that you're actually going to want to take all of the credits out of it and just have it . The acting is great , the story is so well told , that I believe you are going to be satisfied , you will want to watch it again ( and again ) for sure .|0
"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie."|1
"It's complete nonsense. I've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the ""parallels"" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. It's crafted for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.Who made this hit peace? Easy.When all is said and done; Que Bono? That is, who benefits, in the long run?You don't. You sacrifice money and rights."|1
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence . Showing Moses as a murderer . People who use a knife in the hand as a weapon . How far do we go ? Why do we keep using violence as a way to solve problems ? Why is there still so much hatred ? How can we help to stop using violence as a way of settling conflicts? Moses is being held in Egypt in order to have his tongue cut out. How is this justified? Who is the judge? How can a human being have a choice about his death?|0
I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction.|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults . Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the world . “It is a terrible thing to wake up one day and know you’re going to die. It is even more terrible to lie there, paralyzed by fear, knowing you might not get out of the bed in the morning. If you are going to lie there, you might as well face the facts; there’s no reason to be afraid any longer. You’ve got to do what has to be done .|0
"The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability ""to take fragments and make them whole"" affects everyone within her sphere."|1
This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. A must see for all who like Indie and for those who don't. I think this movie will draw more into the Indie scene. The acting was top notch! The character of Alice was portreyed so well. With perfect akwardness. This movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! I think it would do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is untouched by the Hollywood hand.|1
Having worked professionally with young girls on the run , I found this film surprisingly authentic . I would never have been so bold as to say that, but it is true that this film makes the point that children can be very impressionable , and as a result , they can be so easily manipulated or led to believe that their words are worthless. This is why so many stories and books about child abuse are so horrible , and many of them just take away that child's power to be who they want them to be .|0
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead' was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore-I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before watching this.|1
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad. This movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture Christianity as most know it. I am also very surprised because this film is a BBC program and the BBC is quit well known for their quality programing, but it looks like the BBC's attempt to rival the Hollywood psycho/drama films are failing completely. Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion.|1
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought 'I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place.|1
I cant believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. Thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer Simpson making a movie about a doughnut!|1
Loki, Norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad.|1
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. Predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.The staple of roman porno is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh.|1
This film gives new meaning to the term `` uneven '' , giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by some poor camera work. Some of this is unavoidable, as it would be impossible to get a great shot without some sort of distortion, but it's always hard to tell if this is what was intended. In truth the film has a few standout performances, but if this isn't meant to be, there's no doubt that these performances will hold up as well or better in a theater. Though a few of the dialogue is clunky or nonsensical, it still sounds and feels natural.|0
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie . You people encouraged me to do it and I got a huge amount of work from it. So thank you to you all, and please don’t start telling me what a bad movie it was or what is a bad movie. But I want to be fair to everyone. I really do want to apologize for what I have done. I did this because I care about people, and I really want to make this movie a success in the end.|0
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military . When a group of soldiers get captured by aliens and try to escape (with no way to stop them), they must fight to survive and figure out who will survive. The movie begins when a soldier discovers a strange machine on the beach that makes a loud sound and starts to move forward. However, there’s a hitch: it seems that this device was designed to be used in a war. Soon the soldier is attacked by the machine and almost killed as the machine moves the soldier closer to it.|0
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice.|1
This is one of the most laughably bad films I 've ever seen . I can not believe whoever wrote this did not see this. I have had this film for almost two weeks and can not think of what could have made me think it was something so bad. The whole film is very poor and I still don't know why it was made. First of all this is one of the worst films to have been produced ever. The entire production and editing is really awful. The movie itself is so bad that the movie itself just makes the movie even worse.|0
I am an Australian currently living in Japan . I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed with it . It was filmed very well and had a lot of heart . Great acting and a great story line . I watched this film and I had a feeling about it from the very beginning . I loved the movie and I will watch again , this time in Australia . This is an American film. There are several movies in the '60s that have American characters. Most of them are terrible and dumbed down. This film was not like this in the '60s.|0
"Although it isn't mentioned very often, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she's hiding something...This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about, and have sympathy for during the climax, which doesn't happen very often in horror films."|1
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. I didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all.|1
This film was great!Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off.Tasha Smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear Grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.And Oh,I can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.Damn!|1
"Like another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed this multiple times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel ""Return of the Ginat Majin"".Now I haven't seen it since then...but it never left me. Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically it isn't horror...until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. There's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them...to no avail."|1
"""Witchery"" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.The gore in ""Witchery"" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets ""sucked"" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast!"|1
'Don't Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. 'Don't' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd, disjointed, claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty, just plain grubby, for Brownrigg's world is this mad, unwashed, scummy prison cell of rants, obsessions and all shades of mental illness.|1
There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made this movie before, so I would love to see it as a prequel to the Star Wars franchise. This movie can be seen as the first in a trilogy that is set to include the next installments of the series, so I would also love to see what is going to come next. I personally love the idea of an R-Rated movie as a prequel to a classic franchise, so I would like to see an R-Rated prequel if one exists.|0
"1. The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. Ken Shamrock is in it. 3. Ken Shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. It leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. The makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like.

I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now . I enjoyed the movie 's story, and it did not disappoint. My wife and kids liked the film as well, they did not find much to complain with either one. I can say that Grand Champion was a much-anticipated movie which I have now watched over and over again. If you've never watched Grand Champion before, I would highly suggest it. I would like to add one thing, that the film was not only directed by Daniel Myrick, but also the cinematography too.|0
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now , but having just sat down to review it , there is a lot to like about this book , and for a number of people this is a great book , I am going to start by saying I have never seen an author so clearly and succinctly describe a character and I don't think I will ever forget them . It is a pleasure reading this book , and although I have seen others review it as if it is a masterpiece and I don't see that , I will give it my best shot .|0
"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment."|1
"Loosely based on actual events, ""River's Edge"" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.The film begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1)."|1
After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia.

Alone, trusting only in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia.The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill.|1

It's 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So, why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible. Just...don't...watch it. I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child produced this entire movie.|1
"when this show first came to Disney , i love it started watching all the time . It quickly became one of the best shows for the kids and adults alike ..

Disney Junior’s Planes, Incidents, and Extra-Terrestrial Adventure

When Planes, Incidents: Extra-Terrestrial Adventure premiered in 1999, it was the first original Disney television series to be completely created by a Disney animation studio, which was a bold move at the time. Since then the show has spawned three sequels, and three prequels and continuations. So what makes Planes, Incidents so special?"|0
A genuinely creepy ghost story , full of chills and sensuality , this movie just falls short of what it is really meant to do , it is so slow and there is so much blood flowing around , that i just can't handle it and i keep expecting the film to come in and make it better , but still , it just never seems to happen , and i hope that this doesn't mean that the producers are not trying their best to make it happen , but i'm sure it will , because of this , the whole movie feels a bit off and it feels like a bit of a fluff .|0
Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However, I think there is some other problems here.1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e.|1
As Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age, a solid script, and some great Disneyesque songs, and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed, without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.This is simply fun, but it is also a well made, well written, beautifully endearing classic.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.|1
There are movies that are so bad, they're good. Then there's movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. I can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all.|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love and war still happen today. We should not forget that war is still a part of human life and it is still a force that keeps the human race going today. We cannot stop it. It is happening all around us and we cannot change its nature. There is no doubt that we can have a peaceful life even if we have to fight. War is not going away and it will never be defeated as long as we have the desire to fight it.|0
"Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a film with these two together for the first time! Now imagine THE WORST film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to ""Night Vision"". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction."|1
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show . It is so boring . The jokes are the same over and over again that you don't need to repeat . This show has no real storyline or story line . Why does everything happen in this show ? There are so many scenes that don't make sense or have a plot at all . The only good thing about this show is it has the lead actress of the character . Her acting is so beautiful . But this show is so boring . The only good part of this is it has a really cute character .|0
"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. My ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It's formulaic every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the ""dreams can come true"" schtick?"|1
"Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist , helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best , and perhaps unable to defend himself against that same violence . . . ‘He was like a child in need of his mother who would come out from under a bridge and cry “Why have you killed my baby”?’

It was the beginning of February this year when I came across an entry on Wikipedia for a Welsh poet and playwright called Rhys Herbert. He had published his first volume of poems in 1976 and was at that time the poetry editor of the Oxford University Press ."|0
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player.|1
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics , they released Irreversible which I bought on the strength of one of their releases . As I watched the DVD it seemed like I had seen every single one of their discs and had no recollection of ever seeing any of them before and they seem to have done the same thing to each one of their releases over time . As well as their discography there is an excellent interview which was included with the DVD which is worth watching . After watching their DVD I think I need to start watching some of their other releases .|0
Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company. It's a bit silly and a bit boring (which is fine with me, but not my cup of tea). However, I found it pretty enjoyable. Astor is very likable as a down-to-earth woman who tries a few times to make her dream job a reality and succeeds. One of my favorite scenes in the film is the one between Astor and her boss at the paper company. While it seems like an innocent scene at first, it soon turns serious.|0
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of those movies while still being completely different. That's the kind of thing we're trying to do with our new game, 'Sneak Attack'. I've had a chance to check it out today and it is, as I expected, totally awesome. So let me get right into it, shall we? The premise of Sneaky Attack was that you would be on the run and you would have to be sneaky to evade the traps the game had laid for you.|0
"No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being ""naughty"" exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath."|1
CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e.|1
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature . Finally ! ! ! ! ! ! A little bit disappointed by the lack of details given in the article. But then it is not like they are making a movie about a movie , as opposed to a film , so what is the difference? It seems a bit weird to be remade in 3-D ! ! ! ! ! I don't see the connection. I am glad that this movie was made . I would have liked to see the same film but it seems not so good to make a remake !|0
The 1980 's 'My Dinner with Andre , ' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory , is essentially a dialog between Andre and his mentor, Wallace. It is, in essence, Andre's life story told to the reader by the man himself. This was the first time I read an autobiographical piece in a comic book . I found it very engaging . I read it over a period of a month . While there were some flaws in the work that were distracting, the story line was enjoyable . It was a very simple story .|0
This movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good. It is truly appalling. Its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but alas they were serious. Made for TV, but not worthy of even that. It contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh will he save the town from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I cant explain how bad this is. Awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy.|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first ( and probably the worst) people ever to buy one. My Dad bought a T-34 tank and told me if I wanted to get in shape I should get a tank. I told him that I had to buy an aircraft but he would understand that I did not really want an aircraft. But I did not want any more money to get it either. I had to have the thing. But I never thought I was going to have to fight the Soviets to get it.|0
First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing.Second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? They were killed *before* the surgery took place! Third - how the heck did Lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use?|1
Cruddy , innocent .. no smoking , drinking or bikers , but Jeremy Slate ( good actor ) and Jocelyn Ficca ( not so good , and not as good ) .. I would not agree with your assessment of these films . I found all of them to be fascinating . I found the performances by Ficca , and Slate more than adequate . I found the film more than interesting . I would also like to say I really enjoyed the documentary . I would recommend it to everybody who like to watch documentaries . There are many things I didn't like about the documentary .|0
"""Prime Suspect 4"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal."|1
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and monsters. It’s a film that has taken some flak and rightly so, but I’m pretty sure you’d have no problem sitting through it. Predictably, things go wrong in this picture. For example, there are several sequences where you’ll have to hold the volume on at a lower setting to hear the action as it happens. You may notice a few times that your volume may be too high or too low to hear your character(s).|0
I don't understand why this movie was released, it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if an Aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad... boy was I wrong!If anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film.The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, it was the WORST acting in the HISTORY OF FILM.|1
"Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks , I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger up to mute his words, and his face in his lap to record Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean would not have wanted any of this. If the teacher wants to have a voiceover with him, ask to speak directly to Mr. Bean, and say ""Mr. Beans voice-over"". I think that would get him all hot under the collar, but it's not as good as an actual recorded interview. Thank you for sharing your story with us."|0
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that he pines after. In the same unfinished château he built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group.|1
"This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life . While I like how the director tried to make the plot believable it just felt like a very slow movie . I really hope they don’t take it too seriously

I found the beginning very slow, but once the credits were running and we saw the credits of all the movies in the theater I realized that it would not take too long, which I thought made the movie that much more fun and exciting . I would say the first half was a lot better than the last half, but that is just my opinion ."|0
"I can just picture how this movie came to be:""So how else can we screw up our careers?"" ""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place!"|1
We all know that the world is full of dodgy , rip-off horror films . Some of these can be quite good too, such as the brilliant The Blair Witch Project. However, many of these films can be downright awful, which is not surprising because we all know how bad it is. This is particularly true for horror films, but it is still true that some are pretty good. Here are the best horror films you've probably seen this year so far, with the first film being my personal favourite .|0
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu . I just wanted to say that in this video you can see a video I made with my own camera and edited the best I could with no flash, the music and all the rest is my own, no money was spent on it and I would love it if you enjoyed it. I would really like it if you subscribe to my YouTube channel so you don’t miss any part of this video. Please let me know. Thank you.|0
"""Jefferson in Paris"" is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way he was, the film seems to say. End of sentence, end of movie, the door's behind you.After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow)."|1
"Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue shooting the film, he was still very much associated with the local community. This is a film about his time in Australia. So I guess it's only fitting that the film also includes footage of him being interviewed. I've seen the footage from him being interviewed, so I really hope it's true. That would be quite an honour! Saturday, November 16, 2011

I was reading a review of this film and found it really interesting."|0
"Hitchcock 's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of , but also the 'look ' of Anthony Quayle and of his wife, Mavis Turner. For the latter's part she became one of the great movie beauty queens of her time, and it is this quality which was to make her one of the more memorable stars of the period, although she remained an extremely versatile performer throughout the 1960s and 70s.""

the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can't. oh yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now, the shark in this movie is a really fake looking CGI shark.|1
When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget.|1
"Too much stock footage (almost one third of this 53 minute film) really slows this one down. Granted that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say ""Ro-DAY-oh""), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina-- even in the great ""Duck Soup"" [1933]) and the 'heroine' Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hey! it's her sister!)"|1
( WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER ) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of a film’s plot. A story so well thought out, with so many characters, that you want to go back and check them out again. So when you hear the word ‘horror’ or ‘revenge fantasy’ and are told that these are the movies you should check out, you have two choices: 1) go back and watch it again, because it might be a bit of a disappointment and 2) forget about it, because you can probably just watch the DVD instead.|0
A middle aged man, Robert Jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set. He has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with Mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.|1
"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes? ""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash."|1
Well , I did n't know what to expect from 555 . Matter of fact , I had never even heard of them before . But when I received the box , I was amazed . I opened the box , looked at it , and I could feel the power of it. My eyes got blurry . My hands started shaking and I could hear the noise of the vibrations . The box vibrated so much . The vibrations of the box made my whole body start shaking . The box vibrated so loud I could hear my own heartbeat .|0
Dr. Pena ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , a `` crypto-zoologist '' ( fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who think that ``crypto-economics '' is the next big thing ) who makes his living teaching about `` blockchain and its potential applications '' , is a former Wall Street Journal columnist (and a self-styled `` expert '' in this field ) who now lives in Switzerland. His latest book, which was just launched last week , is the most popular book on the subject of blockchain, written by a writer with whom he has worked for more than 30 years.|0
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough . The acting and plot are n't that impressive , but the story and character development was really well thought out , as was the script . I would love to know more about the characters . A few of them I could have easily picked up from the previews , and some of them I'm really curious to see , so I'll probably wait and see if they can pull this one off . Terrance Johnson is such a douche for not being in the movie . This guy needs to go to hell .|0

I can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying).|1
"Writer & director Jay Andrews, a.k.a. Jim Wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-Z computer generated reptiles in ""Komodo Vs. Cobra,"" as generic a rip-off of ""Mysterious Island"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" as you can imagine. The chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilariously awful. However, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable."|1
*****I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean.|1
"1 . The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's head. And it cost him a fortune. All because he was eating them in front of a camera, and nobody noticed. It's time to have a little bit of humility and put this back in the box where it belonged for a few days. After a while, though, I suspect it would become less interesting. Thursday, April 19, 2009

... when we all know, no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of Sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. How disappointed was I! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.However me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style.|1
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre . Vulnerable , naive nurse Charlotte Beale ( Kate Beckinsale ) is the one who finds herself falling for a handsome but sinister doctor ( Sam Jardine ). It’s a classic setup, but it works because of what’s happening between them, and Charlotte is the kind of woman who can handle anything life throws at her. We start with Charlotte’s story – how she comes to be working as an ambulance nurse and why she’s feeling so desperate.|0
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do . I was unimpressed and bored with this film . As a fan of sci- fi movies this film was a complete waste of time and most of what happened was predictable . I would have rather see a film with better acting and more interesting plot than a poorly acted boring film . And I guess that I am a fan of bad acting and bad plot anyway . The director tried to do something new by putting a man in the lead but it failed because the character lacked any emotion . He tried to do something new .|0
I ca n't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website ! Have I been a fan of this movie for awhile but this is another one of those that I think will just go to the big screen ... I was looking into getting into this movie but I can't because I can't see the credits on the TV ... I've seen it on the big screen a few times so far. It's a good action movie with some laughs and some of the best dialogue I've ever heard.|0
... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.All others be warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.The film is good for some laughs though. Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie.2/10 for unintentional comedy.Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.|1
I always loved this film. The music,story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte' after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam.|1
First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot.|1
`` THE KING OF QUEENS , '' in my opinion , is a pure CBS hit ! Despite the fact that I am not in the know , I am really excited about it. It has a great soundtrack . I don't think there have been many of these in the last 15 years. I was lucky enough to have a chance to see this movie in the theater , but I am still on the fence. It was a very well made movie and I really like it. I hope the critics like it as much as I do !|0
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot , or corny acting , then Backdraft is definitely worth a look. If this film is anything other than a straight-up actioner, though, it might be one of the worst things of all time. It’s hard to find anything bad to say about Backdraft. If it isn’t a film about violence, then it probably is a pretty good drama. If it is about violence, and it’s more about violence, then it probably is a pretty amazing film.|0
Oh yeah , this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of `` worst 80 's movie , but I'm gonna say this : I didn't enjoy this movie very much. I mean , if the plot was to make any sense , I would understand the whole thing , right ? But this is a horror movie , I don't see any real horror movie , at all. I think we need to look at the plot more , just to give this movie another chance , but I doubt this film would ever do well at all.|0
Ty Cobb is , by far , the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live . His baseball career is not just his first foray in the big leagues , but the culmination of a decade in which he’s tried and failed a number of different things to get to this point . He’s also a man without a country to call his own , and that has a lot to do with Cobb’s attitude. The ‘Nasty’ guy. It all began in 2008 , when Cobb joined the Texas Rangers as an intern .|0
"Not as bad as ""Billy Bathgate"" but close. Try as he might, Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. The other actors don't fare as well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft."|1
After some quite OK Dutch action flicks, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He isn't a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. But even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told.|1
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster!|1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece.|1
"This movie was a disappointment . The story is essentially The Shining with a castle ( or a very cheap one , but I'm not going to complain, it's not like it's a huge castle ). The plot of the film is that there is a curse , and there are two main types of people - the good , who want to get out of it , and the bad . The bad people are the "" evil people "" ( they aren't all evil people , but there are two of them ) who want to keep it, and who will kill to get out ."|0
"This was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea .. However , it was just a little slow and uninteresting, and some of the characters could be more interesting and entertaining. I saw this in the movie theatre and the film was good , but it did take me a long time. It was worth the time though ! 1

This was a disappointing horror movie based on a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it was a little long, the characters were too similar to previous films and the plot didn't quite work out for me as I was expecting more from this Poe based film."|0
I had n't planned on leaving a review , but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie made me start writing, so I didn't have much to say other than it sucks. The main reason I don't like this is because of the acting. They all suck, but if you can accept all of these bad reviews then I guess I don't need to go into it any more. Let me know what you think in the comments, and if you haven't watched this you should!|0
"Dear reader , Watch out ! This movie is not really a movie , though its creators have the impertinence to call it such , but more like a short story

Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.As per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that's gotta count for something!|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. Only living. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. To see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the movie, are desensitized.|1
I have n't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III . Both shows sold out, which means you can now sit and see it live for free. I love seeing a movie in my home town! And it's the first place I know of I'll be seeing this movie when it comes out on May 18th. I'm looking forward to it. Also I'm not a big fan of watching movies in the dark. I haven't been this out of town in about a month.|0
"`` The Cave '' got released more or less simultaneously with the English film `` The Descent '' , directed by Robert Wise . It has the same story line as `` The Cave '' , although we don't get much about the actual location except the mention that it was "" located about 20 miles to the northwest of San Diego ."" This is actually the site of the town of Chula Vista , so the film could have been set anywhere in the vicinity of Chula Vista. - '' '' It was shot at the Cinecolor Studios in Burbank, Calif."|0
"""Strike Force"" or ""The Librarians"" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie."|1
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged?No.But that is not saying much.Like perfume on a pig.Seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.He lands in Prison and is befriended by a Gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.Its good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas it seems. Then an eastern European territory as usual.|1
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout?|1
I hate to admit it, but they were right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone.|1
`` Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own '' , while that may be the case globally, it can't be said here in the USA. I can't think of any other country who has so much talent. However, there are things that Japan does not do well, and one of those is actually starting to show itself. There is one thing that Japan has that other countries don't, and that it is creativity. Japan does it well, but it seems like they are not giving credit where it's due.|0
A traveling couple ( Horton and Hamilton ) stumble onto the town of Gatlin , where kids have slaughtered the locals in one of their number’s name . . . . I have been asked by various readers of my blog to share some of my adventures in this town. . It is a sad day in Gatlin. As many of you know, my great-uncle was one of my first victims when I started attending school here a year ago. I hope to get to visit my great-grandmother who was born and lived in Gatlin a number of years ago.|0
"Bought for £1 , Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Wooden acting , over done CGI , boring story , boring characters . If you like the idea of vampire movies , please watch this movie and leave the comment . For some reason , this movie looks so bad that I can actually imagine watching it alone. Project Vampire has been described as ""Vampire movies"" , but in the UK, it is more popularly referred to as ""Blood movies"". I don't really understand what they meant, but whatever it is ."|0
When I was five years old, it was my favorite television show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday. The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day now, I learned something new with Paula and Janis.|1
I love the way he experiments . Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and Anirban as I do, they have an interesting way of playing music . It is interesting how the two composers are so different and so similar . I can’t decide whether I love them or hate them . The way they play the violin and viola is so unique . The music they make is very unique and yet very similar . I love everything about the two compositions . I really like the way they experiment with the different approaches .|0
"I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of ""five stars!"" on that Attack of the Show show. Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie."|1
Please do not go see this . I did have several laughs throughout this movie , but they were all with people sitting in the balcony seats and the audience standing in line . It did go a little over the time line . Also i have no idea when the film was made , as i was there when it was made . I will admit that there are a few funny moments , but nothing you will really remember . But it's great . If you are interested in any of the people on the movie , check this out .|0
"Better than average World War II-era ""who-dun-it"" featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. The link to ""courage"" is not particularly clear.This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels murder."|1
I 've tried watching it twice , though I have n't been able to make through either episode . For one, I found the storyline to be very weak , which is rare for me and the reason for my dislike of the show is that , it seems like all I can think is that the characters are just too weak for the show . I thought it was the same thing with season 1 of the show . So , after watching it I thought , maybe , it will be better in the end . But I guess I was wrong .|0
"Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word ""STUPID"" over and over again? Probably.This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just excused myself and walked out."|1
"What I got was something better.Just like many movies I've commented on as of recently, I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, ""Blue Spring"" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. I loved the trailer for ""9 Souls"", and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why.This movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else."|1
Now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz.|1
I first saw this movie in the theater . I was 10 . I just watched it a second time and i think I am going to like it. I had never heard of the movie until i saw it . Its a really good one . You can watch it online or on dvd or whatever . You can download the dvd and put it in your computer or laptop for free and watch it on your dvd player or whatever device . What I think is cool about this movie is that most people dont get to see the story .|0

One of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. What is just as bad is their inability to FEEL anything about it.Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget.|1
After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). Porn-movie level acting. Cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.Costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any minute.Nothing to really recommend in this film.|1
"...""Flight of the Living Dead"" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ""I'm a producer, can'tcha tell?"" Thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because I feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. Apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-DVD release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like Richard ""Three O'Clock High"" Tyson, Erick ""Stargate"" Avari, and Raymond J."|1
Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent which is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. At least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor.|1
While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged.|1
It 's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of a working budget could pull off a project that would seem to some as if it were going to take them to the moon. But here's the rub. As it happens I had the pleasure of speaking to a number of people who are film fans, writers, directors, production managers and all manner of other types. And in many cases, the people who are actually doing the work of making films and the people working behind the scenes are just as enthusiastic and committed as the film makers themselves.|0
This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence . As a network, the station was so bad, it could be argued that the cable channels should be cancelled, as it didn't help the industry to attract any customers. It's just plain sad for us, and I feel like there's so much work I have to do from now on. I know there are others on here that feel the same way, and I hope that someday I will be recognized as someone that can help us.|0
"This telecast of the classic musical `` Sweeney Todd '' does not do the production justice , but is still a terrific musical, and very entertaining. As the story progresses the movie goes back in time in the form of some of the early songs from `` Sweeney '' and the later scenes show the progression of this character from his early days on the streets to his days in the orphanage. The musical number \"" \"" \"" \"" \"" begins with \"" \"" Sweeney\"" and the audience is made aware of this character from the earlier scenes."|0
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.I couldn't have been more wrong.This movie was just awful. I don't recall a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I've wanted my money back. You will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags.|1
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do.|1
I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool . The DVD case touted so-and-so (somewhat of course) but the movie in question looked awesome. I haven’t yet gotten my copy, but the movie looks like a great time, especially considering I’ll probably see it soon. The only problem is I can’t remember how it ended. Maybe it was during the movie that I went to bed? The plot is a little convoluted, so if I am correct, I may be in for a real headache.|0
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan, I collect his movies and so far has get to 60. But I´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. But hey that´s why I like him - he is entertaining.But this one has to take the price, I can´t stop wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and also Corbin Bernsen to the picture.While Bernsen is plain awful (I really don´t like him), Roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn´t mean much).|1
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , I feel that it has been over done in comparison to the original. This is because it is a remake and not a prequel and that is why it was made a prequel and not a sequel. In this film there are more than a few familiar faces and it has all the hallmarks of being a great action movie. That being said it does have some flaws and this article is about those flaws. I think there are enough faults to write a whole separate article about them.|0
I do n't care what anyone else says , this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film in history. You can blame the directors, but you have no evidence. No matter what you say, you don't care, and you still don't care enough. No matter what anybody says, you don't care enough, so what else are you going to say when they say something you won't like, you're still going to get up in anger. And if the director doesn't like the result, they should be fired as well.|0
"OK....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted info on the front. I am a programmer from a North American fest, and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away Moscow/Karlovy Vary interface.Straight away I thought ""this film is not for us"" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. Well, well, well."|1
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through . It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rose, whose husband and children are all dead. She has a new husband who is not strong at all, and she struggles to raise the children as a single parent. The film focuses on her journey from the loss of both children to the eventual reunification of both families. It is a drama about a man who wants to be a father to his daughter and son, but can’t get it together to be with his own wife and child.|0
"I can just picture how this movie came to be : '' So how else can we screw up our children's future?"" That's exactly why this is the wrong place to discuss it. As a Christian, I feel a bit uncomfortable discussing a movie that has not yet been shown to a full audience. So while I can understand that it is important to let the movie speak for itself before discussing it, it is also important to let the people who have actually made the movie take the time to tell their story."|0
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film : I love Park Chan-Wook 's work, but he has a tendency to make some questionable choices. For example, he did not really bother to research the historical accuracy of the film and how it came to exist, or how the story actually relates to other films. I'm also not sure if it was a mistake to leave out the backstory about the character, but I would still have liked to know about his past. So in a nutshell, it's not for everyone.|0
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who went off the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck?|1
Dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS!!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. Due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. No one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. This should be a crime and.... I cant believe you would ruin a book like that.|1
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. It is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.Connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot. Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). A marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.|1
Oh , there are many worse Wayne movies . This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element and that’s what you need . I saw the first half of the movie. It is still very funny but not as fun as the first one . I enjoyed the first one but the second one was better. I thought the plot was weak . But I still liked that movie . You need a good comedy for a comedy movie to be successful . My suggestion is to avoid comedy movies and try to watch movies with a message .|0
"""Cat In The Brain"" is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director Lucio Fulci's most notorious years of film-making. The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than that, he casts himself as the star, the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. ""Cat in The Brain"" is not about presenting a clear story and following it."|1
I saw this movie once a long time ago , just once , and I did n't know where it was originally from , I guess I saw it maybe 10 times , because it made me laugh so hard that I forgot it was in English and I was so angry that I had to repeat it for the rest of the movie and that I still have not figured out why I was laughing like that , when it was supposed to make me cry like that , I was in high school at that time , so I wasnt that young to know what it meant .|0
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. It's honestly that bad. I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite.|1
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who have grown up around a family of men who have abused and abandoned them. And I think it shows that we have to hold ourselves accountable for what we do to the next generation, or we will keep on doing the same thing to ourselves. It’s true, I know that. But I think that what happens in this movie is an important lesson, and something that we need to try to remember and think about as well.|0
Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius.|1
"This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors (""Death On The Nile"", ""Evil Under The Sun"") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat."|1
Do n't get me wrong this was fun to watch . It has some nice animation with exception of an awkward moment near the end when one of the kids in his family starts crying when he gets a call on a phone and all of his relatives tell him to go get it and he cries harder and harder. There were some good character moments and a few funny moments in there. But it just lacked any of the depth we've come to love in some of the more recent animated shows. I'm a bit disappointed with what I've seen.|0
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer.|1
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy , self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book, I started making films in the horror genre that were a lot darker and more serious than what you’d find on screen. And what’s worse, these were also much more popular than I could ever hope to be known as. I got to thinking that maybe it was time for me to try and change my path and do something a little different, to prove I’m better than I was. I thought I would do a dark and brooding horror film.|0
To tell you the truth , I do not speak Tamil , and I did not understand the film . But I liked it . But I felt the film should have made more impact . It is the kind of film that works for all age range . I was amazed by the director , directorial style , story line, direction, dialogues etc . Till the time I have watched the movie , I could not find the meaning of the story , and the meaning should be added in the future . It should be added that I did watch it and was very impressed .|0
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden , then we should take this stinker down and make a movie about his capture, because if we do not, he is probably dead. So, here are my top 5 ways to get bin Laden. Top 5 ways Osama Bin Laden was captured. 1. He did not die as a result of interrogation and he is in a safehouse somewhere in Pakistan. 2. Bin Laden is in Pakistan and does not live there. 3. The Pakistani government is complicit in the assassination. 4.|0
I'd liked the Takashi Miike films I'd seen so far, but I found this pretty disappointing. I'd bought it, but I won't be keeping it.I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has just two episodes. In the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by TV static.|1
When I was a little girl , I absolutely adored The Swan Princess , it was reliving the same fairy tale that my older sister and I had seen and listened to growing up , and we all adored that film . but then one of the sequels came out , and my heart dropped into my feet , because I realised the film was going to become yet another remake , with the same original actors . now , I have to ask you , is there a reason I should watch the original again , rather than see a new version ?|0
Oh man, this movie was toe-cringing bad. Bad look, awful story...the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie.Yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it. You can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting, that was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a couple of over-the-top sequences obviously.|1
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid . I loved it . Whilst watching it with my son yesterday we had a great discussion about all things horror . We both watched it again , the next night , and we both agreed that we have never watched this movie with my son . The movie starts out pretty strong , and it’s not long before things get very dark . I’d say about 10/15 of the movie , but we were in a rush to watch it again .|0
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I too, had liked Russell and Pare ""back in the old days"" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I did return to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded."|1
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.|1
Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother.|1
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) FX was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. As is typical with these D movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. Hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really really big step down from Babylon 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' It was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also.|1
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand.From the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre, a shark powers towards us, predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey. It is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes.Our ears on the other hand, are not given the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet.|1
This film is bad. Not so bad it is good. Just bad. It is however hilariously bad. I watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other Chuck Norris film ever again. If you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).It is a constant depression to me, as I grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10.|1
For once a sequel to `` The Karate Kid '' without Ralph Macchio ! Hilary Swank did an excellent job with Ralph, but he was not the most exciting thing about it. I liked the story, but I feel like Ralph is the least of my problems. So I decided to re-watch it and see how I liked it. The whole thing was too slow, and the ending was a little disappointing, but I think they will do it right. I can't wait to watch it with you. I watched it on the weekend.|0
I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film.|1
This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen . Probably `` Okul '' is the most impressive film that you can make in the history of movies. If you are working on this film you should think about doing the same with the other two films too . This was a very difficult film to make especially with the technical aspects . This film is a must see in all of your movies ! I will be reviewing and posting my review after the film . It has to be a must see film as it has everything you want in it and more .|0
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film . Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat was in it , but the film as a whole was awful . What was even worse is the fact that the movie was released on a Saturday morning. That's when the movie goes off the rails . I have to say , that's the worst movie that I have seen in the past few years. It wasn't the worst film I've seen, but it was the worst film I've seen all year.|0
I do n't understand why this movie was released , it looked like something that you show your mates after a drinking session in pubs or clubs or something . I understand there was only one girl that had the chance to meet him in a pub but I don't understand how she managed to make a good impression . This film was really interesting . The only complaint that I have to make is that there was too much sex . It was a bit too much . There was no real intimacy in the way that there is with many of the gay films.|0
I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me , but I think I have an idea : one of my favorite films is Surveillance and, at a point in my film career, I wanted to create a series of videos, one of which was based on this movie. It took a bit, but it was possible, I think. I don’t think this film would be a very appropriate movie to watch for anyone else, so I would suggest that you not watch this if you don’t want to.|0
"i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up. (got introduced to the doctor by way of John Pertwee)as well as ""camera copies"" of doctor who sent to America by UK fans to their US counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the CONs, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it."|1
"go get your camcorder , your little brother , and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on your face.”

Now, you know why that’s a bad image. But you also know something is going to happen to you, and if it’s not a horror film you’ve been waiting for, you probably shouldn’t be looking for it. You’re going to have to learn a little more about horror and how to take the best of it when you experience it. And that goes for movies, as well."|0
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know.|1
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself (which has, at one point, two scenes that are, at a glance, two minutes long). And, since it's made in the '90s, it is also, unfortunately, very, very cheap: $10 per ticket to see it. Still, the movie is a fun, low-maintenance horror comedy, if you like that sort of stuff, and I've enjoyed it quite a bit in the past.|0
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness. The only exception being if they are killed by a cop. I have even seen gangsters run in circles, turn their heads, and run back the other direction when the police show up. I was in Sicily in the mid-1990s when one such guy was killed for going to the police station and telling them that a fellow had stolen his gun. The cop looked over his shoulder and then just laughed at the guy and shot him in front of the entire crowd of people.|0
"This has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. The ""special effects"" ( Spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. I have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end."|1
All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil.|1
Chris Morris ' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints , both from the audience and from management, but with the show now nearing the halfway mark in season 6, it’s time to put the complaints to rest. With that in mind, now is a great time to look at some of the highlights from this season. To begin with, it was always a case of “see you later” when talking about how much this show has improved, and this is no different, even if some of the criticisms of Brass Eye TV have been valid throughout this season.|0
Ok , when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations . Yes , the acting is bad, the story is horrible , I was expecting it to be very good , and the plot line was very interesting . Well , this was one of the worst disappointments I have experienced . I can't even say how disappointed I was , because I was expecting a good thriller . I've never been disappointed by a movie like this . I have read all of the review I've come across , and they all say that this is a very original story that could have made a good thriller .|0
Set in Venice mainly on the Lido , Visconti 's `` Death in Venice '' is a triumph of filmmaking in its own right , and for that the film has won the best director prize at Venice Film Festival twice. The movie is also a major success commercially and is among the best films of this year. The film has a worldwide gross of $9 million, and the total attendance of the film's 3 days in the US was about 10.7 million. The director's career began in 1960s when he was a graduate student at NYU , and he got a job directing a short film for the Student Union .|0
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line . Navy Commander Chuck Prescott ( Marshall Thompson ) has developed the ability to project himself into anyone’s head, but this ability makes him very difficult to pin down and kill, so his friends at the US Marine Corps find themselves forced to rely on him to protect them from their former comrades. They have no idea that the enemy they face is also Chuck’s former brother-in-law. Chuck learns that he has enemies in his own camp: the people closest to him, but not his wife.|0
"Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with ""real live"" native dancers. It's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). Throughout the film, Emanuelle is going after every man she meets."|1
It 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . The dialog was unnatural . It was like they were trying to act like teenagers . But that aside, this film is a complete mess. The actors just didn't have enough to make this film work . It didn't help that they had bad writing and terrible direction . If you love this film, you have to see it from the other end of the screen. There's nothing to look at or anything to enjoy . It's a film that's hard to watch .|0
Still have n't read a single Dan Brown book , but I watched all his movies adaptations . I woouldnt have any trouble finding it. I have seen his first one in the theater (I didnt like it so much), I have also read it, I have also seen the tv series and some of the movies but I must admit they have a different story line and I cant see why they are all the same. I am glad you like them. I dont know if it is because I watch them all or not.|0
this is an alright show to watch , its not the best nor the worst . I 've watched it twice, once on cable, once on VHS, and once on DVD . It also came in a special edition DVD box that also came with 2 DVDs. I have not seen it on dvd anywhere . I can vouch for the acting , scenery , music . I will say the ending is very predictable and the ending in this show is the best ending to any tv show I've seen in a long long time . And I also think that is the worst ending to television ever .|0
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. Yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles.|1
This movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I am talking about. That kid's vicous! Although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity.|1
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home ? How does it get there ? I'm trying to set up a DVD to play at night so it doesn't matter how often I take it out of the case and put it on the DVD player or on a hdd and I can't figure it out ! Does anyone know how it's done ? I have a similar question but I don't get it. How does this thing get to my DVD player at home ? It's no biggy but it must get there.|0
I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino.|1
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through.|1
Once again Bronson 's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which ( uncut ) is far from a great movie but I did find it very entertaining, especially if you like to watch films like this one. I have never seen the original 1984, so I just went with this remake that is more about plot, and some of the performances. The original 1984 had a very simple plot, but this one has more plot twists and turns. I am glad to see a remake of this movie is made, so this can go on the big screen for many more years!|0
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. One definite plus is how it was filmed. Set in Morrocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion is filled with stirring images like the Great Raisuli on horseback especially. The cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal.|1
"Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a film. This looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.The ""talents"" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. I live in Malaysia, BTW.Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. And unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked."|1
The submarine used was NOT Varangian ! 'It ' was in fact two boats , P614 and P615 , both built at Kiel 's Flugstofftechnik 's ( Flottilienz ) plant. They are of the same construction, but P614 was the first to be successfully tested. It had been given a very special role. The German submarine, which had been in service since at least 1941, did not want to be forgotten. Therefore, it was decided to place the P614 in an isolated area of the Mediterranean, near Malta in order to keep it from the enemy's eyes.|0
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! This has got to be one of THE worse movies I've EVER seen! I do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as I watched it!|1
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I didn't want to watch it, but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime.They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated more.Not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around.|1
"THE OTHER is a supposed ""horror"" movie made during the 1970s. It is not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, which starred Nicole Kidman.The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as ""the game"". One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be ""good"". The other one - Holland - is supposed to be evil.The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel."|1
A antique shop-owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley(Valerie Alston)gets put on a US District Court jury, on a trial of a known Mafioso Armand Asante(Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of Pirone attempting to get Whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. Much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with Willam Hurt as the go-between. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable.|1
One of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as a implied Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in McDonalds.Hitler isn't mentioned by name, since America wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!There seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's.|1
"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical ( or Torah ) portrayal of Islam, the best way to go is to read a book of Torah yourself. Here’s why:

1) It’s much harder to argue with your own people than it is with others: They know better. You can never be sure if they’re actually reading your arguments or just playing along with you. 2) If they do actually read your argument, they will likely believe it, since they have so much religious trust."|0
"I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. I would recommend this to people who are looking for something more challenging than they have to be. As always, a solid production. Randy

I saw this film in the theater and was a little disoriented at first with the dialogue that seemed to be going over the heads of most of the cast. I found it hard to understand all the dialogue, but once I started watching the scenes I realized that they were so well written and acted that you couldn't fault it for any of the problems."|0
I find it amazing , that so many people ( probably Poles ) have voted for this movie , giving us so much freedom to make a film like this. Thank you , thank you for the support. Thanks also for all comments , questions. I’m glad there are some who like it . This film was my first Polish production, and I am very thankful to all involved in this production , including the people I worked with during the whole process of shooting and the ones who helped to edit the film.|0
"This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in downtown L.A. I never got to see it before it’s screening but it was a big draw for me with it’s great cast and storyline, I am so glad it didn’t come before! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves film noir!”

“Wow what a fantastic film this was. I had not heard of this until now and was very pleasantly surprised as this film blew me away with it’s outstanding cast."|0
"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it."|1
...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves.|1
This great film never showed up in my town , so actually I did n't have any opportunity to watch it , because it was banned for some time in the country where I live , so it's a bit difficult for me to find the original . I hope you enjoy it! It was one of the films I missed, because I lived abroad, but it was on the big screen here. There was an American version called The Best of Enemies , and there's a German version . I don't know whether it's worth watching the original, but you can't really complain.|0
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat ' characters were sometimes irritating . Only through the miracle of internet streaming service do we have the show now. And now we have the season 2 premiere episode. It is the season premiere, which is always cool. But this season, a few things need to be addressed and I feel like I should address these things. So if you are watching the season premiere, or want to see what is to come, let me know, and give me your thoughts and suggestions, I am always open to anything.|0
In my opinion the directing, editing, lighting, and acting(minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. I wasn't expecting much, in way of camera angles, sound, etc, but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all.After seeing the film, I personally felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another. And I felt like the Travis(Franco) character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after Terri commits suicide.|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great.|1
I think Trash really sucks. I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I haven't seen that kind of c**p at the cinema since Female Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; it really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But actually I am glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion on it. One should see this film, even though it stinks.|1
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into.|1
"This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, Mishima. It jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective."|1
I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.The woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a great job playing the role. I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it.|1
"within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but i wanted to get to the bottom of it all and find out what had happened as well as hear what he had to say to her. i felt like i knew him. ""I've watched it many times but can never seem to catch a break because I never do anything. I've been there for so long and I've seen this, but never knew it existed."" In my opinion this is a very important film."|0
I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films . Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in the late evening and are pretty entertaining for a couple of laughs. One thing about these fight films, they are very, very long. Some of the films have over 3 hours of screen time in them! That's not what I like about them. I like the idea of people getting paid for it, but for $2 a minute, I don't know how it's gonna go over, especially with such a large budget.|0
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto, Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie.|1
Well , this movie is really `` PLUMPED '' HAHA Get it ? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie that i am gonna hate it . I mean all of the girls are gorgeous and they have great expressions on their faces . However , i really don't like most of the songs that they are singing . And ofcourse , i find it boring . I really do . The acting is also bad , they do have great songs but not to the extent as this movie shows. All in all , if you are into these movies . You will really enjoy this movie .|0
I mean , come on ! This movie had such nice potential but it 's like they ran out of money and then they threw it all away like that. It's a shame , because I really liked that movie ! I think that it had some amazing performances , but unfortunately I couldn't finish the movie . I think it was a pretty good movie , but unfortunately , I just couldn't do anything more with it . Maybe it was the movie itself , maybe I just had bad expectations . Either way , I didn't get much of the movie , but I can still enjoy it .|0
Hey guys and girls! Don't ever rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the Oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc.|1
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic.|1
... out of this movie.Sorry to say , this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival . Our copy did not make it to you but this review is going to give you some more background information and give you a little taste of what you’ll be experiencing.There are a couple of ways to look at the film . The first is a simple one but it is one of my favorite things and this is one of the reasons why it’s the movie of the year . The second is a more analytical view and it’s one of the reasons I’m a big fan of movies .|0
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired.I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.Well done Alex Frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing.|1
Susan Sarandon . She made this movie for me . I 've never appreciated her acting more than as I did with her in it . this is actually an excellent movie . Sara is just great . She has such a lovely character . I 'm very pleased with her performance . I'm very, very glad I watched it . It will be one I will rewatch . there are a couple of minor things I wish she'd added more of in the movie but she's really got so much depth . I do, however, have a complaint that she doesn't give the character much character in her character .|0
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. The story behind one of them is as intriguing as any of the other tales in the series. This film is a remake from the original movie “Arabian Nights” in which the story was adapted for cinema. Filmmaker and screenwriter Aziz Ghobadi says he made the original film because “I thought the movie did not have much to show but it had the power to change people’s perceptions of the movie.|0
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. As I walked up the stairs to the balcony, all the lights went out and it began raining outside. I took my umbrella and stepped out into the storm to see a movie I didn't expect it to be much of a comedy. I had no choice but to stay in bed for about two hours because I didn't want to get soaked while I waited for the light to come on so I could get some sleep.|0
"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see""."|1
This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a 10 if I have bought the DVD, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the Oscars.|1
I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script.|1
Ice the Limerick : A virus pulled out of the iceJust did n't know how to play nice.If infected you will have no chance. I'm sure I read some years back about an Irish person who found a lump in her breast, and then the lump grew, and after a couple of months the person thought it might be the same lump, but then the lump grew bigger. She didn't know how it grew or how it was spread. How did this happen? And what is the virus? And why did the person die? Click to expand...|0
Like some other people wrote, I'm a die-hard mario fan, and I loved this game. This game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it!Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's that good!)|1
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique combination of politics, history and suspense, it is an interesting series to look forward to in 2014. However, as you can imagine, the series’ success has also created a lot of attention on the series. The series was not always that successful for Turkey. When it first released on Turkey, it was a low rated series with low viewership. But now, the series has been seen on Turkey’s largest television network (Zorlu), and has become popular in its second season.|0
"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the ""actors"" (With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the ""performers"" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The ""New"" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!)."|1
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) had first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. The film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one.|1
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous . The scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting is weak , the dialogue is incoherent and the characters are all over the place . The story is a farce and you will want to leave after seeing it . I rated this movie a 1 , and that is too bad , the acting is not bad , the dialog is good and the special effects were very well done . The story is just weird , and if you were a fan of the movie you will get bored very fast .|0
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I decided to give it a chance and see the movie. I was a little bit nervous because I am not very familiar with the film and didn’t know the details of the cast or anything. Well, I was not disappointed as the movie was well worth the effort. This movie is well worth seeing if you are a first-time film viewer. The cast of the film is great, which made for a fun movie experience.|0
"Wow , Stella Shorts are great ! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella , the TV show . I thought , “what the heck ? I should make them myself!” So , here we go :

Materials needed are a pair of elastic band scissors , scissors , a pair of elastic cutters or a pair of scissors , scissors , an empty bottle and glue , glue , glue , glue . How to make these ? First, you need a pair of scissors. I got this idea from a TV show, they always talk about sewing with elastic bands , I just didn’t have any scissors ."|0
One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with `` Only for big fans of the lead actors or something of the like, the movie might just be good, but for most fans, it's the kind of movie that they'd rather go see on DVD. It really is a great film, if you get to see it. It's a tough, tough movie to describe, but I don't know that I can really lay it all out in two words. I'm kind of trying to say it's kind of like a movie that has some sort of cult following.|0
"Just a great soundtrack . Really enjoyable music . Outstanding cast , great lead performance . Worth watching.Does n't really need a new release, but you will be impressed with the talent involved , the way the film was produced and the way they captured the essence of each of the characters. A must watch ! Great movie and I have never heard of any of the main characters! This is one of those movies where you think ""What the hell?"" and then go in expecting to find it to be just as great as the first movie in this series."|0
Well , I think I 've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie ! I read the review in the NYTimes, but I don 't feel that I can comment on that aspect of the movie. I have not watched the movie yet, but have been trying to get a hold of it. I will watch it, but if I am feeling brave enough, I will watch it as I am writing this.I am in my mid 40's , so maybe it will not hold up to my standards as well as some of the previous movies I have seen .|0
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is . Everyone loves it . I'm sure that it will be a big hit . This is another great film, but it doesn’t stand out from the rest like the others. It's a bit predictable . Some of the acting is pretty good, though, and I have to wonder how many times they used the word “silly”. I think it's a classic of the '30s, and it has its own problems. But it's worth a viewing.|0
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city. A low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. The finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then.|1
"""Disappointing"" is the best word I could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the US athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced.What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?"|1
Okay , that was just brilliant . I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong . I can just imagine how awesome this would’ve been if the first 10 episodes were this incredible . And I think you could see that as well . I have to believe that this has all of Season 1’s power and that’s awesome . I don’t know when or why Season 1 was canceled , but I always knew I would be waiting for Season 2 . How can you not watch a season of TV like this?|0
I can see that the ratings for this film are n't all that high for this film , so I'm hoping that with the next installment I might actually see this film in a theater. A few of my friends on the internet have seen this film and they say that it's quite good, which I found to be true. I'm a huge fan of Star Trek and when it comes to Star Trek, I can see why they put this film out. So if it isn't a fluke that I'm going to see it, I'm going to take my chances on it.|0
"There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something I found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, ""Smoooooookin!"" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe?"|1
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable.|1
"I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says ""I miss Elizabeth but I ache for Grace"". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!!"|1
Philistines beware, especially American ones! This has all the elements you'll hate - a langorous approach to film language, a painterly sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well... If, however, you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of MTV/TV Commercials, then watch this.|1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then I could have gone for the ending. I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene.|1
Okay , When I bought this flick I though this got ta be the ultimate b-movie , space monkey landing , I don’t recall this being said , and I think you’ll find the same thing , as well , when you watch this , the first one , this movie was very well edited , I’d rather watch the first one , than watch this movie , so I hope you all like the movie , and I hope you all see it on your TV . What is this movie , the name of the movie ? What is the name of the main character ?|0
Being a former MST3k watcher, even I found this movie unwatchable. The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow--they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a couple of bucks and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent pieces of film-making I've ever seen and that's saying something.|1
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch . With such a super cast , it 's a shame that it is not more widely available . But the film is worth the effort to find it . I 'll give it a chance , hopefully it will be enjoyable . It does seem to have been done before . There was a remake , which I saw and found to be somewhat interesting , but not worth a review . And of course , there 's always the other remake . But this remake seemed like a good movie . And it is , from what I can gather , a good story .|0
11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb . There is a ton of criticism on it. I was not surprised to read about some negative reviews, I have had several. I have had many negative reviews for the movie and some positive ones. There are many different opinions here, it’s not a big secret that a movie is judged by many people. Some see it as a joke, others love it or hate it. I personally think it’s an interesting film.|0
This movie was outright painful for me to watch . I understand that indie films do not have the same critical cachet as Hollywood movies. But it seemed so out of place and at times it was hard to understand why any film would even make it this far out of theaters. I was so unhappy that I left it. I’ve seen movies like this before, especially by Hollywood, but never anything by independent. It’s a shame I didn’t get to see this one. The story of this movie is really really bad.|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS, no mater how expensive they were.|1
This isn't exactly a complicated story. It's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. Claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. Those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. With Goya's Ghosts this doesn't apply.|1
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself.|1
"I watched the this the other night on a local station because I did n't feel like watching tripe like that lol. I'm actually glad I never watched it, cause I feel like I got spoiled by it in high school. When I was about 12 or so, I watched it one night, and I was like ""Whoa, this isn't even bad, this is pretty good"" lol, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't the best movie I'd ever seen. But I thought it had some good stuff in it and the music was very catchy."|0
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in New York City in 1890s, but who after their freedom decided to return home to help the cause of freedom. The Black Freedom Theater was started to provide the opportunity for African-Americans and other marginalized groups to act in concert with the civil rights movement. It would be one of the first black theater groups in America. It began with a small group of eight black and one white volunteers and lasted for seven years.|0
"Thankfully you don't need a lot of ""book learnin"" to understand where this thing's going... Obviously a poverty row cash-in on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable George Zucco in another of his patented ""mad doctor"" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job."|1
A group of four young men , attending a prestigious private school , belong to an old covenant that was born out of a religious revival of the 19th century. While the men were in school and college, a series of crises were unfolding in South America that would change the religious landscape of the continent and in turn alter the history of the Western Hemisphere and the Americas in general. The four young men of South America were also young men, but their time in South America was different. They were college students, and their time in South America was different from what their American peers were used to.|0
"What an utter disappointment. Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead. What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane? ALL the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for ""lowest common denominator"" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people."|1
`` Mr. Bean '' , starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson , was a huge hit during its run in the mid-90s. In the mid-aughts, the character came into his own as a guest-starring character, such as on '' Scrubs , '' where he was played by comedian/actor Larry David . The character also came into its own on the hit sitcom '' Family Guy , '' where he and his son Fred were played by actor Neil Patrick Harris and his two sons by actress Kristen Schaal , a.k.a. Fred and Stewie . However, Mr. Bean did not appear again on the show, which ended after season 2 in 2004.|0
"GOLD RAIDERS (1951)A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, who I've always enjoyed as the ""third Stooge"") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting."|1
Put simply , this mini-series was terrible . Let me count the ways . 1 . Absurd plotting . 2 . Poor characterizations . 3 . Lack of depth . I can't say I blame them . The first thing that jumped out at me was that the first episode was the weakest. It was a very simple premise with a large number of characters. I felt like the writer was trying too hard. It also felt like it was taking too long. The second issue is that the characters lacked depth. There was no chemistry between characters, which was a major problem.|0
"in his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by Columbia pictures.It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.This monologue is not just about ""The Killing Fields"", or ""Swimming to Cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them."|1
I found West Point to be an agreeable film , although I doubt that I would watch it again . I felt as if it was missing something , especially for a military film . The main characters were not portrayed well enough to make them seem very real , and I found it hard to believe that the film was set during the Vietnam War . There were some entertaining moments , although as I recall , there weren't too many . The only thing I will remember about the movie was the ending , which was not very dramatic , and seemed a little out of place for a Western .|0
Great party movie , following the adventures of Bill & Tom , two high school buddies at opposite ends of the country who find that their paths cross in a town they call home. They meet and fall in love. They travel back in time to meet the man that changed their lives. It is the story of two young men who find that they have the chance to change their life and find themselves in a very different place than they would have imagined. This movie is so well acted, directed and acted that I felt that it was as good as most of the westerns out there.|0
"They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make the point that women have to work to make money for a man. That's about as clear a comment on female power as they could make and still get away with murder. ""I would have never thought that the woman would do that. Never. I think she will get the death penalty. If she is convicted,"" said defense lawyer John LaMonte, who is representing the man. The video was originally posted in July."|0
"A real let down , the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for a really awful film

You would have thought that a film directed by and starring Meryl Streep and directed by David Fincher would fare a lot better, with lots of great action scenes and beautiful locations. Well, sadly, that was not the case for The Girl. The story is based around the relationship between a young Jewish girl and her father (played by Meryl Streep) who is sent to an asylum for being a homosexual, to stay until he dies of AIDS, and that’s exactly what happens."|0
Animated shorts just do n't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film . This short feature is dripping with beautiful cinematography and music that really makes this a film that is definitely worth seeing . When I was a child, I used to watch the TV show Kung Fu. The show was called Kung-Fu in Canada and it featured some fantastic scenes of Canadian martial arts . One of these scenes was the battle between Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee's nemesis the Dragon . The battle was very exciting and full of energy . I remember being very enthralled by this show .|0
`` My Blue Heaven '' is boring . The plot is insipid ; the characterizations and dialogue stink ; the music is boring . It has a bad soundtrack . I like it but not much more . I would give it a 1/2 star if they would have made it a one-time-only album . This is not a movie I would recommend . I would have just given it a 1/2 . If you like action movies or suspense movies , you have to rent this one . If you like action movies or suspense movies you will like the movie . You will not enjoy this movie .|0
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries, odds are you will find this one fascinating. Not only does it have a well-mapped out plot that while easy to follow, contains its interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured.That being said, if you know nothing of Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single-handers boat race around the world...as was the case for me...please stop reading, and rent/view this film.|1
"Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. They might as well call this show ""Generic"", because that's what it is. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals."|1
"This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen, with ""Lessons for an Assassin"" on the #2 spot.The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible! ), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one."|1
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like ""Ride Little Cowboy"" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.I had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice."|1
"I watched 40 minutes and could n't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to the kitchen to fix some lunch. I thought I had seen what I needed to see. That is when it happened. I looked at my watch and saw that it was almost 7:50 A.M. I stood and walked out of the kitchen. As I left, a voice behind me said, You know, I have to go back to work. I'll call you if I get a chance. 

I smiled. I knew this voice."|0
The only reason i did n't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on a trailer for it... I hope you're not thinking I'm too stupid to recognize the trailer as a full blown trailer for it, as this is the exact kind of thing i've been complaining about on this board for a few weeks now. I don't care if the trailer was just a full trailer for it, or just a teaser for the actual film. The trailer looks the same way it always has. Just a trailer for a teaser.|0
My son Adam ( 5 years old ) is a big Scooby Doo fan . He like this film a lot . His dad also loves this film . He really loves this film . This movie makes you fall in love . This is one of the best movie I've seen in a long time . You have to see this movie . It is really amazing . This is a great animated film that was made by a very talented director . The storyline is well written . The dialogues are well written . The animation is perfect and the animation is great .|0
This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look.|1
This is a really silly job of miscasting -- about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGONFLY. I can't imagine why anyone would want to go see this movie, though. Yeah, but I'm guessing that the reason you wanted to see it isn't because you're curious about how it made the cut and how it came out. I saw it on VOD. It's not a great movie, I suppose. But it got a lot of favorable reviews, and was well reviewed. The reviews aren't always very balanced though.|0
I, like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way  from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral  when it did occur. Nighy/Victor and Sheen/Lucian: Perfect. Now, what did not (and there is plenty).|1
I 'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n't be accused of unfair bias. That's why I always look at the credits before reviewing a film, since I'm always interested in finding out who the director is and how he or she got the idea for the movie, and whether or not the film follows the story exactly. My only complaint about this review was that the poster didn't tell us that this was the third and last installment of the franchise and there was still a chance to get all four films for free when it was released last year.|0
A very good film , focusing on a very important issue . Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect , but can be prevented , and there are many methods and products available . The film tells the story of a woman who wants to help others who have this disease . This film is available to watch online on your computer or mobile device . The film is very informative . It tells about what to do if you have Fetal Alcohol syndrome . The film also explains the effects of the syndrome and what it can be treated with .|0
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead, in its place, is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the Rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters.|1
"This movie is funny in more ways than one. It's got action. It's got humour. It's got attitude. It's got Dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! And that's just what the movie offers as a film. It's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some ""punches"" miss by feet. But when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those ""details""? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it..."|1
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie . I do n't like the baby and I do n't like the movie . I like it better as a stand alone . It is not your average horror movie, or even a horror film, in general . It does have horror in it of course, and it is not one of those slasher flicks that try to kill off all the other characters . It is, instead, a psychological horror horror movie . The premise of the movie is rather simple. It is a woman and her husband who are on a journey, trying to find their true selves .|0
"As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails."|1
"I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie ( Bella Martha/Mostly Martha ) , and everything that it stands for - I just wish that the original would be as entertaining as this one, especially as a prequel, which would be better if there was still the ""Bella/Bella Martha"" sub-theme (and not just for that reason). I know it has been suggested that this one would make a good movie if it were not such a mess, and I agree, but I also believe that it might be superior if it were more like the original ( and it is the original )."|0
"As a Genghis Khan ""fan"" I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens epic novels about Genghis and reading up on loads of historic records I feel I know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...That turned out a deception. This movie is practically made up from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring."|1
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view , and the soundtrack is lovely , we are left wondering why some of the things we've learned are so wrong. That is, of course, not to say that it is impossible to come up with a book that is both lovely and true to the spirit of the novel. Of course you can and it's a matter of finding the right combination of words and imagery to achieve that effect. For me, though, the problem is that so many of the novel's ideas seem to have been lost in translation.|0
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece . The first sequel , Jailhouse 41 , was not a box office success because of the lack of character and plot . But the sequel was a massive success on the box office because of these two films . But in this sequel , jailhouse is not prison like it was before , which means that we have the freedom to do things that we never thought we were going to do . It also opens up the question of how a female can survive and be free. This is the second in the female prison Scorpion series, Jailhouse 40 .|0
There is only one reason this movie is watchable . Till Schweiger . He is such a good actor the film is entertaining and enjoyable . He did a great job in it and I can't wait to see his next role . The only reason I watched this movie is because it looks like an old classic which I thought was not going to end up to be any good . This movie reminds me of the old movie The Wild Geese, but in this movie, it seems like everyone is having fun and the movie is about to come to a conclusion .|0
Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view.|1
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, Roundtree's small part is a far cry from his ""Shaft"" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in ""The Toolbox Murders"" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet)."|1
First things first , I am by no means a picky movie watcher . I 'm not one of those guys that go and see every movie because I know that some movies are good and some movies are not but I have seen a good deal of movies and movies have some flaws . This movie is not one of the flops of my list . It has all the qualities of good movies that I liked . The film starts off as usual . I start out with an episode of The Office of The Week and we get some footage of the team going to work.|0
"From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy ""beginning of time"" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth!"|1
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. I don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in Ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. I love the serious look that he's got going on. Its like that programme that was on on a Sunday morning that i forget the name of lol.|1
I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat.|1
Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped.|1
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema . By seeing this film , we will realize that this is the most epic movie of our era . The story is based on one of the most famous books in the history of literature, namely the novel of short story, “Nights Like This” by Vladimir Nabokov. The author, Vladimir Nabokov used to spend a lot of his free time travelling from one hotel to another . The book of story, ”Nights Like This”, is one of the finest examples of the modern novel .|0
"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg."|1
The Toxic Avenger, hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, whom is in cahoots with an evil corporation who just want the avenger gone to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less grim, much more comical tone, and a plot line that can't hold a candle to the original.|1
Honestly , how hard can it be to make a good remake ? Obviously pretty hard ! I was soooo excited to see the original movie back in the 80s and had soooo many ideas for it, I think I had it down pat. I love how it is so simple. I also really liked how it was not like the 90s . I don't remember the music from the 80s , but now I'm pretty sure that music was the same and the movie wasn't like this ! I was very surprised by how good the remake is .|0
Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the `` earlies '' ( often black and white and inventive ) are known as the classic style , the `` greats '' or `` modern '' is one of the films that came out in the last 100 years and is now considered by many as being the best and is a favorite of movie fans. The other 2 styles are the more stylized , such as The Bicycle Thief , or more stylized , such as The Wild Bunch . This year we had a few films that fit into the last type. The first of which is The Bicycle Thief .|0
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic.|1
Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue sucks too.|1
I cannot understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company,but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic(Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to grant it the same BOMB review they gave it in the 1970's).With so many scene stealers on display,Sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role.It all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15AM,but Sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon!|1
The Toxic Avenger ... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person has been elevated to a different level and it has affected his or her personality. It seems that the film would be about a person who has been changed by the treatment that they have gone through. So it's sort of like a movie about a person who has become what you call a mental patient or someone who has been treated in a mental institution or a person who is suffering from some mental illness and so forth.|0
This movie is bad . I saw the rated and the unrated versions . They are terrible ! ! Now i am stuck watching it. I just finished it but i can't help it . It is so annoying !! I was so surprised with the story. I thought it was going to be a great film ! I'm so confused . I just saw the first half of the movie. I was so confused. The story was amazing ! I was so amazed . Just saw it, and it was so amazing. The story was amazing ! What can i say .|0
Satya was excellent .... Company was just as good but more polished , probably owing to the money earned from their success. Thank you for making my life better ... I feel I have made an important step for my future. I'm now proud of the way I conduct myself. The people here are extremely friendly. I really appreciate the time and energy you've spent helping me. You guys have given me so much support in my work. I really feel like I'm in a family. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to join your company.|0
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.If you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't, BTW), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's.|1
To my eternal shame , I 've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies! I never thought I'd see one where the audience was not screaming, as they were the first ones to jump on the screen! What made this movie so good was that each scene had such intense emotions and drama that it didn't feel rushed, and the audience knew when to laugh or scream! I really didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but this is what made me feel so good and thankful to see this movie!|0
In my opinion , the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing . The initial idea of having someone else do it , the initial idea of getting someone who didn't really know how to do such a job well , the idea of having people do it for money, and even the idea that it would be funny, all those things were gone. The ending ruined it . ???? ???????? ???? ????????? ????????? ???|0
"I was laying in bed , flicking through the channels ... and boy do I have channels ... 500 of them to choose from ! I was going to order a few things from there, but what would be a good starting place? Any ideas? Edited to add: Is there a place where I could go to learn about programming with Python? I have been working for some time on a new project and I would like to understand what is involved and how to go about getting started on programming with Python. Hi

You can start out by trying a few of the available Python modules."|0
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi,Don Cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.The movie opened in 2 U.S. theatres in late April 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007.We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off.This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill.|1

He discovers that scientists are under attack, and an entire group is planning to murder his daughter and thousands of German soldiers.|0
Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I'm spending time watching the thing. I watched the emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world was the Empire Falls (excellent name)TV movie up for any awards? It truly had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend that was an OK (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? OK direction?|1
This movie could have had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course acting is needed. This film lacked both!First, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact.|1
"Very good film . Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted police do not take any justice in this case . This film gives a powerful testimony as to the true nature of India's Police. Very good and well worth the watch

It is an absolute disgrace that this film was not even screened in Tamil Nadu. All the people in Tamil Nadu and Kerala are outraged by this injustice! It is well written in Tamil with subtitles in Telugu and Hindi."|0
"I really wanted to like this movie . Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his work as Pee Wee Herman in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and James Earl Jones is pretty great too, though I have to say I don't feel he is as funny as I'd like. But what really got me was the special effects, especially the ""Pee Wee"" effects  a little too overdone. I do wish they would have come up with a new idea of what those effects could be done with."|0
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here.|1
This film is a nightmare ! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same one you feel in real life. The moment you open your eyes is the same one that occurs after you go to sleep. When you see a horror film such as this , you don't know which horror you would like to be in . You would like to feel something more than just the horror , you'd like to find some kind of meaning behind it. Maybe the person in front of you doesn't want to die , because he feels he can't be saved.|0
"A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character ""Alice"" played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library."|1
I 'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people . The series started off a lot better then . The first 2 seasons were really good . The second 2 seasons really were a downer . I have been a fan since I watched the first 2 seasons on Netflix. I really wanted to see more but it just wasn't on my radar . It was a nice change of pace . I was pleasantly surprised to see this series be rated higher . It seems to be getting some decent reviews . I don't have much information about the show .|0
"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen either the early 80's ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"" or the mid 90's ""The Stepford Husbands"", but this ""The Stepford Children"" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. It's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree."|1
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard.|1
In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi ( e.g . The Score and its opines are available at: http://score.info ) and I am curious as to who has done this before and would be interested to share their methods of planning and setting up a successful rififi like caper in this fashion. I would also like to get your thoughts and opinions on what is needed to succeed as an individual or as part of an organization in this sort of situation. I am especially interested in who has succeeded in doing something similar and if there are lessons learned that can be shared.|0
"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork."|1
"Well, after seeing ""Beginning"" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing ""Dominion"" I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better.Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. But there is so much little of it in the movie."|1
A couple of clarifying comments are in order . Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release. I have edited the video release a bit so that some of his points could be attributed to me rather than just his words. The video is an overview of the study, and is not a full analysis, but it will give a basic outline of what the study was like to do, and why it was a success. It is very important to emphasize the study is not an endorsement for a religious viewpoint, it is a research project that attempts to investigate the issue from the scientific viewpoint.|0
First , what is really great about this movie : - Ryan Reynolds , great acting ! There are very very few actor that can give you such good performance as Ryan Reynolds and he can do that in this movie . He can also portray his character in a very cool way which can make your heart melt because you are very very fond of Reynolds character . If you have not seen him before , don't worry , you won't have to , this Ryan Reynolds was so handsome in that movie and his character in the movie was very charming .|0
I'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but I'm sorry, this film is awful. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least that many clichés. It's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. And his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style.|1
Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you.|1
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the film, with the same characters and a few key differences; but the adaptation is completely different and, frankly, I’m disappointed in the lack of an original screenplay. There is an alternate version of “Odysseus” with a very different ending, and there’s no real reason to go with that one, so I’ll stick with “Odysseus.” But there’s no reason to rehash the plot of “The Odyssey,” either.|0
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape.|1
Wow... I suspected this one to be bad... But now I find myself just at a loss for words... Honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...I'll try to say something anyway...This truly is one unique gem. One of the worst kind.Lash La Rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a Toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt.It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone.|1
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, loyal retainer Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are sheltered by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek vengeance against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die.|1
My website ( www.theflickguy.org ) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time . Here is an excerpt of that article . In my opinion this is the most over the top ridiculous movie I’ve ever seen and, I repeat, the most over the top ridiculous movie I’ve seen. It is so stupid that I wonder if it would be even considered as one of the best movies of all time. The film has its moments, but it is simply impossible to comprehend the sheer stupidity that went into making such an awful movie.|0
I really do n't know why I 'm writting this . I think most people agree that this movie is terrible and people who have seen it agree on that as well . I have never seen this movie , so it would be great to hear any opinions on the same . I 've never read a book like this . I would have expected something much better , but I think there is something really wrong with what I have read . I love that this movie made such a huge impression . I have seen it several times and it is my favorite movie to have seen this year .|0
Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization.|1
I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard they are coming soon.) Commander's Log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. It's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the put-down... I just wish I could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers!|1
"For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ""Rosemarys Baby"" is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan."|1
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+ . Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely think that they are at the center of some terrible racist plot. What they're actually seeing are the stereotypes of black people used to justify slavery and the horrors of the Middle Ages. This is a cartoon that encourages and glorifies racism in young children. But, it's not just that, it's that it is being made by white cartoonists. This is an all out attempt to promote racist stereotypes about black and brown kids.|0
'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different portrayals of the characters, but in this one, they are simply hopelessly in love.) The film is pretty slow-moving in some places, but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well.|1
I watched this mini in the early eighties . Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor . In the early nineties the character became more of an enigma. There were a lot of movies made about him and he was used in a few of them . This movie was in a way different from the ones I've already shown. It was a bit shorter than the others and I liked the way the characters looked and the actors . This is a film for fans only and I don't recommend that anyone should try it .|0
Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie, “The First Deadly Sin,” and she’s just the girl we need for the sequel. “First Deadly Sin” finds Beller as a troubled high-school student whose first time getting laid ends badly. Her parents, who were in the habit of buying her pills to take them off her, finally realize that they’re about to see the truth about what happens to their daughter after she overdoses on her pills. So they decide to pay for the pills themselves.|0
I love Japanese movies -- having seen at least 100-200 . So it 's obvious I am not afraid of any Japanese movie that doesn't contain blood. That said I'm going to try and review a lot of those I love here. I will be reviewing a few Japanese movies where I feel they are superior to their English equivalents. For this I'm very biased and will be using my favorite films as I see them so that everyone can have their own opinions and enjoy them in Japanese. I think this is a great idea.|0
"This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars Robert Sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name ""Sam Marlowe"". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there."|1
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid . Since I am part of the family I can say that it was really funny, but as it is I could not take it seriously. As a fan I don't know how I would deal with them, but as an amateur, there is nothing better to watch on TV or on DVD than shows like these. I wish they would have shown more of the actual story line of the show. I was very disappointed that none of them could actually say a single sentence that I had not heard before.|0
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies. It was all downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David.|1
I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio , but here the whole movie was just a mess. The story line is fantastic , but everything was just out of reach of comprehension . It's a real shame as this is a film that deserves to be remembered . I watched this movie twice and both times I didn't like it. It's a shame because this is an absolutely fantastic film. The characters and their interactions were awesome , the acting by the entire cast was wonderful , and the production values were amazing.|0

As we are well aware , movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history , but they are often set out as a part of it. A film has a very specific, narrow view of history. If it is the story of a specific event it would be a very different experience for the audience. For this reason, films set out to relate historical events in a very particular way will often have very different films made to explain this specific event to the audiences of that film. I feel that this is an unfortunate side effect of film making.|0
I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't.|1
The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. It certainly isn't.It is about a couple who head for Egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. It is quite silly in parts. Depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.The cast is lead by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest.One viewing is enough for this movie.|1
`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'.|1
Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film.|1
Yep . Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled . The 80 's and 90's were some of my favorite decades of cartoon history . But as it turns out , The Sunbow 's not to be missed . This show was a blast . I've never been so nostalgic for a cartoon series . The Sunbow 's story line and characters made it even better . The animation and production value in this show was astounding . The fact that there were so many episodes to watch is what makes this show so much fun .|0
"The mission to see the movie ""The Cave"" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.The immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. What's he going to look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic?"|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year, until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis , maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens.|1
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional . Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the book. I read it for the movie. I was a little disappointed but I was surprised by how it turned out. I loved the story. It was a lot of mystery, and intrigue. It had a few twists but not a lot. The best twist in the film is when the killer is revealed. It's quite a shocking twist. I loved that too. I wish it would have been more twisty as the movie got to be more suspenseful.|0
It 's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film . Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the most experience of all of the actors and directors . The film is about one of the most difficult things for a person to achieve in their own life . . . You have to know what it takes to get there , to do it , to achieve it. But there is no doubt that it is a very difficult thing . I found out about this film during the time I was working on the book, but I had no idea how difficult it was until I watched it on the big screen.|0
Do not see `` Mr . Magoo . '' It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I don't know how he did it but he did , I guess he wanted to make money . I have seen many good movies like that . But I never thought it was very interesting . If I am going to see a good movie I should go see it with a good person to talk about . If you go to a movie with a bunch of people talking about themselves , then you have a very dull movie . Mr. Magoo is a movie about a person .|0
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a long while. It has since been remade and is being re-released as a 3-in-1 package along with the re-release of STAR WARS EPIC 5 as a 3-in-1 collection. We've got it on YouTube. It's been around for quite a long time and there's a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. When you're watching the original release, you may have noticed that it was actually released back in 2004 and not 2003, which I find quite odd.|0
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars. Quite a statement for a film I'd never heard of...though why I should have taken any notice of a TV announcer, I don't know. In the event, said announcer was talking tripe.It's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' awful Burr-ming-gum accent. Can't see any advantage in it being set in the Midland's anyway. Unresolved threads abound...and I wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense.|1
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. It is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.Not quite ten years after the film, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work.|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie ( you do n't have to throw cartloads of adjectives around about how boring and bad it is, but it's really not that bad and I don't think you would be surprised by the fact that you don't see this movie every week). However, despite this, I would say that the movie is still worth it and that it is worth the price of admission. I think the acting is really good, the plot and characters really well written, the acting in the film is really good.|0
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie . There 's a lot in it. I like the writing style it has a good story and action. The director is good and the action is good. You can really tell they had good ideas for what they did. I don't know if they got it right. I think the acting was weak . I would give it a 4 star rating but I don't know if there is anything to be said about it. I hope that there is more out there though.|0
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. He's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick.|1
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter as the two main stars and bringing in a bunch of newcomers to play a variety of supporting characters. The problem with the cast was they didn't fit together very well, especially when you consider how good the actors were, how they did their work and how well they performed it. They didn't have the right chemistry and the dialogue didn't flow well. The main reason I didn't like the film was that I felt it lacked any sort of emotional investment for what it was doing.|0
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of , including several on the stage , and can't understand why it is so controversial. What I would like to say is that, while I have seen every single version that I can think of, there have been at least two different sets of judges at every show I have seen. I was in the theatre that put together the first incarnation of the show (I think it was on a Saturday) and my seat had to be the last seat in the row behind the stage so I sat in the aisle.|0
I cant believe it ! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a very good concept and I really liked this film, but I am a little dissapointed when this sequel is a complete mess. Jim should have never come out like this. But I guess they just had to make a sequel to the first film in the series because there was so much badness that had to be made for this. I'm just going to sit back and enjoy what they could have done. It's been a very long time since I saw this film.|0
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings, but that isn't saying much.The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies.|1
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror , so far this season Masters of Horror have not given me much horror , it seems the producers have put a lot of their time into the horror genre and that's why they should keep doing what they do, instead of creating new genres and new things to fill the void. This episode was a good idea, it brought back a good part of Masters of Horror with the story line, and it gave a good scare for the audience that was not in the room , that way I was not disappointed.|0
I loved the first movie , the second one was okay , disappointed John Cleese was n't jean bob anymore , and the last one - well, it was OK. I don't want to see the third one. But the last one I really liked. A lot. I enjoyed it a lot even though I think it was a bad one. I saw it with some friends about a week ago and was so disappointed by what I thought was a better movie. I saw it in 3D and it looked like crap.|0
"Also titled--> The Magical Castle--> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. Only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the ""forbidden arts"" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born."|1
"A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this ""masterpiece"" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. ""The number one comedy in America"" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over."|1
River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it on video this afternoon I'm going to say that the director is a great craftsman and in the same way a painter can be very good at colouring and colouring and making the viewer concentrate on his own vision as opposed to the image and the director has done this too, he has created a piece of visual art that is quite beautiful but at the same time in its own way, a work of art.|0
**Might contain spoilers**Ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think that? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved.|1
Like a lot of the comments above me , also I though this was the average scifi movie , but it doesn't really have that. It's a bit more of a science fiction movie and a bit more like Star Trek in some way. So I thought why don't you watch this film? I don't know if it's the best or not, but it sure as heck has its moments and I would highly recommend it for anyone. It's very well made and I'd say this is a must see for sci fi fans.|0
"Firstly, this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novella, or anything else. From EW's Web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, ""...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's ''Golden Years'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception. ""The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on."|1
"Mind you , it 's not supposed to be , but it is . As a wee tot , I was given a teddy bear by my grandad , and he made it so small , but I still want to hold onto it forever , so here's one of my favourite images , I just love it : )

This is just a couple of weeks ago that I started my journey back to school after having a break for almost 3 months . After that break , we had the whole Christmas holiday period to ourselves ."|0
"""Wagons East"" is widely known as John Candy's last movie, as he died on the set. That's just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. It's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it."|1
A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy,the sensible elder brother.|1
`` Solomon and Sheba '' was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the old days. I think the audience has been kind of left behind by that but I think I think there's going to be a revival. A lot of people think they are going to be seeing a movie for a long time but, for me, this one is just so fresh and it's a great story. I think this film is going to get all of the accolades for the time it's being made, and it's very timely.|0
"If you want to truly experience the magic (?) of Don Dohler, then check out ""Alien Factor"" or maybe ""Fiend"", but not this. Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but ""Nightbeast"", which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor, is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor."|1
The acting is awkward and creepy , and not in a good way ... at all . The writing , too . This was a movie that should have been rated higher and it failed miserably .. I don't think the film deserved the R rating either , it was a film that was just so poorly put together , the acting and directing was atrocious , and the script was full of the worst writing , and I just don't even want to think about what might be happening in the next 2 hours , it just wasn't up to the level to make this an enjoyable movie at all .|0
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever . i fell bad for all the actors and actresses . ive heard it was a big bomb but i guess it was not. i would love to go back and watch the whole film again but i cant due to school. i cant even afford to go on a college tour . so . . . i guess im giving it a 3 . its a big bomb . ive never seen a movie like it . ive always hated movies and this film was so bad it made me hate movies .|0
As the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the X factor? This question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law).|1
"It seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress ""Othello"" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in ""Shallow Grave"" and (especially) ""Jude,"" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on ""Oz."" One would think them both natural Shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: Walker's Othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and Eccleston hams it up appallingly as Iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role."|1
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it? ""Return to Me"" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!)"|1
I saw this movie yesterday , and like most allrdy wrote `` i also expected a Steven movie '' , but this one isn't the worst film i ever saw. it's ok i suppose, not great, but still ok. and i mean that's just a very subjective opinion, so you can decide if i'm right or not. but this movie is ok atleast to me . i didn't see it the first time i saw it , but i've seen it a couple of times since then . i liked a lot , and i would not say i enjoyed the movie that much .|0
"I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT ? ? Why ? What ? I do not see this as much of a ""scandal"" or a problem at all, especially if you are an employee who does not know the details of it and how it would affect her work or your career. It should be an eye opener to you. I think it's great if you work at a big company, but I also understand you are probably used to it."|0
Normally I don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception.Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I watched this movie through to the end. I'm always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this, but I suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better.|1
"This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that it has the cliché ""You really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story"" routine dragged out for a while."|1
I was n't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face . Julie Walters , I don't know whether you saw my previous review on this film and I wasn't expecting to get much from it . I don't get why I got so much of a kickback from this film . I would recommend this movie to any film buffs . Even those who are into horror and I can say this I would recommend this to anyone . I would rate this a B . I thought I was going to get a C but it wasn't for nothing .|0
I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered the whole time through. I am not Asian but was still greatly offended by this film. The film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (Rex Harrison isn't even Asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention given to Biography of Anna. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner.|1
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie , you can never be sure if it will be because he is really good or because he's just Barry Corbin. The man has been cast in so many movies, that you can be sure that the person you're watching is the real Barry Corbin. And in this case, he is going to be the lead in the upcoming American comedy film called 'Snoop Dogg.' While the casting of his character, Barry Corbin, has been well-known, what is much less well-known is how Barry Corbin is going to use his abilities.|0
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. It’s about a small town in Northern California that is run by an overzealous minister who has no interest in education. The town is just too rural and poor to have much of a future, so the pastor decides to set himself up as a modern day “Great American Dream” and start a school for poor kids. It starts small, but as the school starts to grow it becomes more and more ambitious.|0
Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I 've ever seen . It 's a masterpiece where everything is at the peak of its potential. The music is brilliant . It makes you forget that all of the plot and the characters are fictional . I 've said it before and I would say it again . If there is one film that made me want to watch it again , it was this movie . In a movie that I can watch over and over again without any problems , I recommend that everyone should go and see it . If you are a fan of movies .|0
While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer.|1
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place.|1
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible. Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. Don't make the same mistake I did. The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can't pull it off. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines.|1
`` Black Dragons '' is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time . It 's not as good as the first, but still worth a watch. This was a very important movie in the early '30s propaganda movement and is an important part of the '40s propaganda movement . In this movie , there was a war going on . There was a great deal of fear for the Allies. This made them want to make sure that the Nazis would be defeated. They wanted this film made to keep the fear of war alive.|0
I really could n't get into this movie . The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so she had to be sent to some place and she finds her way to the place and she starts torturing the person in the place until she gets to her destination . You know she gets out the place and she goes back in the person's life . and the person gets back in his life and then she gets out and goes to the person again and it goes on and this goes on and the person gets out and she goes back in the person and tortures the person even more .|0
"This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. ""subversives"" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted ""criminals"" are offered three days in ""Punishment Park"". Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie."|1
I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc, These movies constitute my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but whoever I was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. I don't think words could express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney brought.|1
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. Since that time, we rate movies based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. It isn't worth a second look that's for sure.|1
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land , using the courts and threats of violence to make them leave. They don't know who he really is though, he claims to be a lawyer and they believe him. They've had a long history of feuds with a few ranchers, they're not happy and they don't know what they want. They think there's a war coming because of all that money they're earning on the ranch but they can't see how that will work out.|0
I'm sorry but I just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like they were on this show!! Personally I'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. If anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then I honestly feel sorry for them.|1
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.What it's principally lacking is charm.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors . His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses , The Apartment , The Music Man and, of course, in the unforgettable and highly acclaimed The Dark Knight are all well-known and are worthy of recognition. What most of us don't know is that there was one more great part that he did for us. I was so interested in this one because of the fact that I had never seen the movie , and I needed to see it. Not only was the film brilliant , it was also very good , but the best of all was the performance of Lemmon.|0
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made . Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of the 20th century. Mishima is a true classic. I am going to be very frank with you here and I am asking all of you to be honest with me. We all like movies and we like to see movies that we like. But there are times that you have to see movies just to know what they are about and what the message is. We do like movies that have deep themes and meaning and that you can learn something about the characters from it.|0
Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word `` STUPID '' into this post? Perhaps I could write something about the idea of STUPID -- that is, what it is, how it is defined, etc, but that wouldn't really be the point. The real point I want to get to is why I feel so strongly about the word STUPID. I see it everywhere. I feel that it is a word that I feel is being misused, that is, I do not fully understand why anyone would feel as I feel about the word.|0
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 's , others do n't quite make it into my top three. For one reason or another , here is the list of Chaplin's comedies that were released during the late '90's, that I thought did not quite make it on my list. Some may have been funny , but I wanted them all to get a little bit of attention. Some of the films may be a bit too long for my list. So please do not be so hard upon me if I didn't include a Chaplin's comedy that I think deserves a spot.|0
If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs , I 'm sure it would sound like a bad idea. The thing is , I am not worried about the marketing department. I am confident that if I pitch the movie concept , I 'm guaranteed a huge return on investment for the movie , I 'm pretty confident in my skills as a director , producer , and writer . And I 'm certain they would also love to get me to direct a movie. And they have heard of me . I can be very persuasive with them.|0
Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema, I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean movies under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize.|1
First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like cliché'e version of gangsters.The movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters.|1
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel.

Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen , it is such a piece of sh** and i do not believe that it has a plot , it really is so lame and i really dont like it . I would never watch another one , it is the worst thing i have ever seen , i will never buy another one and i have a feeling it will get cancelled i am really disappointed with it because i was expecting something better . I loved the show! But I would be very sad if it were to be cancelled.|0
"One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films, ""Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - American people trying to sound Scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others).Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle."|1
This movie was terrible . It is not something that people should have to pay to see . It looks like a documentary which has just been done to make a buck . You do not want to see such a piece of work. Saw the trailer and didn't think it was that bad. But, I've watched a lot of these type of films, and I've never seen one that sucked so bad. If I saw that trailer again, I'd think it was an hour and a half too long to waste my time on.|0
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series.|1
"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing."|1
"...now please move on because that's getting on my nerves.Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""To Die For"" (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake) started an experimental phase with ""Gerry"", which reached its peak with the thought-provoking ""Elephant"". ""Last Days"" had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while ""Paranoid Park"", his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else."|1
"I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off I am a fan of her films. She was a huge star for many years with her films like ""Anchor"" & ""I'm Not There."" After I started reading this book I realized there was something different about the plot of this movie. There was no love interest in this film at all. It was about a girl who gets involved in a man's secret life for him as an FBI agent. When I was reading about this I couldn't put it down."|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in.|1
I agree with the guy above, It is so funny I understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I give this movie a 10 out 10.I have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month.|1
"Most of Chaplin 's most famous films are his full-length features . And , I assume most people have at least seen some of Chaplin's films . However , if you haven 't seen one of his feature films , you have likely not seen at all , and you might not be a Chaplin enthusiast . This is why I have compiled a list of ten Chaplin's films , so you can see some of his greatest film . 10. The Great Diversion
Chaplin 's first full-length feature . Released in September 1896 . The film was made to promote the then newly-launched Pan-America Express ."|0
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed.|1
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do . If you have n't seen Oldboy ( or the sympathy trilogy , you are missing out ) you need to see the movie that is making waves in the box office . There is no other way to start a review on Chan-wook Park . So , without further ado , I am going to go and give it a go . And let me start with a statement that was made as the first movie was coming to theaters. For all those who watched the trailer , they should have a better understanding of what this movie was about .|0
I enjoyed the prequels , and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious . RH3 , however , wasn't all that much better . Tucker and Chan have been playing each other since Season 1 , and are a bit of a team, but they seem to be on a different page than in other episodes. This is because their relationship in the first season was such that they weren't allowed to have any conversations without Chan's permission. This means that the only thing they can have to talk about is their own relationship.|0
This movie , I would like to say , was completely great . I can see how many people would disagree with me because I can see that it is one of those movies where you really can tell if someone is enjoying it. The story follows a young boy who discovers that his family are in the possession of an evil spirit that is after their wealth and they are all going to die unless he can destroy it. But then his parents come to his rescue and you know there is going to be an ending to it but you don't care.|0
This movie was , of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen , by far the worst . If you don't have an interest in the movie , I don't blame you , because from the beginning to end it is a shoddy work of fiction . If it had been any good , it would have been more memorable and entertaining . This is the worst film that has ever existed . This is the most depressing I can remember . This is also the most pathetic that I've ever seen . Every scene is painful to watch , and I feel like a coward watching it .|0
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down a arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), things go wrong though & Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US Government. After a big shoot-out most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about, top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US & at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also being sent back to the US.|1
A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies , The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach , Lambeau , who makes it to the pinnacle of the pro football world . The film is not a sequel to the film , No Way Out , which tells the story of an out-of-luck coach and his coaching career . This movie , however , is similar in many ways . In fact , much of the film consists of re-directings and re-tunes of music used in the earlier film . At the start of this movie , Lambeau , an overweight African-American coach , has become the coach of the Chicago Bears .|0
I 'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask . I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film fan. I'm not sure what you would call me for, but I'm certainly not a 'film snob' like many people would think I am. I enjoy a wide variety of movies. I think most of the people who read these forums probably have no idea what MirrorMask was and why it is one of the most widely used filters ever created. There are a few things that I like about it. It is so easy to use, there are so many ways to customize it.|0
This was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a bud named Owen who he works with. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes hanging around with Bob. Now Owen hangs around with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accident prone. She is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. She too hangs around with Bob and Alicia, and Owen.|1
Well , that was sure a waste of Dave McKean 's talents , was n't it ? Do n't get me wrong, I 'd still like to have a go with him , but that 's all ! I 'm just not going to get into trouble over it . It 's just not possible , not in my view . I 'm only going to be around here for as long as McKean 's going to stay around . I 'm not going to change my opinion . As I say , I 'm just not interested .|0
"I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question.....Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yep....they do full meals too.Love the comment by the guy who hated the ""EVOO"" comment."|1
"For those viewers who thought the 1979 film ""Alien"" the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, ""Night of the Blood Beast,"" made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. In this film, America's first man in space crashlands back on Earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. He later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. The mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?)"|1
That's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than David Lynch's one! The special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. That's surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six part epic! Check out David Lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!|1
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley. She does not have a nice body. She has an amazing figure, but does not have any great figure to speak of. She also does not have good posture and has not been given any good make-up since she was a pre-pubescent child. She would like to be the next Cindy Crawford, but that is probably impossible since she will never be like Cindy Crawford, and the reason why Cindy Crawford could never be the next Cindy Crawford is because it’s just not going to happen.|0
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. A couple exchanging nods over their ""good grub."" A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline)."|1
New rule. Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea.Sadly, this movie doesn't. They have the premise that Bounty hunters go out and kill Zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten bounties for one Zombie? Why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a Zombie finger? Not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle.I sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and FX guys.|1
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at Eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, I see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society.|1
I caught this movie late night on TV , and was expecting a low-budget campy `` masterpiece '' , I was surprised by the high production values , I could not take my eyes off the actors , and the actors in particular . The entire film is shot in slow motion , but it works well , and keeps the story moving . One scene that stuck out the most to me was the opening credits of the film . I was wondering about how it would actually work in a movie theater , when my wife was complaining about how the film was slow .|0
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire.|1
This is marvelous movie , about a soul of Ale . This is a journey to Ale 's heart . This film is not about me, Ale , but a journey of soul , of spirit . It is very well-made film , with a wonderful soundtrack , this film is definitely worth the watch . It is a great film , well worth the watch and you should watch , it is worth watching . This film will give you a great journey , it will give you a feeling of Ale 's soul , and it will give you that feeling of soul , soul that Ale gives .|0
"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the ""rest of the world"". Story based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during WWII was the prisoner of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps. Borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter Tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. He describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation."|1
This is a pretty obscure , dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades . It is really stupid and not well written , but it’s got a nice twist at the end. And I’m proud to see a film like this making its debut. The story is about a family in the Everglades of Florida who, after moving from a very rural area, decide to venture up the Everglades by boat, with the intent of making a fresh start. As they arrive, they find an abandoned building which, despite its decrepit state, seems to be well run.|0
"I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like ""Boston Legal"" or ""Ally McBeal"" or even ""LA Law."" This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt, like the ""Chewbacca defense"" on South Park.) This is a real travesty of justice, the legal system gone horribly wrong, and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype, who use all of their skills to right it."|1
When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild , get ready . You 're in for dark , harrowing films. The kind that leave you with no choice but to see where the story ends up going. This ain't that kind of movie, of course. It may be the kind of movie that will keep your attention until the credits roll . And then you may want to see it again before it ends . . . but that's another thing. There's a very good chance you don't really want to see this movie again after the credits .|0
Big spoiler right here : this film is B ! A ! D ! But enjoy , it 's good , and that's all! The film was directed by the legendary George Lucas and stars Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. After seeing the trailer, I wanted to know more, which I learned pretty much from the credits, including some info that was not directly stated. The movie is about two brothers who are stuck in a time machine and must stop the evil Emperor and his forces from destroying the Earth. It also stars Carrie Fisher in her last movie.|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. I loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until I saw Bugged...WHAT HAPPENED?This Movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker.|1
at the story. It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in New England. Her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road.|1
This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens . I unfortunately did not make it in time for the first episode of last week’s ‘Crisis in Needlespace’, but I’ll be watching the series in a couple weeks, and will have a chance to talk to the writer and executive producer of this ‘reality television’ series about it when it comes back on our screens. If you were a member of the media during these past several weeks, did it ever occur to you that you have been used by people to try and push your own agenda?|0
"Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an ""open"" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie ""Black Emanuelle"". It is rich and colorful."|1
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example : When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the car after leaving the station, why didn't he use his new keyboard and not the keyboard from the previous episode? When Dave was looking for something in a book, why didn't he look under the table? I love how they made that part in the second part so damn hard to understand. It is literally impossible not to understand the whole scene with the keys in the air. Oh, I know. I was going for that.|0
If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.From simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. Its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends.|1
"I was unsure what to expect from ""driving lessons""- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie."|1
This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is charming as ever as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real-life author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour-guide and translator, Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a hip-hop-lovin' Ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II.|1
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. Unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan!|1
"Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and ""funny"" a show can be. Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were insufferable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this)."|1
"this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with ""cat from outer space"" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!"|1
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . Even if you are a fan who has never seen it before, the way it was delivered by the British actors and the cinematography can still give you chills , if only because there is no way of knowing how the story unfolds before we see the credits roll . The way it was told, with the British actors playing their part, makes it feel very intimate , as if the audience were being invited , rather than being allowed to go and get their tickets and watch the game with them .|0
This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long . There was an aspect of film-noir contained in the film as well as a dark humor in some scenes . The cinematography and sound effects were also great . And I really enjoyed the story of a young boy who comes back into his family from the past . The story was not overly sentimental . I thought it told the right things about the human condition . It would probably be a good movie for any age, but the young viewer may want to have some extra time to appreciate the story that was presented.|0
If good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. This movie is really good. But that's all I can say. This is a true gem of an adventure/adventurer/adventureteller. The story starts off in the late 1800's, when a bunch of men and women from all over America and Europe, are trying to leave their old lives and lives of comfort. They travel the country to see what they want, go to different cities, and do what they want.|0
"Awful in a whole new way, ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a ""vanity"" production. I am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as Isabel Gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of ""lookers"" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie."|1
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series , published in 1981 by Granada Television, which was made for the ITV network, I have posted a link to the full text of the book at the bottom of my post. It contains a number of short essays by different writers of the time, including a number by my former teacher, Michael Gove, which give a glimpse into how television was viewed then, and how that viewing experience was very much influenced by contemporary attitudes to sex and sexuality.|0
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint. I was reminded so often of other movies, it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself, is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.BUT...See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever.|1

I have n't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western . Or how one commentator could describe a piece of writing on the subject as, in a phrase, “a joke”. This is just an opinion piece, and I’m not the author. But in the first place, it is not an opinion piece, it’s a piece of journalism . The piece I have written is not my opinion, it is journalism , and I write it because I have read the article and have been informed as to the views of the author.|0

A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European's idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament.|1
the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an American of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?!|1
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. This is, without peer, the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. I had nightmares of this movie ever since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. The film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived from).|1
"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian , but I am learning right now.I also have heard that you do not really know the Russian language. So you can say that this book will be a help to us! I am waiting for you. Please send me your reviews. I will be waiting for your answers.Thank you

This book is an excellent book to help students learn the history and culture of Russia in detail. It covers a lot of material and gives students many opportunities to learn about the different regions of Russia in detail."|0
"OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal -""no really, it's research equipment, the air holes are just an accident""). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there's something to steal."|1
"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle ""adventure"". Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco!"|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories.|1
"Big spoiler right here: this film is B!A!D! But enjoy, it's good bad.Bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. Since it's a Troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. The brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, ""%@#$!"|1
"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why -- I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of ""scared straight""! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me."|1
For this movie, based off of a TV show, and a serious finale. I thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'M*A*S*H Goodbye, farewell, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like myself) skip this movie.I was a loyal fan of the show Even Stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever.|1
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ;D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.So as not to spoil anything, I wont go into detail...but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel.|1
This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs.|1
I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know , those hip , edgy movie-theater spaces -- and I have no idea what they are called, but it seems to me that it might be a great way to learn how to play the trumpet, because the movie was about a guy named Charlie Parker, and he is basically the best player of his era. And of course, the best thing about playing jazz -- and this film -- is that it actually happens in a place like this.|0
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000).|1
"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be."|1
I can only say this : ee03128 from Portugal , I could n't say it better . The worst movie ever made ! I could n't even say that it was good . It was horrible , horrid . I thought it was pretty funny ! It was horrible ! It was so awful that it took me a couple of days before i could finish the damn thing . The worst thing I have seen in years ! This movie made me sick !! I was just so glad when it was over , but i just couldn't believe the movie was done .|0
i 'm not going to ramble on about it but i 'm just going to make it brief . basically it seems to me there is one way to do it . you 'd take the time from your day , your life and just go and tell someone to make you feel good and be there for you as well as yourself . and then just leave them to take care of the rest . they could also just do it in person if that 's easier . there is no need to have a team of people doing it for you . it 's a simple decision .|0
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. Mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.SPOILER--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated.Plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee, and others. The apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style.|1
Adam Sandler 's movies are my favorite comedies . The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie . The Wolfman is a favorite thriller . But there are so many movies that can make me cry just thinking about it . But I can’t remember the last film that has touched me like the one you see in this article. Here are 15 of my favorites that you are going to read. I’ll start with something that is a favorite for everyone. A movie is a story that has to have a beginning, middle and end.|0
Last year, I fell in love with the Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library. Though I think Burton's is best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I haven't seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on them.After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job.|1
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early 'X-Files' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first ""rockin'"" episodes. It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature ""The Thing"", and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers."|1
Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times . He may have made more classics than anyone else in Hollywood . His films have influenced everyone who has loved or loathed him . But the director who has the most to lose in the face of all these claims? Stanley Kubrick . He could lose his legacy as the greatest director to have ever lived, but he would be a good loser. His masterpiece, 2001 , might be the best film of all time . But Kubrick would also lose his standing as the greatest filmmaker of all time.|0
Barbershop 2 : Back in Business was n't as good as it 's original but was just as funny . I am a big fan of this series and I would highly recommend this book for anyone into the industry . It is a humorous book . I would rate it 4.5 stars out of 5 I really liked how this series kept going back in time and telling the origin of all the different characters . It is an amazing book . The best part of this book was that they were able to show the characters growing up . This was a really unique way to show how a character grows .|0
Steven Segal 's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema . I have been tragically bored with every one of his pictures. His first film, “Man on Wire” , was just so bad. I never saw it again and his next, “I Can’t Stop the Rain” , I saw twice in two days. But he has not lost his ability to put on his favorite show, that is why I was very disappointed with his last movie, “I Hate Movies.” In spite of being one of the best directors in the history of film, he fails miserably with his movie.|0
As a word of explanation , Disney 's `` The Kid '' has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Brown and Snoopy cartoons or the cartoon shorts of Mickey Mouse and the gang , except that they both were created by Disney 's animator Walt Disney . I believe that Disney and Disney 's team of animators came up with this idea in their own way . It has been said that Mickey Mouse is simply a reflection of Walt Disney 's ideas for how to depict his characters . Therefore , this is probably one of the first cartoons where Walt Disney 's character is used in another character' cartoon .|0
Wealthy businessman 's daughter , who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath, said she can’t breathe at the age of 15 because she has never had the chance to work. She has three children but they are still young and do not help much in paying the bills, which is why she and her husband are left with a modest income. She said, “My biggest concern is that we will not be able to provide for them as we did during my childhood.|0
I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was OK, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside US. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. The screenplay is horrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles.|1
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise ; the sequels still surprise me greatly. There was the film I saw on VHS that I can't remember any of the characters in (which I thought was hilarious). But I did recognize most of the people. I have to admit, however, I don't remember all of the people, and there are a lot of people that I don't recognize, and I have to say there are a LOT of non-human characters in the films, but at least all the humans are very recognizable.|0
I thought the movie was sub-par . The acting was good but not great , the story was funny but the screenplay was nothing , the screenplay didn't help much either . It seemed the movie was made in such a short period . They should have made it longer . The acting was ok ,but I didn't like it . Overall , I thought the movie wasn't that good . I didn't like it . I was expecting more from a Jodie Foster type movie , but she was average in her roles . The story was a bit dull and it was too predictable for my liking .|0
There are movies that are leaders , and movies that are followers . `` Meatballs '' was a leader . It had a great storyline . It was an epic . It was great . It was the first movie of its time . I mean , that's a really big statement that you make about a film . But then the movie also was a very good movie . That's a big statement as well . There's so many films that are good but they're not as good as '' Meatballs . You don't see that often with some of these movies .|0
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things."|1
A small-town schoolteacher ( Geena Davis ) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be the most popular girl at her town's school. However, after she begins to remember a life before her time, she realizes that the memory is also an illusion, and decides to take it as her own. In the end, she goes on to become the most beautiful girl on earth. This film is the debut film of actor/singer/songwriter Nipsey Hussle. The movie is also the debut of the film crew and the lead actress.|0
Actually , Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times ... mostly due to the cartoonish jokes and characters he had, but still, I love this show ! The animation is super cool, the sound effects really well done, the voices are super nice ... I think this show will be good. I also think this show will be very fun to watch, with a very mature and funny storyline, and great voice performances. It's just too bad though, because it doesn't deserve to get canceled at the first sign of trouble.|0

Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick.|1
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you.|1
Eaten Alive follows a young woman ( Janet Agren ) who searches for her lost sister . Turns out her sister is a missing person, and we all know what happens when you let a missing person go. But that's just the beginning of her troubles. She ends up with a job that's more interesting than her sister ever could've expected, and her life is turned upside down by a guy she's not supposed to love and doesn't really know what she's doing here on earth. The first thing you'll notice when you look at this film is how little you see.|0
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie , Eddie Monroe . I thought I would watch it again to see if I had watched the wrong Eddie Monroe movie. The movie is about Eddie Monroe and his exploits in the 1970's. So, I did it and found out I was right. I saw the movie twice to be sure. The second time I was at my friend's house and I had already watched the DVD on his computer. So, I knew I could watch the movie again at my home.|0

I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad .. From the script (which was pretty much all written by the film people) the film is like a zombie movie with the lead character being a zombie. Not very interesting to watch but good enough to scare anyone who's not prepared for what's coming. But the worst part for me was that there was nothing I could do about the awful acting. I'm just going to assume that I'm in the minority that really dislike this film as much as some of the rest of the audience.|0
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.Basic plot -- Nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before.|1
"Being a wrestling fan , movies about wrestling generally suck ( Backyard Dogs , Bodyslam , Jesse Ventura story ) But if you’re not into wrestling it can be a bit hard to get the details of wrestling from a non wrestling fanatic . Below is my attempt to get all the details about wrestling from an “ average” person . I will post some spoilers if I have any . Enjoy ! Wrestling history:

WWE began in 1997 and since that time the World Wrestling Federation ( WWWF ) has become the top-ranked professional wrestling organization in the world which is followed by the World Wrestling Association ( WWA )."|0
Low budget mystery. A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan(Chick Chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. The woman in a hurry, Mary(June Clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the real thing. This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape.|1
Cheap , gloriously bad cheese from the 80 's , the decade of cheese . I watched this one first on YouTube , and when it aired I went into my local pizza shop and ordered some. And then proceeded to buy the rest of the pack . It came in two portions, and the first one was great , but the second was bad . So bad . I was in tears when I first opened it up and I couldn't believe I had just given it to someone else . I tried to think what had I done wrong and I could not remember what the original recipe was .|0
Yes , I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill ! Julie, thank you for making me one of your fans. I enjoyed the show and am glad to hear that you did as well. I saw the show the night of it at a local theatre. I thought the cast and director did a great job. I have since had a couple of drinks at a bar downtown. The show was good , I saw it again the following day. It is not the best show on Broadway . But, I will continue to see it .|0
"i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the ""realism"" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the ""little"" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it."|1
A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part.|1
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par.|1
So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with.|1
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization.Read Proust, you morons!! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies.Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, HOURS...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW!!|1
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert, add a bit of an atmosphere and you'll get this.If you were to turn the desert upside-down to the north-east, you'd get this.If you turned the north-east half to the west, you'd find this. As I said in the first post, it's not my favourite but it's not horrible. I think you could get it at an auction though. I would guess there is a good bit left over.|0
I was very disappointed in this film. The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way.|1
"This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco . It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners , and what life can be like if you can go there. Babenco's story is not only realistic, but also extremely touching. After a few years, Babenco made the decision to move to Sao Paulo and start acting in films. The decision was based on a desire to have ""an adventure"". It is in the movie that we meet him as an adventurer, who decides to go to Rio de Janeiro for a week."|0
I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey ( like Zach , I 'm from New Jersey and love the movie ) but the way I saw it. This movie is the best of all of them . I don't know why . I love it. I love it . I don't want to spoil it . But if I were the director I wouldn't . It's not like I was going to add or change or anything , just as a matter of taste. If I were in the audience I wouldn't have been offended at the way the audience reacted .|0
Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS `` event '' . There are no stars, no music, and no special effects. And if it were a documentary, there would be one shot of Peter Jackson and a few of his film makers talking about how they came to do this movie and why they did. But, there is no film, only a documentary. It is called `` Peter Jackson: The Making Of `` . Peter Jackson is a very good filmmaker, and he is not just a guy making movies for the big screen.|0
Here's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man.Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep.|1
This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time.|1
"Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a couple of things. First, this film is nothing like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like it.I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the basic approach of the film maker is not ""surrealist"" per se. therefore its not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a weird Euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of ""wierd"" not surreal.Secondly, I think the music by Heuzenroeder is brilliant."|1
Do n't get me wrong . I 've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band , so I think I can do with it. However, I'm not sure about the music, and I'd like a little background before I jump in. I don't write music, although I've been doing a little piano work and teaching since I was at uni. I've had a lot of people tell me I could do what I need to do as a guitarist/performer. I'd really appreciate some information on what I should look for, as well as any other suggestions I might have missed.|0
"Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white, while they conveniently forget that both ""Clerks"" and ""Schindler's List"" were filmed in black & white and are great movies.Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black & white are the same people who wouldn't like ""Psycho"" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes."|1
"Before you watch this movie - clean your ears , take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your spouse that when you see them in this movie you will not be able to take a single glance at them while your eyes are on their face. In the film ""Dangerous Liaisons"", the female lead is played by Ria Cheranian and it was very interesting to watch her on screen and hear her voice and watch her walk and talk. Ria Cheranian has a beautiful voice and I loved listening to what she could do and hear."|0
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to give the audience a hint of where the story is leading us. Sometimes, that’s just good enough, as in “The Fog,” where the story is told with no real clue as to the end result. At other times, it’s not so easy. It’s all too easy to get carried away by the visuals and not really get to know the characters and what they are going through.|0
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare . This game is actually a great game and I loved playing it for what it was trying to do but I just do not like the fact that I had to play the main campaign for 20 hours just to win it . I guess I am not used to this type of game or maybe this type of game does not excite me . If you are looking for a game that can make you go from bad to better than ever then check this game .|0
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences.|1
How awful is it ? Let me count the ways : 1 ) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts with a pretty girl falling in love and then ends with her falling for a rich guy instead of a poor girl. How can we like a movie that has all this going on? 2 ) The girl is in love with the rich guy, but her brother is a thief and a criminal. Can we really be friends with someone like that? 3 ) She is so naive that she just gives her boyfriend a chance, but then he decides to break up with her for some reason.|0
This movie, which I just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel, rather than on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of Coney Island.|1
I can't really criticize this film. It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. The acting is on a high level.|1
Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot . There she is met with a man she is attracted to, but is told her father will never approve of them dating . So, she goes on a search to learn more about the African people who live with the man that she fell in love with. At the same time she tries to make her father approve of her new love, but when he refuses to listen to her father's orders, she decides that she must do something to get her father's permission.|0
I rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.It starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. Its called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? Well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.Then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst.|1
I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through.|1
"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere)."|1
"Not a box office success; no-one really knows why. It may have failed simply because of its title. It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Hard Weapon"", ""Die Lethal"", etc. - talking about ""the long kiss goodnight"" will get you nowhere. But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie. A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on."|1
A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. It could be set in any town in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well.Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.The actors are scarily believable, I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes.I loved the way this film was shot.Overall this film IS a must see.|1
There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this . It was painful to watch , but strangely I managed to save the tape. I can't quite understand why there isn't at least a 1/10 option, as it should have been my choice. I'm so frustrated because the crew was absolutely amazing to me. I have to admit , I felt as though they did a lot more work for me. I'm really looking forward to seeing it on Blu-Ray in the future. The sound was a little weak in places but I did have to put up with that for the 2 hour show.|0
"Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! I was appalled. Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his ""thumbs up"" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.What a pity. Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program."|1
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer.|1
when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE, Which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, Andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. And lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me Well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. And to make things worse i have the whole set on DVD fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche.|1
"I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ""Ethan Mao"" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I am going to give away a key element to the ""plot"". After holding his family hostage overnight, Ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - ALONE!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the cops! Wow ... what a twist!"|1
Brilliant Aussie movie... A little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line, as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening...|1

This game is very good for the price. I don't know if the developers did the right thing or if this was a way for them to make money."|0
'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it 's why I have no identity. But I can feel them around me. They can see me if I open my mouth. I don 't think about them because they don 't matter because they aren 't me. It's me. When I open my mouth. I am me, but I am not my. But that's the feeling I have. I don 't like that. I 'm like my mother and I'm her because she has no identity.|0
"There is a point in the film where the female boss of the ""death machines"" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive I think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. Except such is her delivery that it sounds like ""leatherage."" At which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The boss lady had to do the talking as the ""death machines"" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does."|1
"This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . Unhappy 'easterners ' are not pleased with how they are treated by the government , so they decide to put on a circus of a show to get rid of the "" eunuchs "". I love it when movies tell the story through the words. That's what I like about this one, the story unfolds from the beginning, so it's always new, always fresh. Even though some of the characters are annoying and annoying, but there are also funny ones in the bunch."|0
In the 1940s , Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and her ability to seduce everyone who came within arm’s reach. Born to wealthy British aristocratic family in the British capital of London , Lake had the opportunity to go to school in Switzerland and later, Paris in addition to making her acting career in Britain. In 1952, Lake met and fell in love with screenwriter and director Frank Capra , and for years, she followed him in his films and his dreams, making him into a star and a legend of the silver screen.|0
"I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after ""Eraser."" ""End of Days,"" however, can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in. ""End of Days"" starts well with a gripping action sequence, yet quickly becomes a bore, taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read ""Doomsday""). Performances are stale, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful."|1
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in. The acting and the story was just terrible. I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses.|1
"This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care.This movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. It's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of ""men""."|1
I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake . The DVD version titled `` The One-Armed Man `` is not available in this country. The show is still broadcast and available elsewhere, though, so I'm giving the DVD version of this one the nod. It's worth the $8 to see the original cast members, some of whom have died since this episode aired in the mid-'70s; the show's creators; and to find out why this episode has never been seen outside of America. (I should point out that this show was filmed in Vancouver, which is in Canada.|0
"Incredibly , `` Vampire Assassin '' is significantly worse than such atrocities as `` Tequila Body Shots '' and `` Tequila Cocktails

There is nothing particularly shocking or shocking in this article. But there is something in it, that makes it worthwhile. You will learn enough about this topic and the various aspects of it, I hope, to provide you with the kind of knowledge, that is necessary, to understand the subject more effectively. This, in my humble opinion is more important than any article written about this topic that has appeared in the mainstream media or anywhere online."|0
I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons.Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.This movie.|1
"The story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered ""valley girl"" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. What a great and worthy story line. But in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose?"|1
Everyone knows that late night movies aren't Oscar contenders. Fine. I mean I'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and figured I'd get to some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the info on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave it half a star. To be fair, I did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious.|1
Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've ever seen ! `` The Beginning '' was not the greatest either, and I thought that this might be one of the best movies ever made. It is a remake from the original, but the story is entirely different. It takes place before '' The Beginning '' was made. It was a remake, and it was not made by the original director. I have no idea what was going on in this film, but it looked horrible and I found that it had no point. I mean, it is a remake.|0
Under no circumstances watch this film . It is terrible for a number of reasons : No plot No structure, no suspense, and the ending leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I don’t understand why anyone would watch a film like this. I just watched this film and was shocked at how poor it is. Not only is this film terrible but it is so terrible and poorly shot. The only thing that kept me from turning it off and never watching it was the ending, but I don’t need it in my life so it was a pleasant change of scenery.|0
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. I found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. I'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. With everyone else getting killed, all through the movie I wondered why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brains out.|1
This is a tough film to review , since several factors need to be taken into account . Let 's go through what we can from my perspective . . . . This is a film that needs to be watched by the entire family to fully comprehend the message it has to deliver . This film deals with the issue of racism and how it affects the lives of the black and brown people of this country . It does not try to show how these issues affect the lives of white people , which is an oversimplification of the true story .|0
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. The characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems.|1
We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. The west Texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him.|1
Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption . for the sake of argument let's also consider it 's title character and how he is treated by his doctors . it is clear early on that the writer is trying to portray Sellers as someone who is in a difficult situation in which the only way he can save his life is to take care of other people . in fact , he is actually the only person the doctor has ever cared for in the whole life of their relationship , because he is the only person the doctor can call his friend .|0
Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. They aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No.Acting, corny and rubbish.Sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.Cinematography. These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix.|1
"I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression."|1
"Stephen Sondheim 's SWEENEY TODD : THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with an emotional, multi-layered musical with songs from every major rock and roll period. The show became the longest-running show on Broadway for 25 years. The first previews for the show began on 7 January 1979 and the first night of previews for the show was on 16 January 1979, but the opening night was moved to 21 January 1979, due to poor weather conditions on the opening night of the play.

"`` Jefferson in Paris '' is a truly confounding film . It presents Thomas Jefferson ( Nick Nolte ) in the midst of the Revolutionary period of his life and how his actions led to his downfall as a revolutionary and an institution of his society. The film uses several different stories to tell of Jefferson's time and his character. The film is based on the books "" Jefferson's Writings "" and "" The Republic of Letters "" by Thomas Paine. The film follows Thomas Jefferson through several events in his life. The first is the time he writes "" a letter to General Washington . """|0
Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
"""Go Fish"" garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. The entire film rings hollow. I cringed the whole way through.Its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. Well not much more here to be learned than from ""In and Out"". By now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes."|1
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him.|1
I never comment on a film , but I have to say that this was one of the worst films I have seen in a while . It is just a mess that has been on the shelf since I saw it last year . I have never seen a bad film in my life . I am hoping that some of these comments will help to get me out of the mood I have been in for a little over a month now . When I was at school, I would regularly go out of my house and walk down the road to a local cinema or a theatre.|0
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s . Guy Stone is a producer who finds himself a producer on this film. When I first started my career I made a lot of films. I didn’t realize it was part of what made me great. I made films because they were fun and enjoyable and I saw myself as a creative. I saw myself as a director first and a writer second. I was never a producer or a screenwriter first and I never wanted to be.|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13.Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue.|1
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the CPUSA was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). The troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the KGB did, and presumably, what the good patriotic Americans were fighting. Yet the FBI did them and didn't bat an eye.|1
This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clichés, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions! !, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!!|1
"Mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn't really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like ""Gymkata"" and ""The Pumaman,"" ""No Holds Barred"" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling."|1
Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson , this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By far the worst parts of the film are the two-part scenes where we have to watch two different movies on one day. As such, it is impossible for the audience to feel anything in between. Somewhere down the line, a lot of viewers who have seen this film are going to think that it did something special, and that it should have been nominated, but what it did really was a piece of shit. It doesn't do much to make you sit down, either.|0
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a girl by her father a few years ago. Now, because of rape in general, this is not a terrible thing, but I don’t condone it. The main reason I don’t condone it is that this was a girl that I love and I wanted to protect her from this horrible person, and the movie made her feel bad. The movie is based on events that occurred in the 1980s, and since that time the girl has done great.|0
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion."|1
"Let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : ""Let's see who is meanest"" said with a straight face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny.How do you think Arnold will battle the evil of all evils?Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even Satan expected it they're so clever.After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate) it goes nowhere. Somebody get me those two hours of my life back."|1
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.|1
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? The whole ""Complete Jane Austin"" series as a part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. Characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels rather rushed. The 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy though that ""Pride and Prejudice"" won't be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists."|1
So many of us who are devoted to the `` art '' of the motion picture will disregard or forget the first rule when we go out on our screens. ``The picture is not the thing'' is a popular saying. It is an old maxim that can be traced from the beginning of cinema by the early pioneers, and from the beginning of film history by the first filmmaker. Today we are in the age of digital cameras, computers and so many new technologies that are making the old art of motion picture production obsolete and obsolete for us all.|0
Monday, October 02, 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese take-out, turned off the lights and pushed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was most certainly a let down. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present, a cannot be omitted sex scene, and the all too familiar pre-spook (when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy).|1
It 's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into a theater. We're used to seeing that in theaters or on cable TV. You have to think that if you refuse to distribute a film for a month, you lose your right to use it and you lose your right to have a say in its marketing and you lose the rights to any future work that the film might get made by someone else. So there it is, and you can see it from the perspective of what's going on here.|0
`` While sporadically engrossing ( including a few effectively tender moments ) and humorous , the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming ' was a big hit in the early 2000s. And, as with 'Scorchers', there was nothing that wasn’t going to be said about it. I can’t remember a single word. I do remember it being funny, but it did come across as a bit self-indulgent . However, I don’t remember the plot. What I do remember was how well the cast was playing off each other. I remember that the characters were well developed and the writers really had a lot to say.|0
"There is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure it was the teacher. In fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. I guess the point of that is that ""rape is omnipresent. You never know who it is going to be"".)"|1
I have always liked the Carry On films , with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy . But as I watched The Adventures of Robin Hood they just didn't work . I would have to say they are the best films ever made , but they did not live up to the hype . I still have a copy somewhere , but I just can't seem to get to it . I really want to get it but I have so many other stuff to do , it doesn't seem worth the effort .|0
"I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ""The Dain Curse"". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film ""The Molly Maguires""). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south."|1
"What can I say? After having read Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they appeared to ""big stalagtites"" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate."|1
What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders.|1
This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through . After the introduction of an evil alien from outer space, it has taken about a week for the whole movie to even begin. I’m so sorry it took that long! If it wasn’t already a terrible movie, I think this was one of the worst things I have ever seen. The story had no reason to come to be (and it still has no reason), yet the special effects were laughable (and they are in my opinion).|0
An absolute classic of 80 's scare flix . This one is n't like any other as it pits pint-size super villain The Joker against a team of mischievous teenagers as they fight to keep the world at peace . You don't see this sort of thing very often. So what's so great about this movie? Let's start with what it doesn't contain. It is a horror movie and should be a good one, but not great. Sure, it has its scares, but they don't feel very real in this case and they aren't very good either.|0
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them.|1
"I have for years remembered a song ""JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE"" (""No. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air""). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. I located a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 year old at the Ligonier PA theatre. I was pleased to find that it had Kenny Gardner the singer with Guy Lombaro (I am a Lombardo fan)."|1
It may be, although there are still two or three I've missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not.|1
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! What possessed the filmmakers to do this? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! Do not see this film. And have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue.|1
WOW!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be real stupid. No, this film is far more in common with The Thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) Lots of Carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood.|1
"What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not that much. With the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. None of which were funny. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the ""zany"" one-liners."|1
I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. etc. Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie?|1
"This telecast of the classic musical ""Sweeney Todd"" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.Firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. Then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.The main failing here is in the performances people give. Oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, ""Kiss Me."""|1
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one . i do n't mind telling you it's the best one ever made . i can go on and on but i'll save that for later . the story is very much like that you mentioned before , but with the addition of one major plot line - the love of a lifetime , which will drive you through the remainder of the film like never before. the way this movie was made with all of the details, action sequences and explosions that are just so epic .|0
"I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show ""The Big Valley"". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.And so it was for ""Christmas in Connecticut"" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas."|1
"This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times , and I had read two books on my own about what has been going on.

"First of all, even IMDb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is VERY ""gappy"". Even main characters are missing from it like Buddy for example.Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much, is because I was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.The plot line itself is good. It could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting."|1
Everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if I'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. Good: The overall plot was mildly interesting. The music was overall pretty good.|1
I'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white, foreign tourist. They picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager.|1
OK, I read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position.Micheal, I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it.|1
I don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot.|1
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport. She's in a heap of trouble, I won't say what exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her out.I mention that because one of the grievances that the Chinese including the bandits who attack the American mission in this story set deep in the Chinese interior was that particular institution whereby American citizens who committed crimes were tried by American courts set up by our consulates. We were far from the only country doing that however.Anyway the story opens with her on a train for Shanghai trying to use a hokey Russian accent.|1
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA , who end up having some problems with their daughter. They are in their 30's, they are living together. When they finally decide to leave the city, the last thing they wanted to do was turn around and face life in Los Angeles alone. So, they set out to make the best of it. They don’t do well, and they become the target of some shady people who have their own agenda. So they decide to leave LA and get away from everything.|0
There was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. One common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.Down Periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. Not an original or terribly well written screenplay. A few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case.|1
This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make things worse, later Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood!!!??? And what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as alcoholic!?|1
"Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it this past weekend, and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better...it didn't...The picture quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting itself was cheesy, but I guess it's acceptable for ""yet another"" teenage horror flick."|1
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals . When they learn the animals are being used to test a dangerous pesticide, they must decide whether the animal should be saved or exterminated . Based on the award winning screenplay written by the Oscar® winner and award winning actress Susan Sarandon , The Island has all the ingredients to be a blockbuster Hollywood movie . The Island has all the elements of a blockbuster movie, including a talented cast, a well crafted story, suspenseful characters, and a compelling plot .|0
This movie is dated in so many ways , it 's sensational . You can either laugh at it or weep over it . But if you want to make out with this film then we are here to convince you that there is nothing that you have seen in this movie which you wouldn't enjoy in any other movie of this genre or genre in general . You can see it for a while and then realize that you haven’t seen anything of such caliber for some time. But then again, there is nothing that this movie cannot do, so you might as well take your time , enjoy it .|0
Nurse Charlotte Beale ( the lovely Rosie Holotik ) has arrived to Dr. Stephens ' clinic for the insane prepared to help. It is a great start for the doctor and his staff but is she ready for this job? She has never been a nurse before but is not quite sure what this new job will be. What do you think of Charlotte as a person and nurse? This is a short review and is based on my own impressions of her, I hope you all enjoyed it. Don't forget to leave your comments and rating below so we know what you think of her.|0
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in a Sneak Preview, and left after half an Hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I., still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended.|1
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!!|1
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull . I found myself disliking the storyline and not enjoying it as much as I would like because of the story. I also had the feeling that there were two versions of this film, with two different endings . I didn’t find out what happened until I watched it on YouTube . The ending I got was different than what was in the original movie, which was fine . There’s no way to say that the ending in the movie wasn’t good, because the ending was pretty good.|0

""It’s not that hard to keep your nose clean!"" A couple of days ago, I wrote the following words in an effort to be more ""up front"" when talking about all the great things I am learning.

Fox is pretty lame . They cancel the wrong shows . It 's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written and well-acted comedy that just happens to be a black guy. I am tired of Fox . . . . I hate Fox . . . I am sick of the network that has so many problems. I hope Fox goes bankrupt. I hope the Fox News network gets taken over by the right-wing religious extremists. Fox News sucks. If you are a true liberal then you should be ashamed. They do not have anything to offer other than liberal propaganda.|0
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the moment I arrived at the film’s set in Malayalam, it became obvious that I would be immersed in a unique experience. My eyes were transfixed by a scene where a young girl was forced into sex for the first time ever by a serial predator.I had seen the scene countless times since then. In fact, there were no other scenes of sexual assault like the one I had witnessed in that room, where the young girl was seduced for a mere five minutes before being rescued from her perverted lover.|0
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad . This movie has terrible characters, weak storyline, boring storyline, awful acting , and it is a waste of time watching it. The only good thing is the music but that is not what makes the film.The movie starts off with a young, attractive girl (Zoe Saldana) and her family moving into an old, deserted mansion in the city. At the end she is given a chance to move into her uncle's mansion where she meets her Uncle and his family.|0
I have only seen this movie once , when I was about 14 years old , but I was thrilled by it . It gave me hope that I might get through my teen years with not much going on . And I did . I also got to live with the main characters for a short time , which I thought was cool. It wasn't my favorite part , however , but I'm glad I saw it and that it sparked my interest in film-making . It wasn't something that I would necessarily go out to see again .|0
This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist.|1
(This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever.|1
"I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad ""effects"" which got me annoyed through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. This film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end."|1
Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion.|1
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie . It appeared it might be serious drama , dealing with issues and issues that could be dealt with in an academic setting. However, it was obvious to me that the movie has some serious problems and could be a disaster. The characters in the movie didn’t seem to know what the hell they were doing. Some of the characters even had no idea what they were doing when they had to do certain actions. For example, there was a character on a boat that was doing the wrong thing.|0
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening, thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. On this promise, at least, the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual, adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. As does the movie. A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty, rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning.|1
This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.The movie's timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors.|1
I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing.|1
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle.|1

I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, I must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact.|1
I was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do I have channels... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... DVD has spolied me.Anyway, I'm flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it.|1
What a wonderful film , filled with eccentric , unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The movie is about an elderly man and his two friends who go on vacation. The first time they do it they are surprised when they find a man who looks like their father, who they don't know anymore. At first the trip goes as planned , the two old men are going on holiday and are excited. The next morning the old man goes out to his garden and sees his father walking toward him.|0
"Comedy? What's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time I turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? Set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. Served up with lashings of Hollywood's religious ""God will Save you"" redemption drivel Another Reviewer mentioned the ""Sassy dialogue"" of Tea Leone - well I managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and I still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than Tea's character in this rubbish."|1
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round Lake Tommahawk I for one would not mind living there!All in all a great film to watch over and over again.|1
`` Mararía '' really disappointed me . I ca n't consider it as a bad movie , but the development is just not very satisfying . It has all kinds of plot flaws , and I don't like the direction that is taken . I don't think the script is well done . I can't give it any more than four stars , considering that this is one of those films which you want to stay on the screen for an hour , but if you want to have it for a while , then give it a few more stars .|0
"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that ? Apparently shot over an X-ray ! And why couldn't it show any X-rays ! What were they looking for ? They had to know ! And they had the X-rays to show it was shot over their X-ray ! Then he asked, ""Now what did they find then ? "" ""There was only one man who could tell the X-rays apart from the others, he was a doctor who had been in the service a long time ."|0
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film ? ? Its not because of money spent on it ? I actually think this is the best film that was released in 2009. Its the one I watch most often when I come across something to watch. To me this was the most important film ever produced. It had a huge budget and took a while to make as the cast was young and needed to get acclimatised to working together and the camera was new. This film is still considered a classic today, so I was really excited when I got the opportunity to see it back in 2009.|0
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best one), I was looking forward to see this film. I didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv I'm terribly happy I resisted buying it on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in Dutch film history. All the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. All humour has been cut out.|1
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Still I attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways.|1
If you thought NBC 's 10.5 was stupid , you 'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the trash can when it came to reality programming and actually picked up ' House of Lies' for a three-hour season finale tonight. After the show hit a roadblock in its pursuit of a deal with Disney, FX 's legal team and FX executive producer and showrunner T.R. Smith took to Facebook to blast NBC for the cancellation. The show's end came hours before the network was set to go on the air with its latest season of ' The Americans ' on the schedule.|0
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie ! ? ! ? Although I have n't seen it myself I am sure that the director has a plan for this one ! Â I just love his style of directing. He reminds me of the great directors of the '90s Â with a very modern and unique style. __________________

"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a ""thriller"" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish ""starting"". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of ""No Country for Old Men"" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters."|1
It is difficult to compete against classic greatness , but once you make that choice and the decision is in your hands, the path to glory is easy. I have been working for a long time, but the only way to get a job is if I have to do it and if you are not working, you get fired. I am not looking to get fired. I am just trying to build my resume and get a position that is going to help me get hired at a good company and get a job that I have no problem doing.|0
1 ) Bad acting.2 ) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet , it sure looked like home. 3 ) It’s supposed to be a great movie . It was a really great movie.4 ) It’s a well done movie . There are a few flaws, but overall it was well done. 4 ) It has a great story . I really enjoyed this movie as well. I loved the idea of the kids who went to the planet searching for something they were told would be important and they found something they never thought they would.|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. She should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave.|1
The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by.|1
We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. I've seen that Junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID! !|1
I really liked the Far Cry game , nice graphics , good level-design , interesting and clever enemies , above-average voice acting. I also enjoyed the story, some parts of the game will stick out to you, but all of the story will make it worthwhile, and it's quite fun to learn the side plot, as it is not too repetitive. There were a few times when the characters could be a little overdramatic, but nothing that would distract me from what was happening, and that's what makes this story so interesting.|0
This movie was beyond awful , it was a pimple on the a * s of the movie industry . The only reason why this movie even made it to theaters was because of how badly the studio wanted to kill it. The film’s marketing was just horrendous . This is a “must see” movie but I have to say , it’s not that great of a film . The film is not good for anyone and I am sure there is a lot of stuff in it that would make it better . But all the trailers are just so bad .|0
The first time I saw this film I was a kid . I was ten years old when it was released, in a sense. It wasn’t until the 1980s that I had seen a wide range of films in a single sitting. There were many great films at the time but what was most impressive to me was that they all arrived in a single night! I was so impressed with this film, I decided at the age of eleven that I was going to see it again and again. This time, I would also see it on DVD.|0
Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it, as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. There was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it.|1
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO. It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater, providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers.|1
In the European TV industry , movies like this one are called `` stickers '' . TV stations buy them and put them in front of their audiences in a very special way . This story is really quite strange ! It's true that many TV shows and movies are made for the fans and they don't give any money for this : it's all done by people like you or me . But, they know that this is a really unique way to reach audiences. They also know that with the new digital TV , there are thousands of movies available for this very reason .|0
"Oh f * cking hell , where should I start ... First of all ; this show is just another show that they do on the cheap. It seems that they really are not in the business for anything other than to make more money. But I will say that I am glad to hear that they are starting to learn their ""business"" like they did the first season. And the second season is only going to get better and better with the new cast members. I don't have anything against the actors themselves, I just feel that they don't do very much and are trying to please everyone."|0
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one.For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.2. You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie. (believe me, it's my domain)3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.4.|1
Chop Shop . Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart ) . Bahrani specializes in character driven movies with a large ensemble cast that features a number of Oscar nominees , Academy Award nominees , Tony nominee , Golden Globe nominee . Based on the book of the same name by the author himself . Chop Shop is Bahrani's first film, but he is a writer first and foremost . This is the first film I've watched in many years where there were no credits , and most of the time you wouldn't know there is an actor who is playing a part .|0
My yardstick for measuring a movie 's watch-ability is if I get squirmy . If I start shifting positions and wiggling my hips or if I feel as if something's going to shift, I may not want to sit for the movie. I'll tell you this, I don't really like horror movies, even though I understand why people do like horror films. I'm just not into them. If I see one that I like I'm going to sit down and watch it, I'll be ok, but I won't be into it.|0
"This film was utterly horrible. Stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. Whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. Reminds me of a hack student film, BUT WORSE. Who ever produced this should give up now. I know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this ""fantastic"" as some think ""Dune (1984)"" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. OK, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers."|1
"Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film ""experts."" it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he has done."|1
"With great expectations I went to see this film , Spain 's contribution to the Oscar-race this year . Part of the movie is in the Spanish version. I am not going to spoil anything in this post ( I will do the spoiler-post). It's a long story and I hope you'll go to this page to read everything you missed the first time . I'll start from the beginning. I am going to talk about "" The Spanish version"" of the film because I am not the only one to talk about it."|0
This film has made e mad. I believe the original of this film ,'The Mask', was an awesome film, worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when i saw this, i thought again.This film has spoilt the whole idea of 'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother who is seven didn't even laugh, and he is into these childish movies, but this was worse. A load of crap!!|1
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured.|1
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb 's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (though not completely) ignored by media outlets. After the trial - in which the defendants were cleared of any wrongdoing - Leopold and Loeb appeared on CNN and other major networks. There was a lot of focus on their sex life, and the case seemed to be falling apart because of it. On CNN's Reliable Sources, host Don Lemon asked Leopold if he would still have the relationship with Loeb if he wasn't a pedophile.|0
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies as they try to reunite with their bodies in order to escape their final destination. This film seems to be a continuation of The Final Destination franchise in a way, so it’s worth keeping an eye on to see who gets to return to their body in the sequel. This movie looks like it could be really good, especially if they keep the same story in the sequels, which is always a good idea. What do you guys think?|0
Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.I know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a God. All great questions, But I really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed but come on.|1
First i got ta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code . sure , there are a ton of similarities , but it is a well-written movie and it's not all that easy to read, and you'll be glad when you're finished because you feel like a new person . Â it is definitely more fun to watch than its source material . I'm going to begin by saying that I don't love this film and I don't know why . Â I watched it twice and was disappointed at parts .|0
"Now for sure , this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and this is just another step in his evolution as a character, a role that is sure to impress the fans and it has already begun with his latest movie ""The Mechanic"" that is slated for an August release. Bruce Willis as The Mechanic in the film which stars Joanna Lumley

In this story , The Mechanic , the character of the same name is set in London in the 1980's and while working at a garage, he is brutally murdered after being beaten up by his friends."|0
"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $30,000."|1
Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious.|1
There is a point in the film where the female boss of the `` death machines '' ( a multi-ethnic group of terrorists) goes into a rage over how much her brother-in-law is taking out of the country. In the context of the movie, and the context of these terrorist groups, these people are just out to terrorize the whole world. I have to say it's very funny and funny in that context. The guy who runs an oil refinery in Yemen gets shot and killed by terrorists. The guys who do the bombings, or the ones who blow up other buildings, are terrorists.|0
Peter Strauss, by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films, often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, having channel-hopped into it half-way through. Well, I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film! !Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much....|1
This film SUCKS ! ! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random . Good gore but just like most of the flicks the gore is all over the place and it's like the director is trying to tell a story instead of giving the audience the story to read . It's also hard to read, it takes some time to figure out what is going on because it's in English but the dialogue is also in English. It would be better to have subtitles for the characters. Overall the plot is good but not so much for the gore and the dialog .|0
"Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the ""hilarious"" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage."|1
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book , Prozac Nation , and I wanted to share what I found about it with my readers. This book is based off of one of the most important books for the treatment of bipolar disorder; the book is called Prozac Nation and I believe that it will be very helpful for any bipolar person. The Prozac Nation book is a well-written book with excellent information on the importance of a balanced diet and taking a high quality Prozac pill. This book provides both short and long-term explanations on how Prozac should be taken.|0
The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat.|1
....OK, small-town, clueless sheriff? Check. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of sheriff's hot daughter, whom sheriff hates? Check. Corporate land developer who greedily puts profit over people? Check. Developer's rank-and-file accidentally unleashing a primordial monster, then being pressured to cover it up? Check. Natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were? Check. Amateurish CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check.|1
I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What were you thinking making three hours out of it? It may have a quite good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. It didn't have anything.It's got this strange, crazy science man with Einstein-hair, the classic thing. Not real at all. And a man keep getting younger all the time.|1
In case you dear readers never heard , this movie was the main inspiration for last year 's Samuel L. Jackson-starring Man Of Steel reboot. And it's still a very good movie to see, just like it was a really good superhero movie. You'll be glad to hear it's a lot of fun! First of all, I don't know where to start this review. First off, I loved the first two Superman movies. So I expected a lot more from Man Of Steel. Well, I guess it wasn't enough for me.|0
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity.|1
In 1929 , director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the Disney Studios' new animated short _The Lion King_ , which would be the first feature-length animated film to use motion capture . The technique allowed the animators to move their hands directly in front of a 3-D camera and thereby create a physical, believable illusion of characters moving and acting as if they existed in 3-D space. The technology had been used before for other motion-enhanced films such as _Ripley's Rock_ and _The Flintstones_. The technique was used in the 1930s for motion-enhanced features such as the _Caddies_ and the _Hercule Poet_ films.|0
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect . Unlike virtually any other film I can name I think that it manages to keep you on your toes and is not afraid to throw you a curve ball. In a way it has a lot of that action/suspense/surprise aspect that is lacking from most other films . I have to say that it is not as good as the first film in this list, but I think this is because I am much more used to seeing the first film in the film series and I find it much more enjoyable.|0
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that well thought out editing. I guess the only reason it got released as a feature was because of the name. But it's kind of stupid to release a film that isn't meant to be a commercial feature, even if it's one that could be sold to corporate studios. I guess it makes more sense for it to be released as something that is more like a special effects short, and not a full length film. I think this is a decent film.|0
I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie that I hate ... but this was the worst I've ever seen! I'd heard so much hype that the first movie in the original series would make a big comeback and I thought ... I'm wrong! There was a time where I would've loved this film if I thought I could win this ... but now I just can't! I think if you watched the previews you would think this film was great. You would like it because you would be happy with it and wouldn't expect it.|0
Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car), facing hard time in the Big House with some of the nastiest characters this side of a Russ Meyer pic. Blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout, and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity.|1
"While I hold its predecessor, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High,"" as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, ""The Wild Life"" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, ""From the makers of FTARH, something even faster."" This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, ""The Wild Life"" is, nonetheless, a great flick."|1
Ten years before `` The Matrix '' and hot on the heals of `` They Live '' came this brilliant and highly imaginative take on a familiar story. The film was released in 1998. The premise is that a man is trapped on a ship headed for the sun where he will have to make the choices that will lead to his death. The ship is called the Odyssey and the man is called Matrix. The ship is supposed to land in the middle of a desert planet in a year and a half where there is no surface, no water, and only one way to go.|0
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short. ""The Grinch"" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. I used to like him very much in his ""Waynes World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and ""the Cat In The Hat"" has just finished me off."|1
Having endured this film last night , I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal. Even if I’m not a huge horror fan, I will say that The Witch was one of those films that left a lasting mark on my life . It’s hard not to remember how much I enjoyed it and how much I wished I hadn’t bothered with it. I’ve since seen other films in the genre and it was interesting to see how much I didn’t have to wait to see it.|0
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. We all agree it shouldn't have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. If you do end up going, don't take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family!|1
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK, I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN’S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets! ), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)!|1
Whoa . I mean , whoa . I mean , whoa whoa.I saw this movie , waaay back when I was a teenager , a few years ago ? And then I reaally liked the characters . I don’t remember much . But I liked the story , the themes , the message , and I liked the actors . I also liked the film . I liked the fact , that this film had a message for me as a teenager . I liked that message . I went to the theater , and I was really excited .|0
"Loved this movie ! Kicking it old school ! Love the idea . Love the script . Love the characters . Well written . Can't wait until the sequel . This film was one of my favourite movies i've ever seen. My parents bought the soundtrack of the first film and i just loved the music. The movie was very interesting and very cool . I have a few questions i would like to ask about this movie and its sequels. Please help me with them. 1. Why the second movie? I am really curious

2. How would you describe the characters?"|0
This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school, this was required reading in both languages.I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story.|1
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. And that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. But this is beyond bad. This movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. First off, the CGI has to be one of the worst i've seen.|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff , but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself to a higher station than you've ever been at before. There are far too many of those in our culture and it is not in anyone's best interest to allow them to continue to exist. You don't have to like what the person doing the humor thinks they are doing or how the person doing the comedy feels about it, just don't give them the air time it takes to convince you that what they are saying is true.|0
Except for the glossy look , this show had little to recommend it . The writing was patronizing and convoluted , as it tries to convince us that we are wrong when in fact, it was simply a show that didn’t make it’s points . What was interesting about the show however were the people and characters they used in the show . At times they used people that I couldn’t stand and it made it hard for me to get through the show . The best part of the show however was that they managed to keep the show entertaining all the way through it’s run .|0
"As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments : In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the earthquake that hit there. A friend of mine was about to have a dinner with some friends and they were saying to each other, ""This is going to be bad. We'll have to evacuate immediately."" And the next day we read in the newspaper that there had been an earthquake which had devastated parts of India, including the entire city of Mumbai. We thought, ""Shit. We have to hurry. We have to get our family and stuff out."""|0
Get the CD instead . The show is tame , and the editing sucks . The crowd gets way too rowdy , the set is too long , the sound is out of control , and the energy is way to bad to be entertaining . It was really good , i would love to see a repeat of it . But this is the last time it will be done . You can stream it here . The show is free , you can also download the mp3's from itunes . I also have a podcast hosted on itunes that has the same material .|0
"Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It sure was no ""Later Day Saints."" The movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. But the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.Even though ""Kiss"" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for TV movie. Every scene is lighted like a department store."|1
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is , in many ways , a modern equivalent of Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities , in the way they describe what it might have been like in 18th-Century Britain. But unlike that novel, both of these novels are still set in medieval Britain. But while the two novels describe very different periods of British history, they do share a theme: the decline of the English monarchy and the coming of the modern age. Both books take place in London, which has become a modern metropolis, but there are significant differences.|0
Excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually.|1
"Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure of seeing a movie with good actors, good action, good dialogue and good story with a clear ending. This is the reason I became a cinema addict. I watch a lot of movies, but I find it very hard to get into cinema without having seen more movies than the next guy. But I don't mind. I know it will be great! Wednesday, September 12, 2006

I am glad that there is more than just the same old movies with the same old actors."|0
I've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it.I'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. That being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away.|1
"I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish . My aim is to help people who want to buy tickets or get more info about a film. If you can't get into a film, please tell me. Please note that this is NOT for people who have no idea what they are doing. My only aim is to get people who have a good idea about what they want to see to help me. If they have any questions, that is. Wednesday, September 30, 2007

I have been a fan of the British series since it started in 1973."|0
Televised in 1982 , from a Los Angeles production , this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage performance of a play. For the most part , it's in perfect shape , with no apparent damage to any of the original set pieces. All of the costumes are in excellent condition . However , there is one costume , on the ceiling of the stage , that does not seem in good working condition , nor do the props . It is also the only piece that needs any work , since this is where the actors are placed . The lighting , on this stage , is wonderful .|0
"Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan , I have to say that this film while not awful , just did not meet expectations , and that's what we should expect from such a well made project from the team at Kino. While it's certainly not a perfect film, there are still quite a few issues here and there that really leave a lot of questions unanswered. For me the most pressing one is that the ""story"" behind the story is so thin that there isn't really enough information to back it up."|0
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently, I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) , the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days.|1
I loved this film , Independent film-making at its best . The cinematography , pacing , rhythm , and acting are just amazing and it is definitely a film to watch . I enjoyed it , I recommend this film ! This is the second time I had to see this one on tv , and I liked this film quite a bit, I think that is because it is very entertaining , funny, but still very serious . This is a truely great drama , but I was very bored to watch it . I feel that if the film was a little longer , this would be a much more enjoyable watch .|0
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths . Well written by Shane Black , the film is executed very well . The story is well developed , the cast does a good job. This is an enjoyable film which you will probably watch a few times. It’s very good for an action movie . Very good suspense film . The acting is good . The cinematography is well done . There is a lot of atmosphere . I would recommend it . I love action thrillers , I feel like watching a thriller is what a thriller should look like .|0
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy.This movie is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. It's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success.|1
I was hoping to like this movie , to settle in for an evening of goofy fun . I like this movie, but I cannot seem to get into it. It is a fun little comedy flick, but I just find it boring. The dialogue is fine, and it has a pretty decent acting cast , but the acting in this movie just doesn't come together . I just don't find it funny . If you have seen this movie , you may find a few laughs here . But I will tell you this , I will be giving this film 3 stars.|0
Firstly , this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book , short story , novella , or anything else . This is my novel , written entirely from the first person view point of the character(s), who are all real people . I wrote this as a work of fiction , in which I do not take inspiration from anything , including the work of the authors of these various books. This novel is not the work of any writer , but is entirely the work of myself, and it is a work of non fiction .|0
"So many of us who are devoted to the ""art"" of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. Once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this."|1
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine.|1
"The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played this in a horror film. That question came up many times over the years. The answer to it always came with one word, ""No"", which is why I never watched it. This is one of those films I'm sure someone will love, I'm certain I did too. The question is, do you? If so, watch this film and I hope it will bring you back. It was a great film with some great characters, great music and some great action."|0
"I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. However I saw it on Irish TV recently and there was an added narration by Roy Scheider (""we're going to need a bigger boat!""). This ruined the film for me. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. I wonder at the new DVD version that has no Roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it."|1
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well. Compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. The plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which I cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture.|1
This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites . Castle has a nice performance as well . I was surprised that the gore was done in the first place but that’s what makes it so bloody . The special effect was done perfectly . I like that it’s not just a gore-fest . This film is really well shot and looks great . . I was pleasantly surprised that the special effect was done well . The acting was great . I liked how they shot the film so well .|0
"This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.Hilarity ensues.Like the ""Police Academy"" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes."|1
John Knowles modern masterpiece , A Separate Peace , are one of many subtle , and subtly is the watch of a man who loves watching movies. One such is this film about two soldiers in the desert. The two men in question are Tom (Jack Huston) and Ed (Edward James Olmos) . Tom lives alone and has never seen a woman , but he does see a lot of things. He has an idea , that if he could stay out in the desert with no woman to bother him , he can stay out of danger .|0
What ever happened to shows with united parental figures ? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as one another. One parent is always out to kill, while the other is always doing it for their own amusement. One parent doesn't like to share anything with their daughter. And when she has something her mom wants, and she's the only one being able to give it to her, her mother takes it and uses it. And then the dad tries to use it, and ends up having an accident, so she goes to the hospital, and they take her in the ER.|0
"Do n't get me wrong , I love most of Paul Schrader 's movies , so it was with sheer shock , surprise , horror that I watched his newest film "" The Fifth Element"" , it 's been out for only a few weeks , and I must say that I was not expecting much. In fact , when I saw the trailer , it wasn't what I thought it was . In it , a man ( Paul Scheuring ) is sent to a planet that is very cold , barren and barren , with no life on it ."|0
Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Mask of Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoir's 'The Southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money.|1
Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops.|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in a trust for this. I would not put much in a trust and if it turns out to be a great idea just don’t tell me and keep your mouth shut. I am just curious what you think. Not saying it is a good idea to be honest with the public. I am also curious what you would have put into a trust if it were not a good idea. I guess you are a trust investor.|0
This is a fantastic film . The acting is some of the best I 've seen . Tatyana Samojlova is great as she plays the role of her mother and the only reason why you won't see any scenes with Aleksander Gressen is because of his performance. He is the main actor and plays a very important character . He is a very cool character who makes you feel he knows his stuff . The story revolves around a young boy who grows up and gets into some trouble . He gets to the attention of some bad guys . They threaten to kill him and to kidnap his family .|0
I saw this turkey in the theater , but I had a good time . The special effects are n't bad , but they don't look as good as this turkey. My kids loved the turkey, we just had to have a few different kinds of cheese. My daughter was very excited about the whole thing, but I'm glad my son was not in the mood to be a big cheese. The turkey is so small , that it's hard to tell what is inside and you have to look carefully to know if it is a part of the turkey, or a piece of a chicken.|0

Today is the birthday of a guy who played a major role in shaping the future of the industry, as he has for a long time and will forever."|0
Monday , October 02 , 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do . We ordered Chinese food , then we got in his jeep , drank tea . I was a bit worried because I knew he didn't like drinking tea . But when we left the bar and went to see the ocean we both got a little drunk . He was so happy when we got back it was like getting married again . I was really worried because I knew he hated being drunk . We went to get the boat to take us back to Cebu where I had been going for the past 6 or 7 years .|0
I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. He's a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-jail TV interview.The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually MADE her serve it) .|1
Yes , thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie . The acting is below-average and the special effects are average as well . Even the story is average . I feel it is not worth a rental , i dont want to rent this rental . In the first part , the character's are average . The story is a little dull . It is quite confusing . I guess the reason for the reason is not clear . Now , I think this rental will be good enough for the movie. But in the next part , the characters are more interesting .|0
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an over used story but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days.|1
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt 's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing . Like a lot of things in this film, I'm not really sure what I want to write about . This is not the movie I expected but I had to see it. For a film about a man losing his mind because he believes his girlfriend stole his identity from another man in order to get a car, I think the film is surprisingly depressing . However, the movie does have a point. And I agree with that point .|0
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent.There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier.I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use.|1
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing and only one genre. Why is it called “the teen movie genre”? Because it is only one genre all teen films have in common? The same thing happens in TV series. Why the need of the teen TV genre? All of the shows are all based on one or two “things” that teens can relate to but are not as popular in real life. So why is there this need?|0
I love these awful 80 's summer camp movies . The best part about `` Party Camp '' is the campers get to be the kids in the movies . When you think about all the things going on during those 80 's , it kind of makes it seem like they were all real and the kids were just having fun . There was no acting involved and it was the real thing . This movie really captures what a normal 80 's summer movie would look like . So here is my review of the movie , ''Party Camp '' .|0
'The Shining ' has wit , visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson . 'Ausentes , ' however, is the sort of movie that you can watch for five minutes, but it doesn't have enough of them to matter . 'It's more of a documentary , ' Nicholson explained to us in a phone call from Chicago , where he's directing ' a remake of ' The Last Waltz . ' And the reason it was made was to tell the story of Jack , ' Nicholson recalled. 'The Last Waltz is not a film.|0
Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. Kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named Trigger Hicks! ), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Constantly-smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes Trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! No amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by R.K.O.|1
I generally LIKE Sion Sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. But sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. The plot makes only a whisper of sense. I think it was intended to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But the humor, such as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gory. I would say perhaps Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well.|1
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version.|1
If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields, and Chaplin. I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women?|1
Seriously engaging , intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best . Mean , gripping , moody and captivating . One of those rare books that will stay with you for days . In the end , you'll be hooked . A novel which is one of my favourites . It took me ages to get through the book as it is quite long, but once I did I thought it was the best I have ever read. The novel deals with two very different kinds of characters. The first is the protagonist of the story, whom we meet a short time after he arrives in the country.|0
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed . The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled itself. However, I did have one little problem I found very frustrating. The characters felt hollowed out and they weren't particularly developed. The only reason I can think this could be due to my issue was that they had no development and I don't want to make too much of it, so forgive me for not giving a full description of this issue, but let me just say, this issue really didn't do much for me.|0
"I recently rented this promising mini series , I did n't even know they had adapted it for television . It did n't have much to it , but I thought i'd review it anyway . As you will see from the description I have read it is still a bit confusing , so I'll go into that in more detail below. Plot

I watched the first episode, then went back and rewatched the first 6 episodes, which makes sense because it is more or less a sequel to episode 2. I liked it and didn't hate it."|0
"Based on a fairly bland ""best seller,"" this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't in it. The women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.The characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great."|1
"Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about two boys from different places who come together to make up a family and start anew. By
Jenna K. Smith
on July 2, 2017

Natile Portman is a talented musician who was raised by a single mother in a one-bedroom apartment on Long Island, New York, as a child. She played the clarinet as a teenager and became a professional clarinetist on her own in the early 2000s, but soon she began to work as a waitress at a local restaurant."|0
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute , a feel good Saturday night movie that could be a lot of fun but when I read the synopsis , I just didn't think it would be anything close to that. So , I ordered it and got the Blu-ray . Now I have to wait a little bit for it to get here . I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like it but that's just me . I think it's cute , just not what I was hoping for but I'll take it as a good thing I read it on the net .|0
"I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre.It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful.The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims ""Bunnyfluff!"" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!"|1
This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War -- most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the war’s defeat. It is the story of a young black boy from New York City who falls in love with an abandoned white woman. It starts off in the 1850s as a romance between two young people. In fact, it is based on an actual love affair between a young couple who both grew up in New York City, and is based on a romantic relationship of this kind that happened in New York during the late 1800s.|0
"Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed ""genius"" by anyone who watches it. Is that really what film has become? Or is it that any time someone says ""Wow, that is so cool"" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general."|1
Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know.|1
It is sad that some find this film worth watching. I am Russian, and I am disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive directorial work.|1
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'Redux' slapped on the end of the title  I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?Well it's not too hard to figure out really.|1
Is this a good movie ? No , certainly not . But for Jolie lovers it 's must-have . Her second directorial effort for Marvel Studios , The Post , will premiere in the UK on May 5 and will be the first Marvel film to be distributed by a British company . This is not the first time Marvel Studios has partnered with the UK . In fact it 's a big deal for Marvel 's British distributor , Sony , to have made Marvel and Sony as one of the first film distributors for the UK . Marvel Studios ' The Dark Knight Rises will also debut in the UK .|0
"I 've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was , perhaps , the hardest working lead actress of the 30 's. I saw her in all of her roles, from her days in ""Pillow Talk"" which was her second film and the only one that she was in. Her career was very interesting because she appeared in many different roles. From her time in ""On the Town,"" where she was a beautiful girl from Chicago to her role in ""The Girl From Broadway,"" the most beautiful girl in the '30's. She also was in many films that were never released in the states."|0
O boy, was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV.|1
While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying? ), but all in all and good time.|1
Certainly this film is not for everybody -- -but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period drama, this film will leave a lasting impression. It's about an American in Italy during the last days of World War II -- -and his journey as he tries to find the person responsible. But this is a war film as well, a story of survival in a time of war, and how men and women from different walks of life came together to fight for their lives. This film is well directed, well acted and very well paced.|0
Do n't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one . It is , but it's not really the sort of story I'd really be wanting to see. The whole thing takes place during World War I, in an area of Europe where the British are trying to suppress any sort of protest or uprising. There are various factions of people trying to get their hands on what is supposed to be a secret document that is used to justify British power in that region. It seems like a very interesting premise in itself, but it's not very interesting for the reasons I've outlined.|0
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie. It appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Alas, it didn't hold up.I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization.The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed.|1
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen . why is that their are always more white people than blacks. I find it hard to believe that this is always the case in all schools, and if you are black or a woman why are all your teachers always white? I feel that when I read about these issues that it makes it difficult for me to relate to this subject. It is as though I am the only black person in that school. Thank you very much for sharing your concerns and experience.|0
DO N'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the wall of my mind, it's the only piece in the house that's not covered by wallpaper. I don't really think of myself as a decorator... I'm not really sure if that makes me an amateur or something, but I think it's safe to say I'm an amateur. I'm not really sure what I like, what I'm good at, or where my true passions lie.|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C&W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, creepy former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave.|1
OMG what has Disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. Suite life of Zach and Cody are pretty good but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place suck and are unwatchable.Naturally Sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. Its about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. There all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful.|1
"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: ""Police Squad - in color"", you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you ever seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry."|1
If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston , it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin and Robert Mitchum . It might be that Huston’s caper comedies are better than Mitchum’s caper comedies, and yet in each case it is hard to avoid the impression that the plot is a little far-fetched. And yet that’s the problem with these comedies: There’s just no way to take them very seriously. For one, these caper movies are generally not the best movies about capers. Most of the time their plots are a little too obvious, and a little too straightforward.|0
Overall , I give this film a decent 7.6 . To start I 'll say I love how the character development comes so easy . I think all the characters are so good that I can't wait to see where the story goes . I do however have one gripe . This film starts off slow so I'm waiting to see more story before I give this movie a grade of 7.6 . A few scenes do leave you with questions . There's a lot that goes on that I'm not really a fan of. In fact this film has one of the worst endings in this entire series.|0
Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clichéd cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. Tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not Buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave. 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible film. It rips off so many other films (can you say Blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. The script is non existent.|1
I do n't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in , but I am guessing they are all in West Hollywood. If this were a legitimate movie, it would be a hit. If it was a fake rip off, you would have seen the trailer the first day, the second day and probably the first week of releases. It took about three weeks for this to drop for no reason and it was only because of the backlash against it that this movie got such a poor reception.|0
"While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography ( I thought a more purposeful approach would have been to shoot the film with the same actors on screen for most of it), I feel that certain shots are too ""staged"". One example is that there is a shot in Act 1 that we've already seen a couple of times on screen. But in Act 2, the camera doesn't linger on it. We see this shot again, but this time the camera pans across the stage and we see it in close-up."|0
"Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought ""Well if he likes it then I gotta like it!"" So I rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy)."|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines . One exception for this is “Jai Ho“, a Bollywood remake of an Indian movie “Jai Shri Ram” starring Aamir Khan and Riteish Deshmukh. The story of this film revolves around the life of Jai Ram (Aamir Khan) and his son (Riteish Deshmukh) and how the two of them grew up in a village that is full of injustice and corruption. It was a good and entertaining movie and I think most of the other films that are released today are the same.|0
I recently saw Episodes 1-4 , and now I ca n't wait for 5 & 6 to be available ! Now that I have a lot more episodes to watch, I'm actually looking forward to how it all turns out. There's just so much I could tell you about, so many things I could share. But I'll keep it short and sweet. This is the story of how I came to find out I'm a woman, and what's been happening to me and my life. I came to find out about my gender identity while I was a kid.|0
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want. I as a fan did not want a 1920's Evil Nazi movie. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, as we don't REALLY know what became of her. I also would have liked to get Ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing.|1
"After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It wasn't ""heartwarming"" or ""clever""; it was merely an amalgam of every other ""mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other"" movie ever made.The characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse -- We have the Blacks, the Hispanics, The Jews, The Asians, and the Homosexuals -- and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do."|1
Michael Bassett 's film 'Solomon Kane ' ( based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) was released back in 1996 and it received some of the highest scores on the film festival circuit. It also spawned numerous fan-fiction stories and comics. In the early '90s, there was some talk of making a feature film version of the story and in 1996 there was even a proposed script by Robert E. Howard creator Howard W. Cramer. He passed away prior to production, but the idea for a feature film continued to be thought about.|0
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow . I would not think about watching it again. I did not think it was that good. This movie was very bland and it did not have any storyline. I just left the theatre. I was not happy. I was annoyed with the movie. There is not much of a story line. There were so many scenes to keep the plot moving but it did not seem to be very long. I did not like the characters at all. There was not enough of them.|0
Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun.The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls.|1
"Wow ... I suspected this one to be bad ... But now I find myself just at a loss for words ... I have been in a rut for several months now, and I really don't even have words for how long I've lived in it ...

What I want to say is that over the years, there has been a trend. I guess I'm saying I've found that there is a lot of ""good"" in people and that's good. I guess there is also a lot of ""bad"" and that's even worse. You know?"|0
If you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. I understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature... no small feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end).|1
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose, one may ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.It starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only till the heroine forces herself upon them. Not once but twice.|1
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found that even the mighty IMDb didn't have it listed. That should have been all I needed to know.With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only one that I gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge.|1
I 'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott . I could 've done without the female nudity, but then, I don't watch the series, so I have no idea about it. I liked it better the second time around. I'm not the biggest Elliott fan (I love the first season more, though), but this show is definitely up my alley. I'm not really sure who to watch, but I will watch this series again, if for no other reason than for Sam Elliott (who I love!).|0
Let 's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché , as Korean romance dramas and movies go . First of all, the plot is so predictable , that one wonders how the director managed to get away with it . Next , there is a constant lack of love , even between the main couple , the two leads . In the beginning, there's little love between them , as the plot goes from the first time they meet , until the end . There is so much that is not in the movie , the plot has to be broken in two so the viewers will have a better idea of what happens next .|0
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I ca n't understand why I wanted to check it out, but now I'm in it and I'm really liking it. That is, I'm liking it a lot more than I thought I would. And I love it. I love, love it. It's the second film that I'm in and I'm not sure which one I enjoyed more. I loved the first one. And the second one was very good, which is what I've come to expect from the first one.|0
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long . The time is Thanksgiving of 1972, and I'm watching it on television because there is no one else there who knows what I want. The film tells the story of the two brothers in the family who were drafted into the military during the Vietnam War and are sent to fight there, but their experience is both harrowing and humorous. Their brother in the infantry (played by Gene Hackman in his best role ever) is a lieutenant in the Army's 4th Infantry Division.|0
"I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is ""Airborne"". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie."|1
I loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid, and then as I saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid, watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible.|1
Sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. The movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall. If the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non-stop for a week, the music will.|1
"Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic , but yet again its just another example of how people think the world should be , the only real question I have is if they have any proof that they exist at all and have no intention of trying to deny it , or have any proof of their existence either. ""There are many religions. I have a religion."" -George Washington

But I don’t know if I think it’s a good example or what you are saying. Is there a difference between religion and spirituality?"|0
"This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its content, for which it is not the whole story, and so is not a serious defense, as I shall argue shortly. But it may be useful in other ways as a warning to the general reader, and for some of my own more speculative purposes. The author begins: ""This is a short introduction to a book I wrote some years ago. Its purpose, as I saw it then, was to explain what was going on in America."|0
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies even get onto DVD. If I saw this in theaters I would get extremely upset. Bone Eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. It's the 'Bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.First of all I thought okay well the DVD artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label it looked scary.|1
As a parent of two girls(14 and 11) I have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake/Josh, Zac/Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work, paying utility,rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets,etc.|1
This movie is terrible , it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to make other people love her . This movie does not make you sympathise with Katie in a way it used to, it is all a waste of time , and I am pretty sure that if it had not been for the fact that the girl in this movie could be played by Megan Fox that the movie would not have been so disappointing . The only reason I saw this movie was because I was desperate to see Katie in action. The acting in this movie was a disaster.|0
This movie really is that bad, and I'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through every title from Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form.|1
From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES ( 1983 ) , comes its even more preposterous ( if not more so) successor THE VAMPIRE BAR ( 1998 ) , which has become a cult film and has become the highest grossing film of all time. The film stars John Turturro as Peter Parker, aka The Spider, who becomes one with a new breed of Vampires and becomes obsessed with killing people. This new breed of Vampires are more evil and more bloodthirsty than their predecessor, but it is their desire for blood that is the driving force in the movie.|0
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left in awe of the technical brilliance of each film. It’s quite hard not to fall in love with them, even if the films themselves were pretty underwhelming. We’ve seen a few Mad Max films over the years, but not like this. There are a lot of good ones, but there are way too many. For the longest time I just thought, “Man, they’re all good films.” I mean, it’s difficult enough just to see one in a cinema.|0
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be . There is no story whatsoever , no story line and there is no actual acting and I found it boring. I've been wanting to see it for awhile, but was too busy. Then I watched it and found out there was no plot. I'm not sure I liked it, but I found it boring and didn't care. This film is not really well done. I had to stop watching it in the theater because I could tell there was a story there, but no real plot.|0
I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves).|1
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge, some patience, a little luck and some time to sit down and do it all. For the last few years, Bog Creatures has done an amazing job of putting the best of the best into the world of video games. Whether it’s a great looking, well put together, original game, a well thought out strategy game, or just a fun game of choice with a good story, Bog Creatures has got it.|0
There are so many things wrong with this movie I do n't even know where to begin . The story line is great , but then again the whole film just looks like a movie , not the real life thing . Â The only thing that I could really come to a consensus is that the whole cast looks like they would be hot and horny in the same room with a woman , then I thought I would throw some more money at the production company . Â Well , the cast looks as if they will be just as horny as a woman they will meet in the movie .|0
"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great! ""The King Of Queens"" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves."|1
Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I've had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance by the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.|1
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him, that earthy, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go.But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just isn't.It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven, its point of view is muddled, the acting is all over the board, from naturalistic to over the top.|1
I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition . It was billed as the story of a man who had sex with a dog, and when his wife finds out, it will destroy their marriage. I just finished reading it and I am absolutely appalled by what they did in this movie. If you watch it, you will find out what the problem was and what happened to the couple that had their marriage shattered. And I don't think it was very good. At first I believed that there was something wrong.|0
"The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately ""interesting"" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the ""in crowd"" and eventually starts hanging with them."|1
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry , a charming young woman becomes a vampire . Not only does she become a vampiric vampire but she’s also born into a family of vampires , which means that she’s even more of an enigma than ever before. When a man takes over her life, however , all bets are off . Will she be able to turn back time ? Will she even have the chance to choose between her loved ones ? Will she be able to find out the truth about her past, about her origins ?|0
"Do not see ""Mr. Magoo."" It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny in it. He has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the entire movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have stayed that way."|1
Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the rabbit's hole. So Bug's has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one, if still shorn of a classic.|1
Found this film for one dollar ( $ 1.00 ) and the film was a complete waste of time . I can't believe this was the only movie that I saw, it was boring , I watched it twice and the whole time i was just annoyed with it . If you don't like this movie , don't waste your money . I didn't even like any of their last movies . Not a bad film. The only disappointment was the ending. There was so much potential that came out of that film. But, to me, it felt like a wasted opportunity for them.|0
This is , for different reasons , a very very bad action movie . First of all , Seagal is not one of the biggest stars and I am not saying this in the way that you should expect me to say , ‘this guy is not a star !’ , but it’s very easy to miss this . But , what is even worse , this is not a great action film . There’s not much to talk about this movie and I will only talk about the bad points and how it’s not good .|0
"Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out the sister is part of a Jim Jones type religous cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. This is another (!) cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if not for Lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior ""The Man from Deep River."""|1
The greatest tragedy man faces is that , capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this book the reader learns that the greatest of these banalities of life is man's inability to get the real meaning and purpose of life. The real tragedy is in the heart of all of us, because man, who has such tremendous potential, so often gives up on it and settles for the banal. The greatest of these banalities of life is that our greatest need in life is our greatest happiness, because this alone is worth the striving and the sacrifice we have made for it.|0
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, Washington's is OK, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-stretched CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (Some Spoilers hereafter!)|1
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Indeed, his sort of daft giddiness bears, to this writer, the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when Mickey is holding down the button in the Tardis), yet brings his own aloof superiority a la McCoy's Doctor as he lets events coalesce around him.|1
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. A group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster.|1
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z.|1
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks have perpetrated, I felt like I had just escaped from a horrible disease. At a minimum, Ron Howard and Tom Hanks should go to jail for their crimes against humanity, and possibly even be tried in a foreign country. But there are a lot of other things that have gone wrong in this country that I’m not really talking about. This is the second time I’ve watched this movie, and even the first time was pretty terrible.|0
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off . Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, there were probably some blaxploitation scenes in the making . . . The first time I got to the theatre with my daughter was the first time we were able to see the movie without the kids sitting in the aisle . . . so, I'm guessing . . . it's probably a good thing that I didn't know about the blaxploitation in the film . . . I loved this film, it was an interesting movie that had some great scenes, and it made a great statement about America.|0
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised . As the title suggests, this particular story has been twisted and distorted so as to fit into the Scarlet Pimpernel's own twisted and deformed vision of the past and future. But, by the very fact that it's been twisted and distorted, there is something to be gained from reading it, at least in part. For, as I said, by its very being so twisted, it's a story that shows the twisted and distorted side of man.|0
"This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by ""Friday the 13th"". ""The Prey"" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.But ""The Prey"" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason."|1
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?|1
On the positive , I 'll say it 's pretty enough to be watchable . On the negative , it's not much better than the first movie , which really was the best thing about that first one . The second movie , at least , I didn't really care for . There's no doubt that the movie has it's moments and moments are there, but this movie is simply not worthy of this movie. I don't understand why so many people feel the need to say this. There's a whole lot of great entertainment out there.|0
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago , and it remains one of my all-time faves ! There was something about the script that really grabbed me, something that really made me think that this movie should be on the big screen. I’ll admit that this movie could have been perfect and just be an excellent movie, and it would have had no trouble pulling it all off ,but that would have been to miss a special moment that should have made it one of the best films ever made.|0
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he still has plenty left to give to the world. He has been the most overrated superhero in Hollywood for a long time now, and his last movie is not a bad thing, so it is safe to say that he still has plenty to give to the world. However, he is still not as popular as Superman and Iron Man, despite what is said. He is not as good as his predecessors in that department, but that is not the worst thing in the universe.|0
"I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting, and thought ""hmm, can't be too bad."" Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was ""not too good"".Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."|1
You thought after `` Traumschiff Surprise '' that German comedy ca n't get worse ? It can . This comedy, which was released at the beginning of January, is an abomination . It is the worst, worst comedy ever to come out of Germany . When it comes down to it it is about as bad a satire on German society as can be produced. I have no idea why the Germans are so obsessed with the Nazi Party. Maybe they are a bunch of weirdos who think Hitler was a great role model, but it is hard to see any difference between the Nazi and the Hitler Youth.|0
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sound familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this has got to sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just have a heart attack and die from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades? wet bandits?...oh wait, that last one's been used) try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled (Druish?)|1
Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place.|1
"This film is a nightmare! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished watching this movie: ""UffOK, it ended, what a relief!"" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a B-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it not an excuse to be so bad! I've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! This one got nothing of it!"|1
I realize most people do n't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much older audience and that this may seem like a cheap shot, but it is one and it does show the depth that a character like this can bring and it is very much needed to have this film. I do not know if I will ever understand the life of the man but I know there is much more that I would like to see. The film is very well made and I will definitely give the film 3 stars because of the great performances.|0
In `` Red Letters '' , Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a new girl in her class that she needs to stop reading his letters. At first, she takes him at his word when she asks why he doesn't write back. However, after Coyote shows her around the town, she begins to feel that maybe she is a little bit in love with him. After she finally tells him she loves him, she doesn't quite believe him when he says he doesn't feel the way he used to.|0
Unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible.|1
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff . One of the greatest movies of all time. A classic that still holds the public's imagination. I think this film has the potential to make anyone fall in love with war. I can't wait to see how it will turn out. The best part for me is when we get to the ending scene. I always wanted to watch it in order to see the ending. Now that I can do that, I don't see that as much anymore. But it's a good part of the movie.|0
Excerpt from TV GUIDE:This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra.This is typical, lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. The Captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor.|1
"I'm an action movie fan but until today I've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" on pay-TV hoping for nothing special.But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.The transformation of Samantha/Charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I've ever seen."|1
There were many 'spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s , and although this has a strong basis in the westerns , it is still not the first or the last film of its ilk , but one of a kind . I am not the only one who have seen this film which I think has been made by at least 8 other filmmakers . It is the one I think I am best placed to describe as a western , and it is a good film in many ways . Not all of the westerns are bad , I can remember watching many of them , some of them very well .|0
Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the film.Cobb doesn't know it, or doesn't let himself realize it, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the business from union organizers.Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. He's shocked -- shocked!|1
"This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is especially awful; it really appears that the editor (if there was one)literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. The opening has to be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know there are ""B"" films - but are there ""H"" films? If so, this one's an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan."|1
"I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. While I was familiar with his better known compositions (""One is the Loneliest Number"", ""Without You""), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. If you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him."|1
"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who . I 've played them over and over again as a child and my friend asked me if I had any of this. I don't know anything about the show and couldn't find any of the DVDs or videos I thought I had, but I do play them for my friends. I would love to know what is in this series. Thank you very much in advance

I'm sorry I don't know much about the show, I never got the chance to watch it."|0
I 've seen a few bad action movies in my days , but this one 's just plain awful . I actually don't understand the logic . I was surprised how many people didn't know what this was about , so this review will just be based off the first 10 minutes of the movie . In that first 5 minutes we see a couple of guys fighting against a guy with a grenade launcher . The one who holds the gun and is about to do the killing , but is killed by a friend of the gang .|0
Let's get one thing straight: I like much of Snipes' work. Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. This film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either. In fact, if I never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! It's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film.|1
First , let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel , so maybe I am directing you wrong. I have read all the others, and I still have a very hard time describing them in the way I do here, but I will give you a hint. It is very rare that we see a scene with two people, and in this scene there is also a person, who is a complete stranger, but who comes up with a plan that would change the way that we think about a number of things and in this way , I will try to explain it in some way.|0
*SPOILERS INCLUDED*Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay a homage to Hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie.|1
Right ... so you have a dam , tons of water ( that seems to flow really really slowly ) and there are no fish, so the fish just sit around in the mud for a few weeks ... it doesn't get much worse ... and then suddenly, there are fish everywhere and they start fighting with one another , so it's all the same to me, the fish are gone, except for the slime that is left on the mud ... and there is no fish around anymore, which seems really sad to me !|0

A kooky , but funny bit of diversion . You kind of have to see it from the beginning to appreciate how good it is . It makes you think . You never thought you could make a film like this . But you know you can , and you have . It has all the ingredients you need to make a good film . I like it as much as I do any of the works I saw and I am hoping to make the film a lot better . And that’s where it is at the moment , you know what I mean ?|0
"Waters 's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope , and then when/if something pops up , like a star, or a meteorite or a volcano . . . but, it's also a lot of fun. And, like all things, there's always an unexpected twist. In a recent interview, Waters said , ""One day, it will all be mine,"" 
which would make for a good title for a film, don't you think? If it is , then I'll just have to do it . ."|0
It seems to be a common thing in the 90 's to play with cliches . Some manage to do it well, some can do it well but still end up being annoying. It’s one of those things in a game where you never know what to expect until it happens . It’s like when you play a game before you are a seasoned player and you’re amazed how well you knew it. In one such example, we’ve recently seen people do a double take when they discover a certain mechanic is used.|0
This movie was , perhaps , one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I 've seen in a long time. The plot of this film is so stupid it is not worth mentioning. All I know is that it was one of the very worst movies that I saw that I 'm ashamed of being a fan of at this time. This movie is so bad it makes me wonder if there is more to the story than what is there. I mean, I didn't know how the movie was gonna end, and there were no clues that I did.|0
"A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope that's what they were going for because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been."|1
Without John Rhys-Davies , I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter . But in fact, I really enjoyed it . If you're looking for what the future of film is coming to, you should definitely check out this documentary, which follows the making of the first feature film shot entirely in the UK, and of course I've got the full review right here . This is an excellent documentary film that you'll need to have on your DVD collection . We start with a short introduction to the film, which basically says it all .|0
While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) I must say that I thought the script and acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has crafted a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven delight. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. Her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet Bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open.|1
"This is absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset. The acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. The end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care. The one exception to this is the lead character ""Joe"" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!)"|1
"This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious ""In The Realm Of The Senses"", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever."|1
Unlike one of the reviewers below , I do n't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead. I think that it should be a lot simpler, that it should be a lot better for people who want it. And I think this is what we have to do. I think that if we have the right mix and match of the right skills, people should be able to make it at the level that they want. And I think this is what we should be striving for, a mixture of the right skills, the right personality types, the right experience.|0
When watching this movie , with it 's deterministic cause and effect , wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment , can be frustrating. This movie doesn’t hold any surprises , and in the end I had to laugh and shake my head. But I really like this movie . It’s very good at what it does best . It gets right to the point and it doesn’t gloss over any plot holes. This is a film that is well made , and is full of heart . If you are a movie fan or a fan of science fiction I would recommend this movie to you .|0
to make this short and sweet : i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the horror franchise! it's not so much of a remake as a slight change of scenery and a fresh approach to the storyline. the movie starts out a bit slow for the first 2 acts but gets going in the 2nd act : a good idea for a horror movie! I think the movie is quite enjoyable. The story is a bit confusing, at the same time it's not really that bad either, but it's not that good either.|0
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ""The Origin of Species"", so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's ""Creation"" got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.I guess that the movie overplayed Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma."|1
It 's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of young children. It is, however, a rare marriage between a man and a woman that is truly happy and well-balanced. That is what makes this film so interesting. It tells the story of two parents whose relationship is, in effect, perfect but has one problem – a problem that keeps coming up time and time again, and yet they manage to still be happily married. It is the problem that makes this family story so interesting, and one that the film never lets the viewer forget about.|0
This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The ending is so much the better for being untidy.|1
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in denial. This generation had no idea what it was getting itself into. I don't think it's a big surprise that many of those who did not come of age in this era did not even know the term 'tween-teen.' I was just in my teens myself at that time and I have no desire to go back and forth from the past. It's just a fact of life that those in the past know better.|0
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh??? - What???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version.|1
After a very scary , crude opening which gives you that creepy `` Chainsaw massacre '' -feeling , everything falls apart and we go back to the last thing we see before we are all killed - an old guy, who seems to be very sad and in pain, walking up to him, asking if he remembers what happened last night . The guy tells him he does, and says , `` I can't stop thinking about what you did ... '' - and he then takes a knife with him . This guy is in a long-term depression and he takes his life at this point.|0
I remember watching Police Squad ! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a great show. It didn't take long for it to become a hit and now it's one of my favorite shows. I can't help but think how great it would be if it were to get the same attention and love now that it did in the 90s. Here is a clip I liked. This is the last bit. I think that it is good enough for a clip. I don't know why I didn't think of this one.|0
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. This film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way.|1
Oh boy. Films like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close to truth, then I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a time before WWII started. In the movie, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Well I can't imagine that Rommel wouldn't have known something about Hitler's government policies so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life at the end a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him?|1
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director . My feelings about both of his films were rather mixed up . To be honest , I just didn't like this film . My initial feeling was very negative , but my thoughts were later corrected . This film does a really good job at giving you the feeling of how a place smells and feels , but it doesn't quite do the job it should . I know many people who enjoyed this movie . So if you don't like this film , then don't waste your time and make this one your next film .|0
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. Well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I don't really see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant.Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other great performances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II, and Hoosiers).|1
"This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957 . In fact , despite Ed Wood , Jr.and his dreadful voice acting , I don't think this is the worst film of his career . I was actually quite entertained by "" The Day the Earth Stood Still "" , a movie made for TV and starring James Garner. The story is set in a dystopian future where the United States became a police state and most of the population was forced into labor camps. Many young people were drafted into the army , which is where Garner is found."|0
Sorry about the `` extremely clever '' summary phrase . I do n't know what I was thinking , but I didn't expect that . This was all a surprise to me as I didn't think there was a good chance that any of them were going to be up for a contest. ( I don't think I would have read the other articles . ) My guess is, as you all suggested, that they might be. That's my take on the matter . But my guess is that if they are, that the site is going to be very competitive .|0
If any movie ever made Italians look bad , this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A -- HOLE . I am so glad there is a DVD that doesn't need the internet to watch it on. I had seen this movie before on DVD , but wasn't sure if anyone else had. The DVD is a little bit more difficult to find and is only in English language. The only good news is that the movie is not available on the I-VOD network. The only other place that I was able to find the film on my computer was from a DVD and I have to say I really enjoyed it.|0
I found it hard to care about these characters , who were either annoying or insipid , all living their own lives , who were always looking for a friend to hang out with , but they never really came across as human beings . The most annoying part is that they all seem to only have 1 thing in their lives . All living together , always hanging around , never really getting along , never having any real relationship with one another . They were all always complaining about the other person , but they never seemed to have any real interest in anyone outside their little circle .|0
This is no walk in the park. I saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt like I'd been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded.|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie . Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending and shaping to become a famous artist . He is a nice guy, who has a love for music but has a hard time dealing with the reality in the modern art world . He has to find his place within the world and make a name for himself . Stephen is still young and still has much to achieve in the art world . The world is not ready for an artist with such a big heart like him .|0
"""Hardbodies 2"" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add ""brainless"" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in ""The Big Doll House"")."|1
"I'm originally from Brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. They told his life story and he never got one ""centavo"" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in Brazil. Sad... but that is the world we live in. It's about making money not saving lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most probably... dead. We tend to want to live in this ""Disney filled fantasy bubbled life""."|1
"The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960 's Broadway musical that became famous because the lead male character's name came from a line in the lyrics of ""Kiss the Boys Goodbye"". It starred an actor who went on to appear in the original cast of '80s film classic, ""The Color Purple"", but who has not had a film in a couple of years. Now that the film musical is making a comeback, we're sure we can expect some new faces to join the talented cast of the film musical."|0
I found this movie to be a big disappointment , especially considering the cast . The characters are not believable, and the story is a joke . I felt the movie was really boring, and did not have a good ending . The whole story is pretty pointless, the main character dies after a while . The plot is a total mess , and this is not a bad movie, it’s just disappointing . Overall , this movie was great , just not good , and it’s disappointing . I think the movie was good , but the story was not .|0
"Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports ""it takes a village to raise a child"" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress."|1
Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed.|1
OK , to start with , this movie was not at all like the book . I read the book years back and then watched the movie. And I loved the book more than the movies. But I have seen the book and movie twice so far and have not gotten bored at all. So here it is . It took me quite sometime to actually enjoy this movie. But I am very happy with the movie and can't wait for the 2nd movie. This movie has the potential to be the very next best movie of 2016.|0
"It's painfully obvious that the people who made this ""movie"" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish.The movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever. I'm SURE that I could make a better movie with my friends. To me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much."|1
"Movie Title - TartDate of review - 5/26/02Year of movie - 2001Stars - Dominique Swain , Brad Renfro , Bijou)Director - John Carpenter
This movie follows the adventures of John Carpenter's evil robot ""The Master"", which is trying to conquer the world, but first, it has to find a way to defeat the Master himself. The story revolves around the events of the movie, with each character being portrayed by a different actor, with each one of the actors playing both sides of the story as well as their own."|0
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old Hollywood films. The movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms.|1
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a house in West Hollywood, a wife and a child of his own. However, he is not exactly living the great American dream - he is broke and homeless and can't seem to keep up with his mortgage payments, which in some cases can be five times what he owes. This is not the life Russel thought he would have at the beginning of the 21st century, so he had to change his life before it is too late.|0
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. The odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. Supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.It is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied.|1
This movie contains real animals been killed , like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been shot in front of a fire and a lion have to be taken from the forest and a cat and a snake have a meeting with a man. I know some of this story was made for TV and I do not remember it. I think this movie might be a great movie but I dont know because I did not have enough time when I made this movie. I hope I can remember this movie now because this is the kind of movie you would like to watch.|0
"As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie ( keeping it kid friendly ) FX was very bad, story very bad, I think the only really interesting thing about that movie was that the main character was a guy with a gun and no explanation as to why. I think even with a very poor story you can make a movie with bad plot and still have that same level of badness

I agree it was a bad movie because it was terrible, the characters were awful and it was awful as a story."|0
Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up.|1
"Korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's ""Mister Lonely"" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion."|1
Harmony Korine . I 'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film . If it was just to give the fans something to be sad about . I'm pretty sure all of those people he was talking to were not even in the same country . What the hell was he doing there ? What did he have to say ? It's just so stupid . I know he was upset about all the hate he got . If that's the case , why did he go there to talk to the haters ? It's not even a good movie .|0
"I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there's not one ounce of ""cool"" in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than ""boy meets girl,"" the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes."|1
While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years , there have always been rivals to their creativity. There have been numerous studios over the years producing cartoons and animated features based on fairy tales and the children's stories of all nations of the world. In recent years Disney have been in the lead, but even now, there are competitors. In the last 5 years we have been treated to some fantastic animated features and animated movies based on animated classics and animated cartoons that are part of our heritage, such as The Lion King, Cars 2, The Muppet Christmas Carol and Frozen.|0
A great performance by Emily Grace ! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious about what this was about so I popped the DVD in. I'm not the type who's always in the mood for big action, but I have a couple of favorites in this movie that I love so I'm very excited for the rest. Emily Grace's performance was the highlight. I was worried she'd be a little heavy handed here and I think I was wrong. Not only was the performance outstanding, but the movie itself was a huge improvement on the previous releases.|0
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film is going to end.The premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.Uhh ..no.The main problem is this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz its boring!|1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate . My nieces have watched it non-stop since they 've found out it came from a cartoon . And I am glad that they will have this for a very long time . So many good things ! I am really glad that we get a movie based on a book . One of my favorite characters is a guy who always wants to be on top of the other person so he can kiss him . This guy is such a wonderful person and I can just imagine them doing all sorts of good things together .|0
Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says `` stay away from this movie '' . We are not talking a little voice, but a very strong one . And what does it say about you if you do not heed its warnings ? Well, you will have to wait for the film. But before we begin to discuss the storyline, let's discuss the characters and their story .

"Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon,""High Sierra"",'41 along with Robert Ryan,(Howard Wilton),""Golden Gloves"",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection."|1
When I stepped into the theater, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S.|1
Just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up.........|1
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does.|1
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 . Guy Madison leads the way with a script that is full of surprises, including a romantic subplot and a love triangle, all wrapped in a thrilling musical number. The movie's musical score is also a great example of John Williams's work on the film, and is a highlight of many film soundtracks of the time. There are several scenes that were deleted from the film due to their violence or sexual content, so if you are interested in the deleted scenes that made the film, you can check this out .|0
"Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. The only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). The dialogue...the plot...if this ""movie""(and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this."|1
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I 've seen a duff film . I've probably been there before myself . That's the only time I know about the IMDb . It's a shame, as it would have been nice to actually see a film . There were some good films . I can't name them, but a few I'd like to include . The first two are definitely on my list, the last one was not . The film that came to my mind the best is . The first film that comes to mind is .|0
"""Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of ""nanny""."|1
Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. For starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster.|1
A lot of 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents... stuff fell into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing.|1
the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience.|1
This was a nice film . It had a interesting storyline , that was executed pretty well in the later half of the movie. But the acting was not that great . I was not a fan of most of the actors in the lead roles. The only actor I liked was William Shatner , his voice actor . And there was not that great chemistry between them . And not that bad as a whole . But the plot was just plain silly . I do not really understand what they were trying to get to . I just did not enjoy the story .|0
The minutiae of what 's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of them. You need to take all of your belongings with you, and you need to keep an eye on your belongings to make sure you don’t leave any of them on the street. You don’t want to make the cops suspicious that you have anything that they can’t see. The only other thing that you want to be certain about is the location of all of your belongings, including the money.|0
In Michele Soavi 's confusing art-house zombie film , Dellamorte Dellamore , Rupert Everett plays Francesco , a caretaker in an Italian village who works to save the dying. Everett, who made his film debut here in 2004 with the horror-comedy The Sixth Sense , is an actor-slash-director who has made horror and science-fiction movies since he was in his twenties. He has been working in the New York indie film world since the mid-2000s, including a couple of films that are still going strong, and he's been making horror movies of all genres for years.|0
"You thought after ""Traumschiff Surprise"" that German comedy can't get worse? It can. This comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... The real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men."|1

Simply put , Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable . The movie is less about the raw science of evolution, and more about their relationship . I don't mean to say that science can't make a good film. A good science movie can make me feel very passionate about something, but I wouldn't want to see such a film if I had to watch it for its science content alone. But there is another, perhaps even larger, issue at stake in this argument, which has nothing to do with the content of the film.|0
If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli `` Okkadu '' you will find this to be very similar. The story of `` Okkadu '' revolves about a young man named Rama who goes to stay with Vyas, his mother's brother who is an officer in the royal army. This story begins with an old man and his son playing chess at night, when their chess set is broken and the pieces scattered about the ground. This is when Rama comes and takes pity on the old man.

One of the movies i just DIDN'T want to see. I got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.Also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.|1
Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets: a walkman, and nudity from Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked there is absolutely NO reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that one. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.|1
This movie was completely stale and uninspired . The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical characters talking about their problems . It was just boring. The only reason the audience could care about any of it was the last 30 minutes of the movie . They got what they wanted in the ending. It was not exciting or thought provoking, it made me want to just leave the theater. Not because I didn't like it, but because I don't think the movie did a very good job at telling a story that I could care about.|0
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat all their children to their very own haunted house. It turns out that this isn't the only house that has come to their door, for there's been a strange visitor in town in the middle of the night... I'm looking forward to reviewing this one, as it was one of the few books that I thought I wouldn't like, but I enjoyed it. The characters were well-drawn and their personalities were believable.|0
Robert McKimson 's 'Acrobatty Bunny ' is one of the director 's finest shorts . Although the circus-based setting may not be very familiar to most viewers . McKimson gives the audience an inside look into what it's like to work in an animal circus. This film was awarded Best Short at the 2009 Golden Globe Awards and won Best Comedy at the 2010 New York Film Critics Online Award. McKimson also made the feature directorial debut of The Circus, a film which also earned Best Picture at the 2012 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Subject.|0
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending ( or maybe a Crying Game ending ) and the soundtrack was the bomb. Well that's a wrap. I will continue to watch it for a bit, and I will update this review accordingly. I love this movie so much. I hope the DVD release will happen. This has to be the most perfect movie I have seen in a LONG time. It had all kinds of characters, they all have their roles, the plot is interesting, and there are some great scenes.|0
I 'm a Christian , and I have watched pretty of Christian movies , but this one is too bad to watch .This movie is really bad in my view . First of all the movie starts in time ,but the movie does not stop .It's really bad , and so far it's the second biggest disappointment for me of all Christian movies .So I really want you to give this movie a fair rating , if you really want to see a Christian movie . If you want to understand what happened in the first movie, you are not going to read the whole article.|0
"Saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played ""Noel"", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good."|1
"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE."|1
`` Admissions '' is a fine drama even though they 're are some problems with the ending . Lauren Ambrose , the daughter of one of the biggest crime families in the state, is about to become a mother. This is the story about her life . The movie is directed by and is based on , and features the actress and her daughter . This is the third part of the popular series . The sequel will also have her in it and she will star as well . This is the last time I see her in this type of movies .|0
"Waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.And after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's ""rubbish bin for totally useless things"". One single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.CB is etremely campy, and intentionally so. The usual JW stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, overacting etc."|1
"I love this movie. Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called ""big fat liar"". Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. I don't think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is."|1
A Chicago couple , Dillon and Dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . People begin to wonder why they would kill a child. They wonder why they killed her? Did she say something she didn’t like, or maybe she was just trying to get away from her father? Did the child say something about his parents? Did they have any problems with their parents in the past? Or was it all a mistake? We know nothing about what happened to the girl. Dillon and Dougherty are both married to the same woman . They also have children.|0
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller . It´s definitively NOT a gripping suspense movie . There are plenty of tense situations, but the movie is neither suspenseful nor interesting . This movie just does not have any mystery or intriguing plot. It´s just too predictable. The story is almost identical to a typical action thriller which I have also seen many times before . In this movie you are basically watching two people involved in a relationship and trying to outsmart a killer . It starts out with the police finding a body that looks like a woman and they believe that it could be a murder .|0
This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.|1
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along.|1
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in Aberdeen.1st off Im not a big Sci-Fi fan (baring Star Wars) I was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, I was presently surprised.|1
I usually do n't categorize a moving as boring . I am not big on action flicks and my senses are just not trained to keep my mouth shut about it . I prefer films that are . . I did not go to school to do anything but dance . I have been dancing in public for years . I am a dancer by profession . My favorite dance was ballet . The only film I have seen in my entire life that I did not like is The Great Escape and I think that is because I liked it too much at the time because I watched it on the way home from a ballet lesson .|0
This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince.|1
"Love this little film , that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem , SHALL WE DANCE ? ( or at least the English version )

I first saw the gem in English on YouTube in 2007 and have been a fan ever since, as the original Japanese is worth watching in its own right. Now I’ve seen a new Japanese version (which I have yet to watch) in Japanese and found it really well made, in both English and Japanese, and so I thought I might give this gem a go, too!"|0
TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids.|1
"this film was probably the best ""scary film"" i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer, you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry."|1
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late?While not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this film was created) HOPPITY is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality.|1
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team , only to learn they had no idea what really happened...

Tuesday, September 20, 2010

This episode, as well as next week's episode, may be a precursor to the next season of The X-Files, but we have to wonder how we're going to get through it. I'd like to think the writers will take this story and get to the meat and potatoes of this investigation, but we have to remember, this show has had the potential to be something special."|0
This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. The special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. It is a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart.|1
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has very much of.|1
"`` Mr. and Mrs. Smith '' is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock 's movie . In the story, Mr. Smith (James Mason) is on a train heading back to New York City in the aftermath of the Great War when he has a startling and disturbing encounter with his wife (Mackenzie Fenton), who is also returning to New York City. Mr. and Mrs. Smith '' has a lot to it . I can't give it all at once . ""It begins in a car on the train. In a car on the train."|0
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan , loyal retainer Kogenta ( Jun Fujimaki ) , now known by his birth name Koga no Hiyori ( Jun Kunihiro ) , goes on the run from the invading forces of the usurper's brother , the evil Lord Sado , and returns to the village of Koga . Kogenta and the rest of the townspeople, however , are determined to fight on. When Kogenta gets into a tavern fight , a fight with a drunken Sado ( Eiji Kawai ), they are saved by an angelic being, the Lord of Heaven , who gives Kogenta a weapon .|0
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo-like madness.The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken.|1
Oh what the heck , I 'll reveal the secret : this movie stinks ! Yeah there are some nifty moments and it's a blast to watch, but don't let it take away from it's overall greatness! This is a film I'll have a lot of reasons to recommend to any movie goer. The only thing I might be missing is more of the plot lines and action scenes from other films. The film is a bit slow, and I thought there was a bit more in the way of plot twists, but I still love how it moves.|0
"I thought that this movie might be a good spoof , or at least a good independent comedy like Friday the 13th. It would be so much funnier than Friday. But it's not. There's so little humor in it, that it can only be funny to those who know how to laugh, and it is the worst movie in this list. If you're not laughing, then you're just wasting your time, so skip this movie. 3 comments:

I don't even remember what the movie is about!"|0
Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life.|1
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie . But Weber’s production seems to have hit the mark in every department and it shows in the movie . It is not the first time I have said that but this is a movie made with passion and effort . The movie tells a good story . The dialogue is very well acted by the main actors and the plot line is simple and easy to follow . But Weber’s production gives us more than what it is capable of doing . I really liked the music .|0
It 's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters . But it seems like they have changed it since the film's release . The story is still about these characters . But now there is a bit more action . And they also wanted to give the audience the impression that they are fighting some kind of a war . . . So there are two war stories . The first is a war between two different kinds of men . . . but it has very little in common with the other kind of war .|0
You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).The story is really touching and hats off to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different.The relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.|1
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode.|1
I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case.|1
This movie is certainly well-constructed , beginning and ending in the dark , with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt , who is still alive and a woman , not a girl , and then the main focus on the children of Schmidt , who were all killed, with a focus on their children , some of them still in their teens . It is indeed a haunting story but it has a great ending . I think that I have seen it a few times since it has come out , I have always enjoyed it , and this time I really liked it .|0
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison, is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English. Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long long time ( and I 've seen a LOT of them, actually ), and it seems like this one is going to end up not being the end of the world, I can 't help but think this was the result of a 're-boot' of a movie I loved. I mean, you don't have to go too deep into the story to realize that, but in a way it is still a good story, and a better story than 'Sideways' I guess.|0
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one . The writing was awful , the acting was awful , all the dialogue was poor . There are only a handful of scenes where I actually care about the character . The best part of this film was the ending, I just wish they hadn’t killed all the actors. The rest of the film was a mess . This review does not necessarily reflect the opinions or beliefs of Cinema Blend or the owners of this review site. The film was well acted , well directed , and well scripted , but I just did not like the story and characters .|0
I recently rented this promising mini series, I didn't even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.Forsyth deserves much, much better than this.|1
"I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career , but `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, or: The Emperor's New Clothes '' is not one of my favourites, despite some brilliant scenes of slapstick humor. It was never meant to be. I think because I grew up in the 1970s and saw my own parents in a much happier time. My mum and dad didn't have much to say to each other, apart from the occasional ""I love you, Mum!"" at Christmas and birthdays, or ""Honey, what's for supper?"""|0
Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. Upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better film than,The 6th Sense(8.2), Saving Private Ryan(8.4), Lord of the Rings( 8.7),Godfather(9.5), Gladiator(8.1) and Dawn of the Dead ( 7.8) to name a few.|1
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes.|1
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.He wrote this, I swear.With Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and makes it in to a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay.|1
I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back . It was so bad , I can only imagine the things the makers were thinking when they wrote this script . This is definitely one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . I know there are not a great many horror movies out there that I like , but this film is just bad , and that is saying a lot because the makers of the film were so bad , it is hard to think this could be any worse . The film is also one of the most unoriginal horror movies ever made .|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There wasn't any of that here. When Greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged.|1
"This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people , two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah blah... The plot is actually about the life of one of the protagonists. I think it would be more effective to have all three characters played by the same actor
but I can't figure out who to go for, so I would have to make a judgement call. If I were to make this film I would play one
of the kids as either a child or grown up

This is the second time I have reviewed a film by this author."|0
"Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). ""Liz"" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party."|1
"Found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown,(Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. In one scene as Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed),""Dead Sexy"",01."|1
"Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes , directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins ' . Derek Washington stars in "" Vampain "" on Lifetime . With over 300 million in global box office sales ""Vampire Assassins "" will have a global impact and resonate with audiences around the globe. I am grateful for the opportunity to make this movie . I'm also grateful to everyone who worked hard on the movie including the producers , director and crew. I appreciate everyone's efforts and wish them all the very best as they move forward . Derek Washington has always taken a positive and caring approach to all of his endeavors ."|0
This is one of my 3 favorite movies . I 've been out on the water since I was 13 and my family and me are still out on the water and fishing the same spots. I just love the music and scenery and it makes it a really good vacation. I think it might have to be one of my favorites. We have been on the water in the area a few times, including a few trips with friends to see the boat show in town. We go to the local campground every year, and it's really nice.|0
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I do so out of a desire to enlighten. However, when I do so, I see it as nothing more than a tactic used by religious fanatics to deceive a public who do not want to be deceived. To prove my point, I will share with you a recent article by the self proclaimed ‘science’ writer in this very blog who states that God created the earth and all life and that He created the sun, moon, stars and all that is in them.|0
"First of all, i have nothing against Christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. I don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this ""movie"", because I couldn't find any of those in this. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some sake has abandoned religion."|1
( Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important you could n't have figured out yourselves ) Yeah , it's kinda cool to know you could actually do things that are more important that the game does not seem to allow. You know , do things for real , not just do things in the game . It gives it more purpose and I think that it is more enjoyable and entertaining. It makes it fun. Well it's not just me , most people seem to feel the same way I do. I love that we can make the game fun for the player.|0
I suppose I 'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt . These laboratory movies (or whatever they're called now) are so much more expensive to make than a movie like that made in a big studio. And they don't always turn out as well as they should. The only way you'll see a better quality version is if it's on the big screen where they can have bigger mirrors. I know for a fact they can be pretty good at this kind of thing in a few years.|0
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood . Its hard to believe that this was the second time i was picked for worst film, the last time was a movie called “Swingers”, which was actually okay. This movie has no redeeming value, the best thing is that even after it came out, the movie didn’t do too well. This time, i don’t feel bad at all, because i really think the movie was a joke and i hope that in future movies, i will at least not take the same decision again.|0
This was not a good movie ! ! Why do you people keep saying that ? There is a nice part in the movie , if you take a close look at it you can see it. If you say a lot of things that I don´t know, it´s not a good movie ! Why do you keep saying that ? I am not so sure that the movie is very good ! ! I am not so sure about it but it is a nice part ! ! It´s a movie for fans and people who like movies and they like movies with a nice plot.|0
"This is a must-see movie . You will laugh , you will cry , and when it 's over you will think back to this day and all those things you learned while watching this film . It's a great film . I'm giving it a 9.5 , and it will get a 9.5 when I watch the movie . J.K. Simmons

I agree, it's a great film . I've seen it about a million times . I liked the movie . I loved the book . I thought it was an amazing film . I think I loved it as much as any book I've read ."|0
This movie is so bad , they would n't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store . I had already bought the movie back when they first came out on VHS so I knew I would get it again . Now I cant find the movie . I have read some reviews and a few of the comments on the internet . It does look bad . I know there is a DVD copy , but there is no DVD of the movie at all . I know there may be an alternate version of this movie or it may have been used , but there is none .|0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn't as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession.|1
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM. I'll explain why.1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film'.|1
I 'm an action movie fan but until today I 've never seen a preview or an ad for this film. But I'm very happy to see that in the future this is going to happen. Here is a trailer for the film I am looking forward to. I really hope that the story will go like it should and I wish I could find a way to get a sneak peak to the trailer. But this is my only hope in finding a trailer for the sequel. But if that's the case then I will be happy to see the next movie in the series.|0
I think Trash really sucks . I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I have n't seen that many episodes, and it was just a lot of mindless garbage . I really hope that I am wrong, but it seems very unlikely that it won't ever be cancelled, as it seems that they're getting pretty good at it. It's probably best if it gets cancelled because it is going to be hard for the show to be renewed, I think. This show is the only show I have ever seen that has so much of a personality.|0
As a big Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly came alive and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri.|1
"If you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy ""You Are Alone"". It is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness."|1
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order.|1
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. He's got LOSER written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from ""getting the girl."" Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car. Well, his new job is racing still, as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes. There's nothing really to endear you to Rod, even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid."|1
"Kazuo Komizu strikes again with ""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman"", the sequel to ""Entrails of a Virgin"". This time around the story is based around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take on the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped-up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day. When she gets over her head and the Yakuza capture her, she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery. It apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine."|1
"I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of African musical - since people break into song every few minutes.None of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a ""tune. ""Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling."|1
"the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who 's a real bastard and he wants to launch his super-yacht on a space mission where they use their rocket to explore the space. This film is a space opera, a film about a space mission, and I love the characters. The cast includes:

Bong Joon-Ho as the pilot and the main character in this movie and also the villain. He's not just the villain, but also one of the crew members, so I think he is good. He is very handsome and I like his character."|0
As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra BS that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. Well...this was that piece of crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. The only half-witted acting came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies.|1
Reba is a very dumb show . You can predict pretty much anything that 's about to happen . Barbra Streisand will come to be in your life at some point and then she will die . That will happen. That is just how it happens. And then, you have to go through a period of mourning . You cannot do anything to change it but you are forced to make decisions . What to do? Who to go out with . You have to figure that out. So, you have to make choices . And then, when you have made your choices you are stuck with them.|0
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermellons, people, etc. This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to.The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV.What is Phase IV?|1
I saw the movie on its North American premiere ( July 14 , 2004 ) at the Fantasia Festival . . . and I was amazed at the quality of the acting . . . the cast was outstanding . . . I didn't notice much of the plot but I have to say I didn't dislike it . . . and I didn't think it was as good as the original film. In fact , the movie was better than the original. The story is a great story and the plot, as I see it, is simple . . .|0
"Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - ""eXistenZ"" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (""P.R. nerd"") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth."|1
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together.|1
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. Just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses.|1
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who's usually an amazing actor, was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt was given nothing to work with here.|1
Crispin Glovers ' way of acting ( and not only his ) is tremendous . You really want to believe what you see , and then , after a bit more than an hour, it's confirmed. Crispin is an absolute delight to see and he's one of those players that you can tell you have a great knowledge of the game before you watch the match. He's an absolute class act and I hope he's in the England squad this summer. The only other thing is that it didn't seem like anyone had actually been on their feet for the first hour, which was very annoying.|0
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980 's , this based-on-fact movie tells the story of an army sergeant who was in a helicopter accident and ends up on a boat on Lake Michigan, only to be picked up by the FBI and thrown back in jail. The plot was not that hard to understand , and it all happened in 1984, and this is not the kind of movie where you want to watch it again unless you're in the military or something. The story was good, and very believable, but that's where the problems end.|0
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs ( Naked Gun 1 , 2 & 3 ) that made it to the silver screen. It was not until the late 1980’s that the popularity of the short-lived series ‘Mavericks’ saw it gain traction among the adult-entertainment and horror-movie audiences who would come back time after time to see action-horror. However, the success of the ‘Mavericks’ was not enough to keep it going, and even after the release of its third installment ( the film version ) in 1989, it never found a new home.|0
This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.The basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls.|1
To paraphrase the previous reviewer 's comments , if you 're a Stooges fan , avoid this one at all costs. You 're just going to come off as an immature kid, and if your friends don't like it, then that 's a plus for me. If you 'd like more of a Stooges fan base, maybe pick it up when the film is released, but it 's not worth it. I did read the book and I really liked the movie and all the characters but it doesn't hold up at all.|0
"I still count ""Police Squad!"" as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that ""Police Squad!"" was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like ""You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan."|1
"Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. Absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help cringe when I recall some of his lines, like ""In or out? You're worse than a cat!"""|1
I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of dancing was annoying. It was great to see a bit of action on a Saturday Night Live type program and to have a show to talk about when not doing that. On a side note the show was funny, as well as making me glad I've found a new TV station in Nashville that is going to be a place where comedy is king and a place I can go and watch it. I've missed it. You know what?|0
Got to confess right up front that I didn't watch this entire movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers sum this one up nicely. It was badly conceived. Badly scripted. Badly acted.But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. And hang. And hang.|1
I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as I found the story here a bit disjointed as I was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. Still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.|1
"The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics. While the theme seems common, what ""makes"" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. Ditto for the music.The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. A very canny strategy by the writer/director."|1
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good !!! Thought it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying. This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out scenes of course, to keep any horror buff like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good IMO. Even though its not a high budget movie, the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes. Worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure!|1
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it got into the Panorama section, but still. This film featured:1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video.The one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby: homosexuality. That's right, about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off.|1
Okay , enough . Every time I think I 've seen a film that is so misbegotten , so bad , so ridiculous, that I have to post it on my page , I always find something else to add . So I 've been doing some research on the film ( I know I shouldn 't be doing that , but that 's part of it ) and I found a lot of interesting information on the movie . 1. The first scene that came to my mind was the first scene . It seems that the first scene is always the same , even for a film that I 'm trying to see .|0
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other heist film has come close to it, before or after. The plot is simple, but engrosses you. It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. You care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. It's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois.|1
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect , but Rififi definitely fits the bill . No matter what you are looking for, in terms of style and storytelling, the movie has it. If I have to describe the plot, Rififi has an extremely simple one. A young woman goes to an island in order to marry a rich guy. There is not much information about the island, but the couple has a beautiful daughter. But the daughter is not happy with the way her dad is going.|0
Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh ( Min-Sik Choi ) is bailed out of jail by Oh-Seong ( Kim Ye-Seok ) with the aid of his friend Yoo-Eun ( Park Ji-Hye ). When his friends are in danger of losing all their money he runs away, only to meet a group of other Dae-su Ohs who were also run out of town when they were drunk. In the second part of the series, Oh is released from jail, and he goes to his home town to search for his friends.|0
Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call `` humor '' . That this movie was made in such a disgusting way shows that the artist was not serious. This is the kind of material we can expect from Moore, this type of trash. To me, it will be even more interesting to see the true artistic merit of this movie when he is not the same person that makes it out of the garbage he is now. I am surprised that Moore still has any life. I don't know how much time Moore has left.|0
"I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. Had it been labelled an ""artsy film"" I wouldn't have purchased the DVD; now I have a DVD that I'll never watch again and who would buy it?"|1
The most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful, cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could've saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is, they're better actors than this movie would have you believe.|1
"I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. As I lived this situation and get lost in it, I hope a similar story would inspire me. My major concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) the triangle forms ? - Why (c) & How (d) the triangle degenerates ? (a) The movie offers a plain answer: ""because it's better !"". (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together."|1
It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion.|1
"This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other ""professional"" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie."|1
In 1895 , in a small village in Japan , the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo ( Takahiro Tamura ) dies, after taking too much poison, while trying to clean up her house. Her husband then dies of the effects of the poison, after taking too little poison himself. The wife is then left with her two little children to raise without any help from her husband. Two years later , she meets the owner of a restaurant, named Takashi Sakai ( Tomonori Ushiyama ), and his wife Shizue ( Yoko Kato ).|0
Eleven years ago , Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding out who his enemy was inside himself. Ipkiss’s name and the story of his life are a great example for anyone to emulate, and those of us who have followed his path have learned how to harness the power of that inner hero and do our best to be as good as or better than him. Since Ipkiss’s true inner hero is found in each of us, the question is how to get to know that hero.|0
"The sort of ""little"" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. Sort of a ""soul"" version of the more well-known ""The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells"". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas."|1
There is no reason to watch this film.Why ? Many reasons . First up , the acting is awful . Not good at all , not good , not great . I dont know what to say . But the plot , that is the part that is supposed to make the viewer laugh , makes me really hate it . But I will give this film a go . The second reason , which I already explained in my review , is the director , who is terrible . I dont know why , but I just don't like this person.|0
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The oldest son has just comeback from Vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie.|1
Firstly , let me make it clear that I love aircraft , and usually any film with them in is great , this is one of the few films I've been looking forward to watching ever since the announcement of it . In this film we go to South Korea , which has a long-held reputation of producing some of the most beautiful landscapes, and some of the most beautiful people , ever. For my money this is the best documentary on Korea I've seen since I was a little boy , and we even get a couple of clips from this film at the end.|0
A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast. Not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. Just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. Not one of director Roger Corman's best.|1
"I ca n't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic . I 'm a million miles from reality, yet it's the first book I have read that I can honestly call a ""work of real world"" and I 'll never look at anything like this the same again. It's hard enough to read fiction with no outside perspective, but I find it hard to believe that a story can be so much more than it seems. This is a great book, and one of the books I've been reading lately."|0
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.The first one, which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic.|1
"Why could n't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery 's men fighting the French instead of the Nazis??!!??? ""It is one thing to be in charge of something, it's another thing to be in control of it. It is very strange to find that somebody else, somebody without power, somebody who has no voice, has no influence, no power, has no voice in the way you feel about the place. And so you are left, and you have to say, 'Where did I go wrong?'"|0
Okay , I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the old house, my mom and I were sitting and talking about what we would do with some of the toys that we had gotten. She said that we are going to look at a couple toys that I would have bought myself a year ago that we can use. And when I said yes, I didn’t really believe that she was going to say no. I have always been in love with cars, motorcycles, toy cars.|0
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play.|1
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB , as in Bottom of the Barrel . I ca n't figure out what the point is of the headline . I could see why someone might not be able to take it literally , but I don't see the point in having an article with a bomb on it. And I'll go ahead and say here , that you have no right at all to use a word that you know to be incorrect , but I'll also take a moment to give you one last thing.|0
"This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around.His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his ""Penguin"" days from Batman."|1
the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), characters names change (Claire or Sara?). It is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. If it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG.|1
I love old `` monster movies '' for the pure camp value . This one does not disappoint if you are looking for a `` monster movie for your collection of classic monsters . In fact , this movie will take you to a place you might not expect and you won`t want to take your family out for the evening . The film opens up with some scenes where we have been introduced to a new `` monster . As we have seen from the previous film , the monster is not what you would call friendly . This new monster , the monster of the night , is different from the other monsters .|0
This is the Australian TV series. It is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and song just fantastic. The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that.|1
San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother?|1
"Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in ""Demons"" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by ""The Smiths"" and ""The Cult"", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing."|1
"I can't say if ""The Cavern"" is a ripoff of ""The Cave"" because I haven't seen that. I've seen ""The Descent"" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. Hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. There are times when I guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting?"|1
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer . They were even higher when i saw the movie had the first official trailer. I know it isnt really a spoiler to say but i didnt even get to see it. I was so worried that this movie was gonna be way too dark and i dont even know how it would compare to Twilight but i guess i will just wait for the final trailer to see. This movie is so different from every other movie that is out, i love it. So i just wanted to say thank you everyone who has a chance to go see it.|0
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel ? The acting is bad and the story has no relevance to anything. For the most part I gave them all up after about 5 minutes because the plot got old after a while and there just isn't a very good story to it at this point. This is the movie where the only good thing I saw in the whole thing is a car crash scene. I gave this film 5/10 and it's just because the acting isn't really up to par with everything else.|0
This was a great film in every sense of the word . It tackles the subject of tribadism in a way which makes the viewer want to know more about it. It gives the viewer an insight into the life of Javed Sultan, and what kind of person he really is in his own words and in the way he carries on his business. It is an inspiring film, and anyone can relate to the plight of the poor who have no voice in the government. This film tells us all about Javed and his way of life.|0
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.)|1
This is n't a bad TV movie . Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion , which means Penal Batallion . This movie had a good production . One good thing about this movie is they did not give any stars . This is good enough for us . The story of the movie is nothing . It had some bad acting . There is no good actor in it . A lot of people were in this movie . But this was a bad movie and it was not a movie to watch if you want good TV . I will not watch this movie and not watch any of the other good TV movies .|0
Bad . Bad . Bad . Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot fans. The plot is the same as every other “Crazy Stupid Love” picture and just as silly and predictable as the last. If you liked “I Feel Pretty” it’s bad, if you liked “Crazy Stupid Love”, well, then you’ll be happy with just the first three. I’m not saying this is bad, it’s just bad. But “Bad Boys” does have moments of brilliance.|0
So, you wanna be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or you're REALLY into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes.|1
Goldrush : A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages . The movie focuses around the experience of a small town in the mid-sixties Alaska in which time is running out and all but the most hardened of Alaskans (like myself) must face the inevitable. The movie follows the events which led to the closing of the town’s only road in 1968. The movie takes place in a few short days in 1963. We follow the journey of one person’s search for a new start in a place with only a few people who would be able to take them.|0
This is one of those movies where the acting , set location , direction , and effects were so bad , that it makes me wonder if I'm watching this movie or a movie about an idiot . there was nothing good about it, the acting, direction, production design , and even the script was awful , it was like seeing a bad film by a crappy director and not getting anything good at all . that's exactly what happens here , everything was bad , but that's what makes it so depressing .|0
... not to waste your time watching this vanity project . I 've had my comment deleted twice now , for wasting time . I am just an amateur . I'm not even sure I know what this is or why I am doing it . I just thought I had to post it because it was nice to look at . I have nothing against women . Just women who know how to look nice and smart and have no bad taste . I would love to see someone do this ! I'm not a pro in the art world but I'm pretty sure I know a little bit .|0
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent.|1
I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like I did).|1
"""The Journey"" is a romantic version of the cold war. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956. She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.Of course, the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip."|1
"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this?"|1
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between the protagonist, and the movie. I have been looking for horror films like this since I got into horror movies as a child. I have to admit that the story is a little scary, and not in a good way. I have to say that this film has the potential for being one of my favorites. I am looking forward to reading the sequel! I really liked the way you described it. I agree, this is not for everyone.|0
Let's get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards.|1
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. It's just that there is nothing of interest in this film. There are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle.|1
If you put Seinfeld aside , this is The Best Comedy ever , no doubt ! Just Great ! `` The episode title is the best way to say what this show is about - It's a love story, in a sense - It's the tale of two lovers, and they both find themselves falling in love with the wrong person - The wrong one. The story is well written and the performances are top notch , from Jerry and Jerry in particular , who do a great job in their respective roles as Jerry and George , and they are not just standup , but also very funny .|0
The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? Let's consider this movie as 'A History Of Violence' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now.|1
Overall, a well done movie. There were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at, but I came away with something more than I gone in with.I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana, is way beyond what this movie stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India. The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family.|1
"A moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan, and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" Really. A specialist in ""Oriental history"" who doesn't speak any Japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? Please. This looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary."|1
I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest.|1
It is sad that some find this film worth watching . I am Russian , and I am disgusted . This is not a film . This film is propaganda for the US. I believe that this film should be banned , the US and Russia should know how to live peacefully ,and not interfere in other countries' domestic affairs. I am sorry to those who are offended that it is offensive to Russian. It is not offensive to the people in the United States, Russian, or the European Union. It is offensive to the Russian government .|0
This is a film by Oshima , the director of the notorious `` In The Realm Of The Senses '' which won the Academy award for best film of 1968. Oshima's film is a re-edited version of the original script that was originally shot in 1968. Oshima is the first major Japanese director to work on a film in America, and he also produced and starred in the film. The film has been a critical and popular success and is recognized as one of Oshima's best known works. The film is the subject of a feature on the Oshima Museum that was edited into the film.|0
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will 's `` genius '' is concerned . Not just in math -- even in science. Not just in chemistry -- even in biology -- but in physics as well . But why . Why such astounding suspension of disbelief ? Why does the scientific community accept such nonsense as fact ? It seems to be in a very large number of people's minds that they can ""not believe"" that gravity can affect the movement of the earth . The problem is this. Gravity ... gravity pulls things in such a way that some of them cannot move and some of them ."|0
"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve."|1

Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank holdup. After arriving at a remote bank, he takes in the sights of the bank and is taken in by a team of robbers led by the boss. The movie begins in the same way as its predecessor. We find out that the movie starts with a bank robbery but that we get no context for why or when it was set up. We get only that it was set. We don’t know why it is set.|0
i love this show . i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the next season . it’s a really good show and it feels like a really good place to live . i just really like it. i am a very big fan. I’m a bit late to the show, but I’ve been watching for three seasons now. With the exception of Season 1, which I had watched once, I’ve watched Season 2 at least five times, and I’m enjoying it so far.|0
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow workers; he becomes the target of gangsters, and is kidnapped and brutally tortured before his life is cut short by a sniper's bullet; later, he wakes up alone in a hospital bed and discovers his wife has died. A young man wakes up to discover his wife is no more; that he is alone and his son is dead; and that he is a murderer, who kills people on the way to his next victim.|0
"I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's ""contestants"" are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune.For anyone to appear on National TV and blubber, sniffle, and whine about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, aren't our responsibility?"|1
Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie ! It takes a long-winded bore to describe how to do it on the computer and I'm sure a lot of people will want to read more about it for the sake of understanding it. I don't think a lot of comments are going to be made that are going to make a difference to how it all works. I am not going to give an in depth breakdown of it because it is too long and complicated to go over in a couple paragraphs.|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien 's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know about his style and his vision, and it is, in fact, quite difficult, and I can’t imagine that anyone would try to do that. The film is a sort of homage to Bresson. Sebastien's style is very modern, but he never tries to impose anything artificial upon it. He is always able to take Bresson's ideas, but he doesn’t force them on the viewer. In Sebastien’s film it's easy to see all of this.|0
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name.|1
Ben Marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.The job Ben applies is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house.|1
"Being a fan of the series I thought , how bad can the movie be ? Well I got my answer when I saw this news : “Star Wars” will be remade . This news comes to us from an interview given to “Star Wars Insider” by John Knott who was asked the question “How does it feel to watch the new ‘A New Hope?”

As I said in the post, I was skeptical about the whole new “Return of the Jedi” story and I have been looking for an official statement from the studio for a long while now."|0
I was looking forward to Dante 's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime , but this was disappointing. I mean really? There are other great writers to choose from in the anthology but Dante's name isn't even listed anywhere. It's like the producers decided not to read my reviews on their website. I think the showrunners are going to regret this decision because I'm definitely going to write about the show again. I'll never understand the production crew's aversion to paying attention to my opinions. This is the best horror anthology in the history of the genre.|0
This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself `` this is not going to work.'' But it does and here it is. But I'm sure you understand why it didn't. I'm just so excited for the future of this series to unfold. And I don't just mean that the plot itself is moving along. I mean it has been building to a climax since the very beginning of the first episode and I'm so proud that it finally came together. If you haven't already seen it I strongly suggest you do.|0
All right, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. That's the first thing that's wrong with RL, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission?|1
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $ 5.00 . But since it featured a live show it wasn't too hard to find. I ordered it today because I was bored and it was on sale. The DVD had a lot of extra material, including a bonus disk of the live show. I was disappointed because I know how much it sucks when there is no live show. But, after I saw that bonus disk, I was glad that it was available at a reduced price.|0
Night hunter is a sold B style action movie . Get a life and grow up people . Don ``t ever come back to this stupid place . You never wanted to go through what you went through . You have no idea why I had to come and find you here . No one else could help me . No one else could do what you were capable of doing . I didn't even have the guts to come to you . I am sorry about that . Don ``t even think that I didn't think I had the guts to come and find you .|0
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral.|1
"The `` silver screen '' gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life 's rainbows ''

In the late '30s and early '40s, the country was enjoying its golden years. There was no shortage of fine entertainment, and it was easy to catch up on the films that were available on VHS, a medium that still continues today. A new release was on the way, a movie called A Star is Born, the story of an actress who returns to Los Angeles and falls in love with a handsome young actor (Richard Thomas), who becomes a part of her family and her dreams."|0
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid . This is clearly not ""The Best of "" (at least if we are talking about film) It is not the type of movie i would expect to be on the best of of list. In fact, this is the worst film i have seen in ages - from a director, who is the worst person i know - it's the worst film i've ever seen that is not based on a book. I've seen it many times and never had any problem."|0
"This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All of it, sucked. Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog, such as ""how ya doing?""..."|1
This is my first `` awful '' rating ever on IMDb and I could n't think of a more deserving person to get it. It's a true story, as the title implies, from a very young age, when she was a girl. The fact that you don't know who the child's mother is has no bearing on the story at all: it is about a child whose mother left her when she was an infant. That the child is still a child when she meets the mother is just an accident of time and location.|0
Not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them.|1
Killer Flood : The Day the Damn Broke : 1/10 : Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof . It’s the movie you know and love that just doesn’t work. If it did, the movie would be a blockbuster. But in spite of all this, The Day the Damn Broke remains a forgettable entry in the horror genre . It’s a shame too, because with this film I am very proud to be able to be a part of a cult movie. It will be an honor to be able to share the experience of the film and the people behind this horror flick.|0
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park...or if they have it was not very well. None of the characters are what they should be: Fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris' personality. Additionally, a first person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be.|1
"This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old ""cons turn good"" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', although nowhere near as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is Ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in Terminator 4.The MOD Squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy."|1
Like the previous two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film.|1
this is one of the stupidest movies ever , not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest . the way i understand it is , the main characters are going to die but they get their chance at life . this is the part where the movie becomes so stupid that you forget all your intelligence and just laugh . this is why i say that this is the stupidest movie , it's the stupidity of the movie which makes it so . as i say , there is nothing clever about this movie , there is just stupid , and that's all .|0
"Not having any idea what this film was about , but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in several scenes, it was most likely meant to be about a guy named 'Leguizamo'. Anyway, here's an extract from the description in Wikipedia :

""During the 1970s and early ‘80s, David Cronenberg began to cast himself in various roles in order to make a career. He began by appearing in low-budget productions of films he had written and co-starring in with other “horrorscenarian” actors. Soon after his breakthrough, he was cast in the long-running television series The Exorcist."|0
"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. This movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. Steve's rendition of a dying cat during his ""I love what I know"" serenade had me vomiting for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying. ""You messin' wit private stock."""|1
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 ( may be overall too ) if it had been a good film . . . and it was . . . a terrible film . . . so what? I think a lot of people should watch it . . . and it would be nice to see something that might have done better than its box-office numbers. The Last Picture Show was not the last thing I would have wanted to be, but I certainly didn't expect that it would be the best. In fact, I thought it was pretty awful.|0
Historically awful. Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. Events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. Likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics.|1
I expected a lot more out of this film . The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. But the thing that amazed me the most is how bad this film really is. What I mean by bad is that the acting was mediocre. And I didn't just mean that they did nothing right, but they also had nothing to do with the story. I watched it again, and I think I know what you are referring to when you said the story is boring . That's not really true.|0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon.|1
"Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed ""victim"" messing the whole set until she finally ""die"". Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina."|1
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film isn't anywhere near as funny.|1
Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars.|1
Dante would of been mortified , if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !! Now I don’t want to go to the length of telling you how good this is but you need to listen to it. It is one of the best poems I have heard in my life! It is amazing!! It has a very simple message. I will be doing more of these as I continue to be involved. Dante was born in Florence in 1304.|0
ExCUSE me, but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o' poop. As the evil sister with hair that Mommy Dearest would envy, I did my very best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. I'm sad that this did not come across... Ah well, a friend compared it to a 'rock bottom budget SHOWGIRLS' with a white hot spoon.' I'll have to be content with that. What amazes me is no one mentioned the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt contest. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history.|1
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. Luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. A hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house.|1
For anyone who has ever sought happiness , `` Half Empty '' is a must-see . This original cross- cultural drama is about a couple of characters from two completely different worlds, and the way that they come together . I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing, as it was so long in length . The acting is great , and the dialogue was a little on the heavy side , but the story is so well told , it was really worth watching . This is a story that you would want to read and re watch again and again .|0
This movie was terrible. You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain films combined. To start, the acting was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.|1
Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill's life upside down.|1
Uggh ! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s ! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by that company ! How dare they make us listen to them over the radio ?! And I still have to listen to them on the radio for years on end, while they were still on air ! It has been almost a century since we last saw Hanna-Barbera. I haven't seen any other Hanna-Barbera cartoons since the 80s, when Hanna-Barbera was on its way out (as I recall) - and they were pretty awful. The 60s and 70s are pretty good.|0
I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.Grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. I am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.It ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.|1
What a cast ... and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , Chris Pratt , John Leguizamo , Steve Carell ... you know that it's a movie worth checking out , not one that takes itself seriously and just tries to be funny at the same time . It's a funny movie that just gets better as the night goes on . This movie is definitely worth seeing . Suffice to say , I won't be seeing this movie at the theater , but I will most likely watch this on Netflix for sure .|0
Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers ' ( 1968 ) said `` Do n't call me Dad'' and has become an institution to many. Even today, there is an entire generation of children who think that being a pro-basketball or soccer fan is cool enough. It is the same with movies. We all go through life with a certain level of self-regard, but we never get used to it. If we were to see movies that were really good we wouldn't think it was cool to see them.|0
"Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and ""gritty downtown"" from a suburban perspective.The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola$, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men At Work, The Flirts and Bananarama.This movie truly is Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's Los Angeles."|1
This film was utterly horrible . Stupid premise , and horrible acting by all . Whoever wrote this trash should have known better . I remember watching this when I was a teenager . It's not something you'll ever forget . And yet it's still a classic film . This is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I've seen a few others and have to agree with the others here, it is a film that doesn't belong in the theater. To make it even worse, the film itself is terrible. I can't even explain why it's terrible.|0
Get the CD instead. The show is tame, and the editing sucks. The crowd gets way too much screen time, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape it's recorded on.|1
"Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like ""Arrested Development"" and yet they keep this show and ""War at Home"". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy ""Married with Children"", but now it's just getting ridiculous. ""The Loop"" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpons"" work because there is a constant flow of jokes."|1
As a fan of C.J . 's earlier movie , Latter Days , I really wanted to like this film.The movie wasn't great. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't great. I didn't enjoy it because of the pacing. I felt like it was dragging a little too much. The characters were bland, and I felt like I wasn't seeing much development, especially because of the pacing. I would have preferred that it didn't move like that at all, it could have been much more dynamic, as it was back in 2009.|0
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so I thought I would take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years.Better than I expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighting men and women.|1
I found the Movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the film the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful He was real at his character. The ending took a wonderful twist. I would recommend you seeing it. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol.|1
"When HULK hit theaters in 2003 , it was n't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show were out, and a new animated movie was announced for 2005: The Incredible Hulk Movie. For those of you who never saw or heard of The Incredible Hulk Movie before seeing the DVD box set, I thought it was great. For those not familiar with the Hulk, here's what Wikipedia has to say about The Incredible Hulk Movie: The Incredible Hulk Movie is the fourth movie of the ""Hulk-verse"" which consists of the TV series The Incredible Hulk (1999–2003) as well as its film adaptation."|0
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special. The acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.However, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles.|1
Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf, and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.This film has so many good things I can't even say them.|1
"Sorry about the ""extremely clever"" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help myself.I've been meaning to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten."|1
As a rule , I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them . However , I've noticed over the last few months that I'm starting to discover a lot of new things to enjoy from movies , and not in the least because I've discovered some very interesting things from a couple of films that I've not previously seen, and that I've enjoyed ! When it comes to films , I really enjoy going to my local cinema , especially when I can get the chance to meet a few fellow movie fans .|0
"Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who 's idea this was and what soup they're making out of it. It all sounds very strange, but this one actually makes you feel like you are really there. A few minutes into the flick and you find yourself in a hotel room, sitting on one of the sofas. A few minutes later, there's someone in a wheelchair who has just arrived in a wheelchair. The whole thing just kind of goes from ""What is going on"" to ""What is this film about."""|0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again.|1
"It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "" Bigger and better "" but I'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - Rumours . But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004 Channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston . Yes that Christopher Eccleston an actor I've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true ."|1
"""My Blue Heaven"" is boring. The plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. The leads, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.There's really only one reason to watch ""My Blue Heaven""."|1
Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable.It left me yearning for a real film. :)The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes, which dissipates any discernible tension.And the character relationship 'twists'? Yeah, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline.|1
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. Park's newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes, that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean, and uniquely Park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop.|1
Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie.|1
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason, we can’t have any actual news, can we?! That was the gist of a comment made during a recent segment on MSNBC in response to the ongoing controversy surrounding President Barack Obama’s healthcare plan. When the segment began, host Ed Schultz was talking about the recent news reports about the Obama administration being reluctant to release the text of his healthcare plan, which some claim has led to confusion among voters.|0
This film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but I am not sure what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. There are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie.|1
There were nice characters in here , played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses , plus it had a famous band in it! Well, you can't deny that. I have never watched the movies in the theater , so this is my first time in a theater as well. But still I liked this movie. There were very nice characters in it, and the band was nice too! The movie was a good time-killer. It had a lot of humor in it as well. It was quite an interesting movie. You will not regret seeing it. And you will like it.|0
In America, the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. A few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find Augustine, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of Jonathan's family.|1
* * * SLIGHT SPOILERS * * * This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit as the heroes are taken captive by a mysterious force that is trying to take over the earth. As the story unfolds, it seems that more questions are being asked than answers. We have a new villain in this issue. If you missed this arc, don't worry, there is some new info here and there and we'll be posting a bunch of new news and stories about it later. But I can't wait any longer! The art is really, really good!|0
I watched this movie the other night , and I have to admit , it was quite possibly the best film that I have seen in a long while, in a weird way I actually like the film as much as I dislike the book . there are several reasons why that is so , but one of which i can think off is because the author of the film has done an incredible job making the movie as well . my favorite part of the film , and the reason why the book was not that great , is the way it shows the story .|0
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.|1
'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. Alas, as I watched it alone, and so I felt like I almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'Thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries.|1
"This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps? ), attacking model trains and toy cars. The ""science"" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? And what's up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from ""some god-forsaken anti-matter universe"", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in New York."|1
What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs.|1
In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost.|1
I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease.|1
"This movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It looked like they made no effort to make the ""future"" look in the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). Additionally, its pretty obvious that Don ""the Dragon"" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film)."|1
"For me, this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles based ""Z"" Channel when it was in service. And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one I did not want to accept.Moving to Los Angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the ""Z"" Channel in its showing of international films."|1
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true."|1
I have watched two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I am no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful college life. I wish that I spent a little more time socializing. I kind of identify myself with rusty. When I was rushing a fraternity, my big brother was not like Cappie at all, I wish that I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters, then it is a pretty good show.It is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes.|1
"Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? There is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that I found this ""movie"" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and POORLY ACTED. I admire them for the try, but the ""actors"" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I did not have that option, so it gets a 1."|1
This movie was really funny . The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy , should get a little surprise . It was one of my favorite films of 2014 . The movie is based on a book written by , which has been translated in many foreign languages and languages like Hindi , Urdu , Bengali . The original book was published by , and was released in 2002 . The story is based on a murder , a murder that is taking place in London and a murder that is going on in Delhi . The movie deals with the murder in Delhi , and some characters are from different parts of Delhi .|0
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's first shot at mainstream acceptance . In a turbulent career spanning nearly 60 years, Fassbinder worked tirelessly to become the leading artist of his time . Fassbinder came to international prominence as a sculptor and installation artist, and then in the 1980s, as a painter . He has had numerous exhibitions both nationally and internationally, many of his most popular works appearing in major galleries, museums and in private collections. Although many of his works have received mixed reviews , Fassbinder's sculptures of the past 30 years have garnered a great deal of critical attention .|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. I wasted enough time myself watching it, so I will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. The Cavern is one of those.|1
"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as ""the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times"" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is in there too."|1
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film. Trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.There were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and Kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. This just looked like filler.Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and seeing an IBM techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it.|1
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong, wait and see.|1
The only reason I did n't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable . The storyline wasnt very interesting. I felt there wasnt enough plot and I couldnt understand why these characters was fighting each other. I felt like there was a lack of action, its kinda like watching a cartoon, with nothing going on and nothing moving. The acting was okay, but not exceptional. My only complain is the beginning, the scenes where the characters is on the island, is boring and I felt there were more interesting scenes. And the ending was too long.|0
I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The dialog is cheesy. Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he's supposed to be from.|1
"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story."|1
"What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting, believable plot lines, or anything resembling a quality movie.This is pure blaxploitation at it's finest. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialog, objectification of women, and the sleaziest cops you can imagine.This vanity piece by the ""Godfather of Rap,"" Rudy Ray Moore, who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured.You not only see blaxploitation at it's finest, but get glimpses of his comedy genius, and see why his records were kept under the counter."|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. It was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. Running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), No close-ups!!|1
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot.|1
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I 've seen in the US. The story is based on the life of Bhagavan.I have never heard of this film before. The main attraction of the film has been the story of Bhagavan and the events that he goes through. It was a great movie to see him grow up. The main story is interesting too but it seems that some scenes were made more dramatic than they needed to be, and some of the fights had to be made a bit stronger.|0
"Who said it had to be believable ? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down and listen to this, just in case it's true, which it very well may well not be

I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski . He is Polish , I am French . We look at the same world , the same people and the same questions. We are all looking for answers , the same is true for every person . We are looking for truth and answers to some of our questions. I read somewhere once that if you ask the question , Kieslowski will look at you like a dog and he will tell you to go to hell . And you can be sure he knows exactly what he means .|0
Oh how awfully this movie is ! I do n't know if it is a horror film or a drama film or a romance movie or a science fiction film... but it is not any film genre that is not my favorite! I do n't like all horror, thriller or action movies ... but I like this movie all the way ! It is a movie I would recommend all horror lovers watch ! I loved it all the way!!! I am sure you all know how much I love the movie ! I didn't like it much ...|0
Oh boy . Films like this really bother me . If this movie is supposed to close to truth , this is one of the most twisted . This film is made up of two parts : First half is about the real world . This is about the story about a real life events . The other part of the movie is a fictional movie . This is the part about the fictional world . It is a funny part because it is not based on reality . So if you think it is a true story about a real event , you would think this film would be based on that .|0
There was n't much thought put into the story line on many fronts . This is a good action movie, but it's like watching a remake of the old Star Wars saga. I enjoyed it, but there is still a ton that could be done to fix some of the flaws in the story . A good action flick, but too much of a plot, and characters, that aren't fleshed out or fully fleshed out. I think that it can be a better film because of these things, but at the end it still wasn't a good film, and that's the point.|0
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film . Trouble is , the content could have been better . There is not enough of a story to take me to anywhere new . Its a great movie , it has some of the best sound effects ever made , and the action is great . What I don't like is the acting in it . I don't really understand all the dialogue , and there are so many bad lines , you can hardly tell what the characters are talking about . It just seems a bit too much.|0
I have recently found this film on one of my husband 's VHS tapes ( the blank variety which he doesn't know how to make) and I am a little disappointed in it because I have never seen any of his films, but I do like the film, so I'm looking forward to getting the next DVD out to enjoy. I don't care what you think of his films, I just want to be entertained, and I like the way this one was done. It's just a little off putting to me but it's like I have no idea of how it was made.|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. Loch Ness Monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. Plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role.|1
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair , hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of the bunch. I hate him, because he's a douchebag who's been trying to sell us all for years now, and has only gotten worse as the years have gone on. I guess I just hate the fact that he gets to come back again, so I guess I need to make myself hate someone else. So far he's managed to get to me twice before I've decided to hate him back. So I guess he has some balls.|0
This is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around. It is heartrending, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius.I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the movie adaptation), and I was just enraptured by the characters. I laughed out loud more than once.|1
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime. Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other).|1
"What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this ? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece of cinema set in the early 90’s. It starts with the opening shot of Clifton at an open-mic night with his friends:

In the background, Clifton and his friends are being introduced. In the foreground, the audience sits. In the background there is a man with his arm around the shoulder of a beautiful woman, holding a guitar in his lap, who has her head down while looking at a screen behind him. She is trying to concentrate on what is on the screen."|0
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what ? ? They get shot. There are no winners and there is always blood. This year there were a lot of blood shed this weekend. I was not surprised but I have to admit my shock was a little bit less at the number of people shot on Saturday night after the game had ended. I guess I expected a little bit of that after all the talk about how there should be no gun violence in the community, but there was plenty on the way.|0
"Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this ""world premiere."" What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production."|1
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! It was showing on a Sky channel over here called ""Zone Horror"" which basically shows crappy B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. Apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was OK, LOL!!! In all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors."|1
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand . What I found was a badly scripted show about a group of high school boys who decide to take on a life or death mission and are forced to work together for a common goal. The kids have a lot in common, but also are very different. There's a bit of humor in there as well, but the end of the episode is not that funny. At the end of the episode, you are supposed to have a moment of confusion after the characters realize who they're working on.|0
"This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante 's great work , distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition. So, I have taken a look at a selection of books that I’ve been meaning to read, and decided that the following titles are at least worthy of attention:

I’m sure you will find a couple that you’ll find interesting, but if not, at least you will see that I’m serious and that these are some of the most important books on philosophy, theology and religion that the world has produced in recent times."|0
I did n't know what to expect from this hugely popular ( and hilarious ) Swedish comedy & satire team and I'm happy & happy to say I was right to be. Lars Ulrich and Per Sundin are a couple of guys with very different ways of looking at a world. Sweden is a country in Europe and in the middle of it is one city called Stockholm (population approx. 6 million). They're both from the same family and their fathers were both doctors. They met when they were 16 years old and they were both working at hospitals in the same area.|0
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning. Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor.|1
My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60 's ... I can still vividly recall that first time when I came back home after a year of studying abroad in Europe. I came back home as a new student in a completely new country. So my first day at home was not as a new student but as a newly arrived student. And that first day of my first school was a very special day for me, as it was the first time that I really saw my family.|0
I do n't understand why some of you ( or many ) have given this film upward of 8 stars when you are not even giving the script a 4 star review. The story was great and I liked the characters and the action sequences. I found the plot to be predictable, predictable. But, there is some nice twists and action sequences and a few nice scenes that are well shot and well acted. Overall, it's worth a rental for me. The only problem is that I feel there is a lack of the originality and style that was missing.|0
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role.|1
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have had her kids taken away by the Department of Children and Families. Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me.|1
Sorry , after watching the credits , I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF series. The game itself is about as good as they come and that's saying something considering all the bad SF that has gone down in recent years. The combat isn't very difficult as it is and the game is fun. It isn't too deep and you will be able to complete it in less than 2 hours and if you don't have a few hours you can always get it on the 3DS/PS3.|0
Look, don't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON! I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I am sorry to be so harsh but come on!|1
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. The acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative.I would pay good money never, ever to see it again. Because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for anything really important.|1
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the pleasure of watching. The whole thing is just so bad that it almost feels like it doesn't have anything to do with other films. I would love to hear some suggestions of what to watch instead. I don't want to leave out anything you want to mention, so if there's a specific movie you think i should watch, that's cool, but this isn't going to be a long discussion. So just leave me a message and i'll check back.|0
This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. But the sex isn't even arousing. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat.|1
Now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn made for TV independent horror films ever made! I normally hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the film was! But somehow I took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film.|1
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Modern love...thats for sure. In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants.|1
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work . The opening scenes are as gripping as can be , and the rest of the film is well worth watching . The film stars a pair of fantastic leads in John Cazale and Richard Jenkins, and as you can tell from what I said above it’s an action packed movie . This film is directed and written by the director of “Shrek” , a film that is the highest grossing animated film in the history of the industry, but this is an even better film in every way.|0
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard living and hard working. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young upstarts of New Labour.|1
This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt police in the form of the Los Angeles County sheriff's department. This one was shot on location around the Los Angeles County jail in the late 1950s, by the same director, David Gordon Green. It starred George Segal and Barbara Stanwyck and featured some great performances by them. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California. You can find clips of the film at the link. It was released to theaters in 1959.|0
"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare 's classic plays , this version of Hamlet does nothing to advance the story's plot, but instead makes it quite difficult to understand the play. I don't know how to write about this. But I wanted to write about it for awhile, so here is the text from the beginning of the play to the beginning of the end. In the next line, we have Shakespeare's play in full. HAMLET



Act 1 Scene 1

Enter three young ladies and a youth in a white coat, and a young lady in green."|0
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel . Here is a quick look at what has happened since. It was a little over 2 years ago when Star Trek Into Darkness came out and it was met with a lukewarm reception. Even the most avid fans were not really excited about it as they had hoped. They wanted more of Spock and Captain Kirk, they wanted the movie to be set on the Enterprise or some sort of Federation starship, or at least something that was a Federation starship.|0
Ninja Hunter ( AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja ) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous style and ridiculous plot twists. This film also has an interesting plot that involves the Ninja as an elite military unit sent to a remote island in the Philippines to train elite soldiers for battle against the American military forces. As I mentioned in the opening, I think this film was great at first. It had a very fast pace and looked really good on DVD. There was a ton of character interaction and a great plot twist that made me smile.|0
"The first thing you should know about ""Zipperface"" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar ""home-video-ish"" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a ""real"" film. And ""Zipperface"" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a ""real"" serial-killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre."|1
What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting , believable plot lines , or anything resembling a sequel to The Dark Knight Rises.It is a remake, and it does not offer anything that is not available in the original. But I did see this coming , and it is quite a lot better than the original. That is why we are all here. To talk about how much better the movie is than its predecessor. But I will be honest, I will not tell you how great the sequel is, because I know you won't like it.|0
This film is just another waste of time . The plot is ridiculous , forced USA drama . The characters are stereotypical and over the top , not believable . And the ending is pointless , as well. I can see why it got mixed reviews. The story isn’t that interesting , I can’t see what this movie could be about . But I have to admit that I don’t find it offensive at all. I’ve been to movies like this where I can relate to what is happening . This film isn’t as deep as this one .|0
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week . Never heard of it before that but it’s definitely on my radar as a new indie film, so check out the trailer and synopsis below. It’s due out on February 7th on Amazon UK and Amazon Prime, and I’m pretty sure I’ll get it on Amazon. What I’ve seen of this film looks promising, though, so I hope it doesn’t disappoint. Check out some of the other trailers we’ve seen below.|0
To start with , I have done some further research on the film . Firslty , Jules Dassin directed and stars in , the story is about a man who falls for an older woman he meets on holiday. It seems that she is as beautiful as she is intelligent, he falls head over heels for her but then, in the middle of an argument , the woman suddenly vanishes leaving him devastated and alone. His search begins in the form of his old friend who has been in a plane crash and can only recall bits of his memories .|0
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter.|1
This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... I am in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius-. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to come by.|1
I just saw this movie . I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent , like all the movie , this movie is good , the storyline is good , and so is the acting. But I think this movie is overrated . This movie is not bad but overrated , and also the plot does not work. I thought the plot was good but this is just not believable. For example if the story line was like the first book . It could be that there is something about this that is true . You have to like the book or the movie to actually buy the book.|0
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was the best movie i saw all this year. i was surprised by a couple of things though but i will let you guys tell you about them. 1) the story was very well written and you can easily guess what the main character will do 2) you can even guess what they will say and what they are really thinking. i found myself wondering why they did such a horrible job and i think there was so much time wasted.|0
Yes , maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that does n't take away from the beauty of this work. There are moments of pure genius in this piece. And I would say if you don't think this is beautiful you would have a very bad time with this film itself. If you think it's not beautiful then I guess this should make you rethink your own perceptions on the matter. I'd say for this to even be worth watching you should have seen it a few more times in the theater.|0
"Dude ... I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but this is too much. I can't believe this is the last thing I say. I can't help but to feel like the writer is saying, ""You'll be watching Buffy and Angel when we're gone."" ... and then he goes right on saying that this show will be more of a comedy, and that we'll have a ""franchise"" where we'll see lots of movies and tons of shows ... and I'm thinking, what?"|0
Wow . Just wow . Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad dream. It's as if, as if we are watching a nightmare , and it's about to become a nightmare. You know how when you're in a bad dream you're watching a movie and you think , oh it's been so long. Well i was just like that. It was like watching a film , but it looked like it was in real life . When i saw that it was a nightmare and i thought , that's how it will look like when it comes out .|0
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy goodness. I have to tell you now, I wasn’t. I’m not even sure when it came out; I just found it in a pile of stuff I’d been working on and so I was excited for what it could bring me. It was really exciting for me to finally have it available on Blu-Ray and DVD. My wife was really looking forward to it too because it’s the first new movie she’s had since she was a teenager.|0
"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy ""Chainsaw massacre""-feeling, everything falls apart.SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these ""fooled-ya""-movies can figure this out.This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind."|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best. She's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992), by the way. However, there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For instance, in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. We also shouldn't forget mentioning Extramarital's three main actors.|1
This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves.|1
My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of `` bad '' movies . . . The first one we watched, a French flick called `` The Curse of the Blue Flower '' was pretty funny. The second one was a film called `` Man with No Name (1931) '' in which the lead character plays the lead role in the original movie and is the last of a famous line up of characters. The second one was probably one of the worst of the bunch, a film called `` The Mummy (1935) . . .|0
"""Son of the Mask"" is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" instead. I must say that it is partially my fault, as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first ""Mask"" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster."|1
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish . I knew we were in for a wasted Christmas . I know we had to do something special to get him back to school so I went and got him an autograph book . I am not kidding here. It was a joke . I had to ask him for the autograph before he even looked at it because I knew I was in trouble . He would not even look at it . I knew he was not happy and that I had messed it up . This was my second autograph of David .|0
I could watch this movie ALL DAY ! I LOVE it . Probably my all time favorite movies . But the only problem is that i dont remember the actors name ! It was the first time i saw the movie and the first one i saw was the opening scene ! LOL I loved it . Then i loved it again . Then a few minutes ago i saw it and it was pretty good ! I am a big fan of John Goodman . The guy is great ! I dont think you can beat his performance . And i liked the songs .|0
"""Strangers on a Train"" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's ""Speed."""|1
"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous""."|1
Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. Paranoia reigns supreme as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's sanity. I've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know.|1
"I 'd never thought that I would be caught saying this : But I think `` Dog the Bounty Hunter "" was very well written and very enjoyable, not only was the book great for those of you who love the action but for those of you who do not, it’s a quick read with no time pressure and an easy-to-understand story. I loved reading it, it has a great mix of romance, action, suspense and mystery, and I loved being able to read it from the perspective of a woman in her early twenties and a man in his mid-forties."|0
"(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, ""Where Do I Go? "", ""Easy to be Hard"", and ""Black Boys/White Boys"". While I have not seen the stage musical, I think that it clouds the judgement of many. This is not the musical you see in theatres. Do not attempt to compare them."|1
"Two little girls strike a friendship . One tries to convince the other she 's a witch . The other tells the first girl that a witch 's not so different from a witch . Then they go and join the witch 's daughter for a game . And all of the children, who have been sent by the witch 's husband , have the same opinion . . . The game of "" The Witch 's Daughter."" And that is how the children of the village are getting ready for the witch 's daughter. And they are also playing with the witch 's daughter ."|0
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.If you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one.|1
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people encouraged the Fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie.|1
Terror in the Jungle is a real find. If you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. It's hilarious!The story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. The crash scene has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blonde boy survives. A nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! I kid you NOT!|1
This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite.|1
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown . I ca n't say it is perfect, but the story it tells is so rich and fascinating. I have a lot of interest in the real life story of Richard Branson, but not enough time in my week to really go into detail on the story of his life, so I'm not going to do it justice here. In this post I want to explain to you what I mean by Branson's influence on me, because I think it will be helpful to others.|0
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made . It is a story told in a steady stream of scenes, that makes you question the truthfulness of everything. I think you need to watch it in order to fully understand what the film is about , because what the movie is about , you need to see it first. You need to watch it from beginning to end. It's the story of this movie. You will not find it anywhere else. I was a little confused to the start because I have been trying to find a movie like this, but I have been unsuccessful.|0
This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the tough as nails, street hustler's wife is great to watch. The acting in the film was outstanding and she looks beautiful as well.The storyline of the film is also good. It's not like a typical gangster film . The film is about a young man who is a street hustler in Mumbai . The plot of the film is simple . he wants to become the leader of the street and become the top of the food chain . He also wants to win the girl .|0

Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric , or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never consider the possibility of people being killed by other people? I don’t get it. What’s even more mystifying is that this entire situation has been covered so completely by mainstream media — with a single exception. And now it is being covered even more thoroughly by you, dear readers, who I am sure don’t need a lecture on what real journalism is all about. The story has a long, interesting history.|0
There 's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee . The bimbo in the office was a bit upset . I guess I was right . She did buy one, and I know she didn't get it for any money . But she has to go to work looking very sexy in the silk underwear and I just can't blame her. So what did we learn? A girl can be a bitch in her underwear but there are some things I can always tell a girl from a woman . That's the one thing. 1.|0
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette.|1
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after the death of his wife in the hit film The Goodbye Girl. But what makes this performance so memorable is that his addiction is not an act of desperation. It is the culmination of Sinatra’s character and the culmination of his life story. While this may seem like an odd choice for a lead role, Sinatra did indeed begin his career with drugs. His drug use was so bad that it was the cause of his demise.|0
I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films . However , I found NO film that I could really identify with . I like comedies and romances . And I have a really good friend that I see almost everyday so I thought maybe that is what I will be seeing in my favorite movies . This film is about a man from the future who has had some problems that have happened in his life . His mother and a couple of his friends who were there for his father , are now in a coma .|0

This is a entertaingly bad b-movie . Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies released today. I really do not care for this movie at all, but there was no reason I would not see this movie if I had the money to waste on it, as I am sure most of you are aware. In fact you should be aware of this one as it does not get much attention. It is however one of those movies where you really can tell what is going on without having the whole movie to read.|0
"Normally I am a typical ""creepy-crawly-hatin'"" girl, but after watching this film (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc. ), and how a plucky young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Honey."|1
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong.|1
Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks?I mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets.

Bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies.|1
"Well it might be a kid 's movie ... perhaps but i 'm not gon na let my kids from 6 months to 3 years old come to the movies. They are too fussed about what they see and think. That is a bit silly. We all have to learn to watch the movies on their own without having to ""fuss"" for them. So if your daughter wants to watch it on her own at the moment, you might want to tell her that. I'm sure you'll see it at a younger age, too."|0
"This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of ""Touching the Void"", one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event, and I'm relieved that it didn't let me down."|1
If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.|1
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary , then later felt the need to apologize. I hope this is the case here, and that this is a sign of the times. But I can understand if someone would be offended. And I think that the majority of posters are honest and respectful people so that is just as valid of an explanation as any. I'm just hoping that this particular post will not offend anyone and that it can remain on the site. Thank you all for your time and I hope your weekend is going well.|0
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence . Some Northern idiots come out to say they want to stop us from ever letting the South out of the Union, which they call “separate but equal”, but they want us to stop the South from expanding west and to stop the North in the first place. It is funny to hear idiots saying that to try to stop the Civil War from happening. To try to stop slavery and Jim Crow? No, no, no – let that go to hell!|0
A young man, named Danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named Bix, who agrees to tag along with Danny and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the town creep, Jesse (played by a perfectly casted Jack Elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie.|1

This was absolutely one of the best movies I 've seen . Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that really made the movie. The movie was funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and entertaining. The cast was outstanding, and I am looking forward to seeing them in the future. I have seen many movies that try to do a similar job, but this was the most fun I have had at a cinema since I started watching TV shows and movies. I would have given it a 4/5 if it didn't suck so bad.|0
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad. This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and cliché', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch this on lifetime, I'd recommend it highly as a comedy.|1
And so it started with `` Shreik '' a send up of horror films , then we had Scary Movie, and we ended with the worst movie I have ever seen on a screen in my lifetime. And, of course, Shreik was a huge box office bomb. And, of course , I thought, I must have done something wrong because the movie was so horrible. This movie is not for kids. Kids do not go for this kind of stuff. But, I had to try it because I was in the business.|0
Well, this is new...Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called...Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films.|1
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero . He 's got LOSER but I'm not going to give away his origin or anything, just say ""I'm the hero of the town."" That's all."" I think they're going to get better later on but I can't say that's going to happen until later. And they're going to get a bunch more new characters, so I'm sure it will be worth it. But, at the same time, I just don't know if I'll like it anymore."|0
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie . The acting is astonishing , the movie itself is powerful . The movie is well made . The story moves fast and is not predictable . If I have to choose a book for the movie to go on I would go for The Book Thief . Hilarious, well made, well researched, and a very interesting look into a fascinating story of an American hero. I was not impressed by this movie . I think that this is a movie which should be seen more often . I don't understand why this movie is not out there more often .|0
This movie is all about reality , submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science . There were many technical faults in this movie as it tries to explain things which actually happened in many places , for example we have to understand that the submarines had radar and that the submarine would send out an SOS and the enemy would come back and destroy it . They have to do the same in the other theaters and the enemy had to do the same there . Some parts of the movie are very interesting . The submarine commander who has been in submarines for 40 years .|0
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward...granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be, but i thought this was amazingly well-acted, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in exectution. i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play, it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick. i am also a great fan of alan rickman, so that might be my bias.|1
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by Bodrov Sr.'s hackneyed and confusing script, which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. Most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited.|1
Without saying how it ended , it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes of play to about thirty seconds, or to give you a better idea, about seventy-five seconds of play. In fact, from that point onward, it is pretty clear to see that the game will not have a lot going for it. It has some nice things, but they're all fairly standard at best. This is the game that, if you want to win the game, you have to run it through at a pretty high speed, which takes a bit of work on your part.|0
Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin 's Dolemite . This is the single greatest piece of filmmaking ever produced .... By far one of the most influential films ever made . It's influence is everywhere in our lives today. It's also something I never thought I would become .... By far the most expensive film ever made . Of course , I'd pay $100 for a ticket to this movie . But I have a feeling that people will be paying $50 , $100 , and more for tickets. And they probably will be paying for tickets that are worth nothing because of this film .|0
"One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit I never got into the original show.... Okay, so I never watched it at all. But the new show is impressive.Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows."|1
"""Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable"", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries, it is stunningly photographed, directed with lurid enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist."|1
"Now , lissen you guys , I LOVED THIS FILM , though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE WILDS , I think . the story is very interesting . if you like westerns , western movies , or cowboy stories , this is a film you should watch . as an aside , I also recommend . the best movie of 2000 . it's a pretty bad movie , in fact , but it's worth seeing . it was on the "" must see top ten list"" 
for the entire year of 2000 . it's about a sheriff's daughter who has inherited the family business ."|0
I just found out before writing this review that `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' and another movie called `` Curse of Cobra '' are two of my personal favourites and my absolute favourites of all the films I've seen in my lifetime. So, it was with great excitement that I got the chance to see Komodo vs. Cobra (2009) and I found that this movie is the most amazing one I've ever seen. I know I said in my review about the previous two movies I watched, I was very satisfied.|0
Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it.|1
I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations , having just graduated college and moved on to work full-time in my chosen profession. The episode had me at least a bit concerned. However, once I started watching the show, and it began to become my reality, I knew that I would have to watch this series to see whether or not my concerns were valid. So, I went into the show and watched episode 1, and thought this was really well done, from the opening scenes to the ending.|0
This is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide, all-American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly.|1
"I 've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I 've always wondered if Man Ray had ever done any work of any real quality. In a few rare instances his photography has appeared in books. The only one of those that I am aware of is an article by the late Gabor Paty in ""Photomagnetique"" No. 6 (September 1960). I have a copy of that article, and I think this was the first time anyone ever made the connection between Man Ray and photography, so it was a very important piece."|0
GOLD RAIDERS ( 1951 ) A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges ( including Shemp Howard at this point ) as their sidekick. It was the highest-grossing film for Paramount Pictures in 1950 ( the highest grossing Paramount film ) and it's the only feature that The Three Stooges have made. It was also considered one of their worst films. It is considered to be a classic of all of their films and of the early 20th century, with a few modern elements thrown in. It also is a great parody of westerns in general and the genre itself.|0
Just awful . It 's almost unbelievable that , with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett , such a well known name could have created such a shoddy script and story. It has all the marks of a first person point-and-shoot horror flick but it's all thrown together rather haphazardly. That said it's an enjoyable watch nonetheless. It's too bad it wasn't a movie, because there's a lot to like about the film. In fact, I'm quite fond of it (although it may have a few flaws and I don't enjoy it as much as others).|0
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I thought it looked very entertaining. Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time.|1
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I am biased to the A&E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth.The characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believable.Darcy was portrayed tolerably well, I will grant him.|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars . Quite a statement from the man who, as a kid in the fifties, was given the most coveted prize that was bestowed upon the actor with the biggest heart. “If you’d asked me then who was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, who’d ever walked the earth, I think that I would’ve said she was Helen of Troy, because I thought she was the most beautiful I’d ever seen” – Robert Mitchum.|0
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel . They call it Vampires : The Turning. What was up with that? I could have sworn they said it was a vampire and not the vampire... but that doesn’t really matter right now, not really, what do I care anyway. It was good to see it for the first time and even better not to, I think it was a bit predictable. But I guess that’s why I like to do this. The actors are great and they have great acting chops.|0
I've watched the movie actually several times. And what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. Not even those silly model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... Burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. Even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too.|1
"Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for ""Glory Enough for All"", a British series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was ""Danger UXB""."|1
"Y'know , it 's very interesting watching this ... half the people involved with it are now dead ... Anyways, it 's getting to the point where we can't say ""this is how it happened."" ""This is how it really happened."" ""Is this really the truth about what really happened on July 9th?"" ""That 's the most important question that needs to be asked. ""Was it the 9th?"""" ""We can't ask that because we can't really believe what we 've seen on TV or in books or in documentaries."""|0
Almost missed it . While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 ` s , I was channel surfing when I noticed a woman sitting alone in a restaurant across from the restaurant that was being shown on a local television channel. The woman was seated at an empty table that was facing a television that was showing a show called I'm A Celebrity. At the very moment the woman saw me, she was looking directly at a screen that was displaying the show. She was smiling and laughing while she watched the show on television.|0
"The first few minutes of this movie do n't do it justice ! For me , its not funny until I got a hint of what was coming !

The movie follows the story line as the girl and guy meet in a hotel room and they meet each other one by one, they had a relationship and they were happy for each other and the guy left the hotel room because he was angry.|0

This movie was so poorly acted . What was with Jeff Bridges accent , horrible and unbelievable . Was it scripted or did he not get his lines ? Was he really that hot and how come he was the only actor who played him ? I saw it the first time in theaters and then again a couple of years ago on HBO. I saw it again on the red eye. I can only imagine how hard it is to be an actor these days. I watched the first one and I didn't see it again till today, but it was such an amazing film that I'm glad I saw it.|0
If you loved the 1993 ( erotic , sci-fiction ) cyborg film `` Nemesis '' , then you 'll love this remake of the same name , directed by and starring a young A-lister in the leading role, James Franco. The story of James Franco 's rise in the world of cinema, and his transformation from a geek to a man on fire, is riveting, and the director/writer of the original is a master storyteller, but this is also one of the finest films in the genre , with a stellar cast of stars.|0
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... I don't get it. I was reading an article this morning that said that when a director doesn't know how to shoot it, he or she probably doesn't know how to shoot it in the first place. Well, I guess that's what happened to this thing. It's not like it was an incredible movie in any way, it has some pretty good acting going, and a couple of good scenes.|0
"Although it is n't mentioned very often , `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' is a very interesting song , which you should definitely listen to. There are a few lines in particular which stand out and I think will make for a more enjoyable experience. There are a lot of songs which have been made popular over the years but few are as good, and one of those is "" Do n't Look"". The video is also great to watch. There are some very cool visuals as well , which is a bonus."|0
"I am a huge Eric Roberts fan , I collect his movies and so far has get to 60 . He did a fine job . I really hope he makes a comeback . I have a few friends that I have worked with . I can honestly say that they all worked very hard for Eric and I will always be grateful for that. I will miss this guy

I can't believe it has been 6 years since I have seen this movie. I was lucky enough to be invited for dinner with Eric Roberts last November at his home and that was the first time I met his family."|0
This `` film , '' and I use that term loosely , reminds me of the first joke my daughter said , ''I want my mom to look like this.'' I'm not sure if that meant that I have to be an ugly woman to make her happy , or if she meant that she had to be an ugly woman , or what. Anyway, my point is , I do feel I have been a woman who has been made to feel inadequate , especially in the last five years , because I have felt so insecure about myself, I've felt so out of place.|0
I'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. This movie is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made.|1
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose.The music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although I did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie.|1
Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic `` Godfather '' and yet another case of over-hype due to the presence of Michael Madsen-is this one. In the original `` Godfather II '' there is no way to look at this movie and not think of George Michael in the best of his heyday. Here is a movie which takes its time to get the feel of the whole picture while still keeping the gangsters in the foreground. This time Michael is not around to lend his services, this time the role goes to Robert Duvall.|0
I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye-rolling lines and subplots. It is well made and I can understand the message but it really drags on and it is so poorly written that there are times when I find myself wondering where the script was even written. The movie is well paced and has a decent story to it so it can be watchable. Just not my cup of tea. But hey, that’s just my opinion. If you haven’t given this film a try, you should go see it now!|0
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time.|1
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as supposed washed up beach stud Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of LA on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman.|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and candid performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm certain it couldn't have attained the Dante-style depths that this one did.|1
Why are there no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the Japanese officers brown nose Jim Brown's character.This is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.This is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun.|1
"The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) . Her show has been around for ten years. One night, she stops in to a country club where she catches a glimpse of the handsome guy from her local station. Erica is so happy that she goes up to him and he says, ""Hi Erica!"" She tells him she's been trying to get out of town for a few weeks. He tells her not to go back to the station. So Erica tells her friends that she's just in town on vacation."|0
It 's 2005 , my friends ... a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology . So much has changed in the past six years or so , but nothing that we see on our screen today. There have been advances in the technology of photography , in film making and in cinema , and so it is hard for a film to stand out as it did in the past. There have also been advances in the special effects industry , but there are still areas where films are not as visually striking as they used to be.|0
"This is a movie that deserves another look -- if you have n't seen it for a while , or if you're just tired of mindless action flicks , then I can definitely recommend it . It's a good movie , though a bit repetitive, and it was a bit slow to film. I'm going to get to the meat of the movie pretty quick , because I love this movie so much and I really need to finish this review . And now I'll say it: I really like this film, but I don't think that I would even call myself a ""true fan""."|0
If you enjoy riddles and suspense , you will enjoy this movie . Truth be told it was mostly the sound of the camera that captivated my attention this time around .

In 1968 , Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark . His masterpiece was not only considered by many to be one of the best sci-fi movies ever made , but he also added to this by creating a world where humans had different levels of intelligence. In this day and age, it’s still rare to see a science fiction or a fantasy movie with such an intricate plot and characters who have so many different aspects to their personalities and abilities. It’s a good thing then that the book that inspired this movie is still so relevant to the modern day.|0
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_ , and _The Wild Life_ comes up with some similar jokes. _Fast Times_ is a lot funnier, a lot darker, and has a lot more ""bad guys,"" and I think the comparisons between the two stories are apt. And _The Wild Life_ is definitely _more_ ""true"" in the sense of being based on actual real life incidents. But it's really just another TV show, or a TV movie, and that's its biggest merit."|0
Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn't the worst I've ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I've mentioned.Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.Does this make sense...no?|1
My first post at the IMDb has to ( unfortunately ) be to warn others not to waste their time with movies that aren't worth their time. And if you see the film you see the movie for a reason; I am sorry but I can't really explain. I can try to tell you but I'll probably fail. For one thing, you don't get to see the film you see it for a reason. But I also think that is a bad excuse and I am also going to explain why. I have done many posts on other topics that have more to them.|0
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days , Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than for a deep emotional experience. A lot of the time, it has the feel of a Hollywood movie and the dialogue and acting are not that well done. However, there are a few moments that are a bit deeper and more thought provoking. Cimarron is no exception. The plot is pretty straight forward as there are very few changes in the timeline. This is made evident when the movie takes place in the early part of the 19th century.|0
If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman dumps Ripe on us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is this?|1
"This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, ""well, it's a comedy show,"" so I'll laugh, I guess.I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.Why can't America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.She is not funny."|1
When the movie first started I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics, I started liking it. The plot was different than anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was, the creatures where only there for a short time. I can only assume this was for money reason.The good side was that the movie was very entertaining.|1
"This film, also known as ""don't look in the basement"" is actually not bad. It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. I thought the acting , which seemed forced at first, somehow got better as the film went along. It seems like the actors really got into their roles."|1
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I did n't want to watch it , but I thought it was really good, so I thought I would do it and he did too.So I was wondering where they are going to go with the ending, and now I've read the ending I don't really have any complaints. I like the ending, but I don't really get why he got to kill him. I'm not really sure. I think he was trying to kill himself to avenge his father.|0
Comedy ? What 's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions ( by the time I got up at 9am) and then not wanting to leave the house for over 6 weeks ? You think I 'm a comedy man ? I 'm not ! I 'd love to know what it would take for you to laugh at this story. It's funny because it happened to us all, but it would be interesting to see what you'd laugh at. You may laugh, I might even laugh a little. But you won't laugh, you won't even see the joke.|0
***SPOILERS*** Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold pouring rain.|1
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley. Yet there is one moment, typical Wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the Indian wife of Gable. She has gone to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Nada. One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema.|1
"I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful , predictable , embarrassing movie even a 3rd-4th or 5th rating, because I think it deserves much better. I say that because this film is much better than you might think it to be. And this is true for most of it. If you have never seen the movie, you can go on IMDB right now to see what I think of it. The Movie

The movie begins where many movies begin. A group of terrorists have decided to hold a protest in downtown, and they are calling for an anti-war protest."|0
"I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some dialogue snippets:Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): ""You see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, the other fills. It is so with the world. At present, you are full of power. But you're spilling it, wastefully. And Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket."" Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past."|1
`` Yesterday '' as a movie , is hard to rate . The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10 from me . The acting is great as well , particularly by the young cast . The music '' is also fantastic . I have seen all the movie and will be seeing ' '' tomorrow , but I can see why it was a box-office flop . Not that it '' would '' have '' been a bad movie if it hadn't been a huge hit . The story was a tad weak , and it would have benefited from a few more plot details , including the reason for the war .|0
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie , but a solid flick in all respects . Everything from acting to cinematography and editing makes this one of the best of the summer . There's something here for everyone and this can be a very well-rounded movie . It's one of those rare summer movies that everyone is willing to go to their local multiplexes to watch . I'm just not sure what's going to happen next . I hope it picks up where the last movie left . If not , I'm ready to start seeing the movie . This movie had some really cool ideas and it worked well.|0
Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics , which is one reason you should never assume that yours is the right one. After all, if the critics are wrong about your particular movie, you're likely right. If they're right, you're right. If you're wrong, you're wrong. And if they're all wrong, you are, and the movie will be, you know, good. This is what happens when critics write for national audiences. They don't care whether you make great movies.|0
While my kids enjoyed the movie ( and announced afterward that they want to buy it later ) I think the movie would not be as enjoyable for kids as it is for adults. And I know it would be less entertaining for adults if they couldn’t find the characters and story, but they’d enjoy the movie more. It’s still not great, but then, I’ve seen better movies than this. As for the kids who don’t like it, why would they be able to tell me which characters to like?|0
A recent re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri.|1
This is one great , sweeping , movie you will remember for a long time . It is about history and that is why you need to watch it . This is not a romance , it is not a comedy , it is not an epic , it is just a movie about history . So you will not be disappointed . It is a film about the life and times of John F. Kennedy from the age of 14 to the age of 41. It is a film about politics and politics alone. It is about life and death and about love.|0
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn.|1
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content. The uniforms and weaponry of both the U.S. and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weaponry of the Berbers were perfectly accurate as well. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful. Procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for.|1
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.|1
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection . They take it in the face every single time, but it doesn’t make any difference, it has absolutely zero effect on you. The only way to make it not so frustrating is to just get to the video first. You could always click on any of the pre-loaded videos, but that only takes you to a pre-filed video, there’s nothing to make it more enjoyable or enjoyable. All I wanted was the video. I knew what it would be and what it had to offer.|0
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew that I had to see this movie, even though I can't say I'm a soccer fan. But watching this just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it.Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it.|1
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn't seen or even heard of.Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.|1
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst . Saw is just that.The movie is bad in so many ways and the only thing it is great is that the story is a great piece of fiction. I have watched it many time but it is just that bad. The fact that this is made with the best actors in the business is not good. It is a shame. The plot is a piece of fiction and I don't know how the director went about this. There are a number of ways you can make a movie bad .|0
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 ""Musical Thriller"" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to ""shield her from all the evils of the world."" The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where Todd is concerned."|1
"This movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is ""going down"" in the America of the late 1960's. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes.If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days,.. just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids! Thank God, his career rebounded before his untimely death.The writers on this television turkey were clueless."|1
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!!|1
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero , who takes down the man , but he is in a very small role , which he has to endure. This film is the second one I ever saw , but I have to agree with the first one , that it is one of my favorite films about pussies. I am a sucker for this kind of stuff , which I have done for years. There are many reasons I enjoy this type of movies and this one is no exception.|0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat.|1
Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane.|1
After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential.|1
I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it . So charming and so full of emotions . If you are into romance or any type of love stories this movie will be a treat. I thought it was great and I recommend it . There were a lot of things that I liked from it . The plot was great and you could tell that they were trying really hard. There was romance in it , but I feel that it would have been very good to see the story go from one stage to the next without the romance.|0
"For a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment, but certainly not here. Even the ""miracle"" scenes were contrived & un-believable. And what's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story?"|1
"This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. ""THE HOLLOW"" is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either."|1
With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog).|1
Some sort of accolades must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline'. It's actually out Full-Mooned Full Moon. It bears all the marks of, say, your `Demonic Toys' or `Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish.|1
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 's exploitation film , except it was done in the early 80 's and it was shot for a $1.00 budget . It is a very funny horror/mystery film. I don't think the film was even released until 1984 . The only thing I know about the film is it was made in the 70s and it had a great title , but I couldn't find an information about the production date on it. I don't remember any special effects and I didn't pay a lot of attention to it, I just watched the trailer .|0
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears.|1
Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times.|1
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery). He hooks up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!).|1
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.I'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin.|1
"This is a cult classic for sure! !It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want "" to view the world differently"" then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout."|1
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. What?! That's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.|1
Apparently this movie was based on a true story . I 'm not sure how accurate it is , though. There is an interesting plot , but in my mind it seems out of place . I do like the film . My wife loves it . She said it was really funny , so it must be true . And , I agree . The story is entertaining and I would say this movie is a good time killer. My wife says she is laughing so hard she could 't get a word in . I really enjoyed this movie . I think we should all rent this movie .|0
"Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in ""Danger Signal,"" a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment."|1
Forget what I said about Emeril . Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all the time. You don't even want to know what she does for a living because you'll have to go look up stuff on her website. She just seems to have a way with people... I don't watch Food Network because of Rachael Ray . I've been there, done that. I'd rather just be left alone to watch my favorite tv shows, movies, whatever I want to watch without having to worry I'll get yelled at.|0
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there . A sexy comedy , but not as sexy as a love story. It's about love and friendship and how the people around you that you can rely on to give you a second chance at happiness are no longer with you . A few years ago , I came to the conclusion that I might not like anime anymore. But I did enjoy it , and there are still things in my mind I'd like to make it a reality.|0
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/campy/mature themes. I was not disappointed. After watching the second episode, it made sense. The second episode is a little bit long, but it doesn't detract from the first in terms of story or execution. I did however find it distracting as I felt there were a lot of unnecessary twists and turns that took up too much of the second episode and left me wanting more from the overall story. This is definitely something that I would consider to be part of a series.|0
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, ""Falscher Bekenner"" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title (""Low Profile"").Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests."|1
"There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. This is the typical, ""I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army."""|1
A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast . Not one person is known to be dead and it is unknown if all are alive. The bomb was designed by the military to destroy an air base. It is not clear if the survivors are in any way connected with the bomb.The blast happened at approximately 9:02 am CST. It is possible that the bomb may have been placed inside the military base or in the airfield itself, but a search is still ongoing.All the survivors that survived are still alive.|0
"The horrific production doesn't qualify as a ""film."" It was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! There is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a ZERO!The plot is contrived and ridiculous. A late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? PLEASE!"|1
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on TV or I've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much of a mess.ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first time director and it shows.|1
Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid . Now think what would happen if you did? What would happen if in a movie or in reality you saw yourself as you used to be? Imagine what the person you see in the movie or in reality would look like and feel like, and what they would do next, and what their life in general would look like, how they would live and what their goals are and their dreams, and the list goes on . You may say: I’m just fantasizing, but I can see myself as I was.|0
This movie was extremely boring . I only laughed a few times . I decided to rent it when I saw the first time but the ending of the second time made me want to go and see the whole thing . There is one scene in particular that really stuck with me. It is about a man in a hospital with his wife. He was being held hostage by some crazed person . When he finally realized his wife was gone , he says he can’t believe he still lives , he is just so stunned. He can’t even tell his wife that she’s gone .|0
If you 're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara , the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro in the height of the 1960s Cuban revolution, you have come to the right place. On February 28, 1967, the young and charismatic Che, his revolutionary brothers, and the entire revolutionary youth movement of Cuba met at the Plaza de Mayo. It was the day that the revolution that Fidel Castro led and the people who helped him win that revolution finally came together in a common effort for liberation and freedom. But that moment wasn't captured in the media, nor was it made into movies or novels.|0
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't.|1
"I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on back about ""an overzealous, evangelical Christian do-gooder,"" and identifying as an evangelical Christian, myself, I thought, ""Ooohthis should be interesting."" And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough, all too familiar."|1
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war.|1
Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places.|1
This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.|1
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he's to quit touring and the other Boys calls him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group.|1
"I probably have to blame myself but I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the name ""The Hangover II"". It was a fun ride. I'm glad I was there. I know, I know, this is too much to take in but I've seen the movie. It is still a fun ride (for me anyways) and even better when you see the original movie, ""The Hangover"". Anyway, the best part about seeing the original movie is seeing how the characters interact and talk about how they really think."|0
This really is a cringe making exercise . Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes and characters and the soundtrack is just embarrassing. But it is funny at the same time! The film is based around two young brothers who fall in love and are torn between wanting to be in love for real and wanting to protect their brother from the same thing. The film itself is made up of two different stories but the movie is the same. The idea is that you fall in love and you can either protect that love or be with your brother for real.|0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made . Huevos de oro seems to have been the most famous, but its influence on the development of the Mexican cinema cannot be ruled out. To me it’s a film that has been around forever, with its roots in the early 1930s . It’s great to see a film that was made so long ago because it’s a great example of Mexican art and craft. The film was made with a budget of 4 million dollars and it wasn’t just a film, its an experience.|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment . I watched this not expecting too much from it at all, as I did not plan on giving this show another season and did not really care if it would be good or not (I know that I will have a very hard time watching the second season when I have to make a decision about whether I watch this again or not, since I do not think I will want to continue this show) but as I thought about it, I really loved it, and I think that it deserves to be watched again.|0
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.|1
Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema , and it 's way better than I expected . The film follows the adventures of three different characters, all of whom have different personalities and backgrounds and in the end , they meet again . The film features some great music and cinematography too , but for the life of me I can't get out of my mind the fact that it was filmed entirely inside one room , with none of the people or surroundings visible . I won't spoil the story for you in the end , so if you like it , then keep on watching .|0
I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed. The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it.|1
"In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp 's life in his own words. He died in 1985. In his own words:

I wanted to be a movie director: but I wanted to be a novelist, not a movie director

I’ve been doing both. In the early 1970s I’d wanted to be a novelist and screenwriter. I did the first. But the second one was more of an intellectual exercise. The thing I did most was write plays. I did two of those, and I did them badly."|0
This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie 's work , a lifeless , muddled mystery in which you can't figure out where to go , how to escape from it or what to do with the rest of the time . I won't give anything away but you might want to stop reading now. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of this film is . . . oh , that's right , the film is made by a director named Robert Altman who is from the director of the best crime thriller of the 90's and a very successful director .|0
"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material."|1
"Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a ""forbidden"" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding."|1
"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream."|1
Sorry I couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ain't.|1
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe, so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy).|1
"This movie was pointless. I can't even call it sci-fi, since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space. ""Max Q"" isn't even set in space for the entire movie. The story/plot is unoriginal, the cast isn't anything to write home about, although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film... Furthermore, it's not particularly exciting or well-told. At least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally bland."|1
"This ""film,"" and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: ""P.U., stinky poopies!"" Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. That said, there are a few bright spots. The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be."|1
This film is replete with sentimentality , unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe , and irrelevant material that makes me laugh. At the same time, I enjoyed the movie and it is an easy movie to like and learn from. If you have any questions about the film, don’t hesitate to ask and I will be more than happy to answer. It would be hard to beat this movie in terms of overall quality of the film. This is not a bad movie but it doesn’t have to be. It just need to be well acted by the actors.|0
"As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who, well... are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget. Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films?FBI capture two buddies and send them to ""New Alcatraz,"" where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests.First rate acting all around, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys."|1
... when we all know , no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of stuff I found it interesting how they had taken this subject matter and made it seem like something that was real.I have read and will continue to read further on this. I am still looking forward to the series and I am happy to see what comes next, as it's been a while since they did an episode I found interesting. It's interesting, I've read some reviews of the BBC version and I like the way you described what they did with it.|0
"I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the ""secret base"" was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors."|1
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment.Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way of wasting it.It was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted.|1
"Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. The actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.This production offers the disclaimer, ""For dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts"", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a Bible story which needed no drama added."|1
Oh , Yawn . Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even with the pig's. Oh , no , we're not going to do another one of the men are pigs and the women will get even with the pig's films. I am not even going to say I don't love the movie . I love it . But it is not one of the best films of the last year. I love it . I hate to see it again . I will never watch the remake . I don't think the remake is a masterpiece .|0
Firstly, let me make it clear that I love aircraft, and usually any film with them in is worth watching - and I've sat through some shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this Strategic Air Command promotional film. The acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography.|1
I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life , and each time I watch it the character’s are very real . . . . . So how is this movie that’s so true to the books, really real? How can you see characters from all over the place in this movie? I mean, we all know the character’s , but you never see them. In fact, you might not even have a clue of what’s going on, because they appear and disappear from the scene too quickly to make an impression.|0
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.You will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. You've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.Next, enter absolute rubbish talent.|1
Just how bad ? Well , compared to this movie , Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane . There 's the movie , the music , the effects , the set design , the direction , the costumes , even the acting . And yet , there 's still only one line of dialogue . That line is : I 'm the only one who can't tell which guy's a cannibal . I can 't tell the difference ! I think I 've seen this movie more times than I have had the time to really think about this movie.|0
"The recent documentary `` The Adventures of Errol Flynn '' is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero . . . errolflanfadenf

Friday, July 25, 2008

It's hard to argue with the fact that Errol Flynn had more movies in his lifetime than any other actor who ever lived. Flynn, who died just a few years ago today at 88 years young, is one of our most influential actors . . . a giant of a man, the ultimate Hollywood icon, arguably the greatest actor of all-time and the greatest screen presence we will ever see in motion pictures."|0
"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! ""The Beginning"" was not the greatest either but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. It's just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. I understand why this movie was redone as ""The Beginning""."|1
"Its gon na be hard to make this fill 10 lines .... But ill give it a try ( just to know if theres any issues with this line. Thanks in advance )

I can't seem to copy/paste what I have in that file. So, I have to do it with a line by line copy and paste

Thanks in advance for your help. Any further questions? I'm just trying to understand why this doesn't seem to be working the way it is supposed to. Also, do you have a good link to the file I have?"|0
"So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; this is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now both of us had seen to the first two Scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we notice a picture of Ken Shamrock (""The World's Most Dangerous Man"") on the cover."|1
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through!|1
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist.Some one at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.A few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks so much, Sci-Fi!|1
In Michele Soavi's confusing art-house zombie film, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long. Aided by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade.However, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred, Francesco finds himself busier than ever beforeHaving garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officianados, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.|1
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of ""The Comebacks"" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks"" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie."|1
Significant Spoilers ! This is a sick , disturbing movie ... just like the sick , twisted director , Jennifer Lynch. It's sick, disturbing and it's got some very bad writing too ... it's very disturbing , even more so than in the first. The fact is, I don't want to spoil anything, even in the last chapter. What you have to understand is that this movie does contain some very disturbing elements in terms of the scenes, the story, etc. However, I have to admit that some of it is so disturbing to me that I'm afraid it may have been spoiled.|0
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport . She 's been in a concentration camp, a jail, a prison. Her husband died in the concentration camp, and they have a boy who doesn 't speak. They have nowhere to go and no way to support the boy. But they are given a chance. A chance at a better life. And this chance is to be found in the most extraordinary of all places – a prison camp in the UK. This is not a documentary film.|0
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. This anti-Bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film.In its campy, inane way, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion.|1
This film , for what it was set out to be , succeeded . It 's a short tragic film about two young men , who have a child , and how it affects them both. The young man , who is a painter, has lost his father . He takes the blame for him . His mother has died, and the father wants him to leave . The younger man , on the other hand , wants to remain in the country where he is from . The film ends with his mother and father talking about the child , and how it is now his responsibility , to care for her .|0
We all enjoyed the movie . It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos . It was also very well acted and the performances of the leads was very realistic and convincing . It is also well directed . There is not much violence in it . You have to love the humor . There are many jokes in this movie . You must have this movie for yourself . A lovely family friendly movie . You will not regret it . This is a wonderful movie . There is a family friendly movie with humor . It has fun and many laughs .|0
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.The Good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about Theresa ChanThe Bad :The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No linkage between the 3 story lines. Minimum DIALOGUE in the film, substituted by SMSs and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.|1
"This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see ""Free Enterprise"" instead."|1
"Like classic Hollywood musicals , the plot is just an excuse . A must see for those interested in French cinema and French culture . This is definitely something that has to be watched in full. Review by:
Eugène Lévy

Rating:

What do you get if you mix great movies, great actors, and an exceptional script ? I have been a huge fan of ""La Grande Illusion"", a French musical based on ""Daphné"" by the French writer Jules Verne (who also wrote ""Toujours là"" and ""Jules Verne"" by Jules Dassin ."|0
I find it amazing, that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). OK, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-Poles. Screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - awful. It's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. P.S.|1
Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings.|1
Are you kidding me ? This is quite possibly the worst , amateur movie I 've ever seen . The characters are bad . The acting is mediocre . There are no surprises , and the plot line is so weak , that I could have guessed that this would have been a horror flick . ( I am sure many others would , and you probably guessed that as well ). I think this is the worst amateur movie I've seen all year . It doesn't get much better than this . It's like a low budget horror flick , but instead of zombies it has aliens .|0
"I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible ! I expected it to be good but it was not ! I did enjoy it , though , and I really hope they make it into a series ! As for the book, I can't say I was a fan of it, it was just kind of a ""what could have been"" kind of movie with an interesting premise that didn't quite work for me. It was very well acted and I enjoyed it but for some reason the ending was kind of anticlimactic for me."|0
I watched 5 % of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole thing so I can figure out exactly what you and your friends are talking about in your blog posts, and that's fine by me but what I find interesting is how it's been a couple of days since you've posted something and I've been looking for it for a while now and haven't had a single reply. You know, I'm not so much concerned with how long I've been out of a post as how I'm not seeing anything at all that I wanted to write about.|0
"I can't remember the series, I believe it may have been ""American Masters"", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why."|1
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests...|1
I must first mention that as a group of mates , we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are not so good for us as a community , so we would like to make some suggestions for you all to enjoy . We are all from a very wide variety of backgrounds, and we have many tastes . However , we are all very much in love with the wonderful things in life , in fact we all spend most of our time looking forward to our nights out and going out on our date nights , because we know we are not the only ones who have those nights .|0
This movie was a major bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well.......I think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors.|1
I simply cannot understand how any Who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here.|1
"I found West Point to be an agreeable film, although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's ""Huddle"" (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking."|1
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada -- particularly in Quebec . That 's because this film is based on a real event. The film is based on a real story and I was there to see it. So I have nothing but respect for the filmmakers, the subject and the people who were really involved with the movie production. I would be the last one to disparage an artist, but in my opinion, this film is far too realistic. This is what the real story is. So if the film is so realistic then why make it into such a horror/sci-fi film?|0
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen, and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death.The story begins with introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie.Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named ""Summerfest"". In this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class."|1
28 years before 9/11 , there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile , and it was also the beginning of the Chilean War for Independence. In order to mark the day that Chile had declared itself as a country, a memorial was erected in the city of Santiago . In the same city there was also another one , this one commemorating the victims of the earthquake on April 19, 2010 . The event had a great impact in Chile and it became one of the most widely known tragedies of the nation .|0
This was a nice film. It had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. The storyline kinda reminded me of The City of God. But this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. It had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south Africa. The actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked Estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable.|1
The most obvious flaw ... horrible , horrible script . This movie had a potentially good story , but it doesn't work . There should not be a sequel or a continuation . There are only about 2 or 3 good scenes . I'm sorry , but there are many flaws in this film . You know how many flaws are there already . And if you see this movie , you should watch the last scene , because there are still many flaws . You know how bad the last scene was . I can't think of any good scenes , there is just too many flaws .|0
"My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie . I've seen it before so it's a must see. I just don't think it's right for a young adult audience. For my own personal entertainment this weekend I will see and rewatch ""The Conjuring."" I love horror movies and I am glad I don't need to pay money to watch them. I'm not sure why you are posting a list of horror movies, but you obviously don't appreciate the horror movies I love. I like both of them."|0
In Fassbinder 's earlier films , his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them . He was always a master storyteller , from his early days as an actor to the time he was first making movies for the screen . While some of his later movies might have been a bit more obvious or obvious , they are still very entertaining . I 've seen him on the small screen , and his work as director was always good . I thought he was great at making his films interesting , and he did a great job , so I 'm really glad to see his movies being released on BluRays .|0
"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior."|1
"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must."|1
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch. With such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. The excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. The photography in Empire Falls was lovely.|1
What to say about this movie? A married couple has more then just each other. After playing around for some time things gets more serious. A difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. This movie seems to be very low budget. But a good story don't have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.|1
"I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live .I just can't wait to finish this movie as I love the story. It's very funny to watch. You should give it a try. I highly recommend to you and I hope you enjoy the movie and I am looking forward to see what is going to follow. Best regards

I've always wanted to read Turkish, I've seen many Turkish films and now I can't get my hands on Turkish books."|0
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and over the top , while it tries too hard at comedy . I’ll be honest , I didn’t expect much, but I actually enjoyed this movie. This movie is not bad , nor is it great . It has a lot of potential . The only thing that stood out to me during this movie was that it has a good soundtrack and that the ending didn’t feel like a huge let down.|0
Let 's get one thing straight : I like much of Snipes ' work . Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries he has no real talent and is usually not in his top form. I hope he will come back though and perform more regularly in the next few years as I do like his music a lot . In the meantime he should work with some new talent to make him a better performer. I do not want to be rude in the thread but that was a poor writeup and it makes it seem as though the OP was not a fan of the show.|0
This movie baffled me . I could not get a grip on it . Thought I might be missing something . I watched the first 3 parts but didn't watch the whole thing . The story was great . I really enjoyed the movie . Even though there was not much gore . The movie was funny . But not very nice. It was just too funny . As for the story , I didn't get the point of it all. I got the point of some of the parts but I didn't get the point of other parts .|0
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield , I can not claim to have enjoyed this movie as much. I found the ending unsatisfying and thought that it would be improved upon in the sequel. The other problem that the producers faced is the fact that Copperfield is written as a man with a past. This may have been an intentional decision, as it can be done in this day and age but in the movie, it is very difficult to sympathise with this man’s past. The other thing that bothered me is that the film has so few songs.|0
I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV . It 's the perfect example of how to get away with being an auteur and making sure you get the best of both worlds. With all the talk about blockbusters, with all the talk about what 's great about films and why it 's great, with all this talk about how great films really are, it's easy to get wrapped in all this hype about what makes movies good and what makes them really good. What's not to like? I'll give a little synopsis on this movie, though.|0
There 's a good story well hidden and never really used ! The film is short and overly dependent on the ending. There was a time in history where an army needed to take on a big enemy force, the story was simple, but it was a story that could never be told. The film is very long and never gets a complete ending because there is nothing to get out of the story. This was a great action movie based on an original story, but it failed because there was a long wait for any good ending.|0
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness . not only was it a masterpiece, but the story was really well told. the two main characters (the hero and his wife) both had great characters to them. It was so well made and well written that you wouldn't know you were watching it from the opening moments. It has a lot of things to say about marriage, faith, love, betrayal, friendship, loss, life, death - you name it - everything.|0
"People call a 976 ""party line"" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).Meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims."|1
As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film , I think that in the vast majority of cases, it appears that people do like the film. However, from the comments above, I’ve gathered enough information to say that I’m not sure that many people would want to see it, and in some cases, even dislike the film. It seems that there are a number of reasons as to why people dislike the film: 1) The acting is so bad.|0
OK , so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door . I open the door and I see a very nice woman , my mother !!! I just smiled and she was happy . When my mom went , she asked if I have something to eat . Then she smiled again . I started to smile , I told her that I'am having some breakfast when she told me the reason why she came back home . I told her that my grandma is coming from the city and she is going to see the place , she said that I am her favorite child.|0
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night . I 'm 20 years old and this movie was really cool . I was able to watch it from the beginning of the movie until like 30 minutes in , but I was a little curious about how the movie is written . So I started reading . There's a big part in the movie that was written in rhyme . The whole movie is about a young man who has to save the life of a young girl who is dying . One of my favorite parts is where it says that she had to be saved .|0
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp . The animation and voice acting were all done by the same person, and the story has no real plot or direction, but is just a story. The music was by the same guy. He does a great job, the background music is very soothing. The only bad part was the character design. He was a little too childish for his age, it was very distracting, and the voice acting was incredibly bad. It is hard to tell what are his real feelings, he says a lot of bad things.|0
I seen this movie when it came out . I thought what an average movie . I have now realized this movie is actually very good ! It's the best thriller I've seen so far . I like the ending, I like the way they make the people talk and think . I love how the movie is in a way like a real life . This is my favorite movie to watch . If you have any problem with nudity or sexual acts in this movie . Please let me know ! Thanks a lot for your attention and time .|0
The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt {I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt tricked. They trot out about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate.|1
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps to himself. He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes.|1
"I have for years remembered a song `` JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE '' ( `` No . twenty five years '') from a musical I did as an undergraduate, but was never able to locate it in any of my collections. I do remember that there is a picture of a castle in the background. Can you help me? I do remember the song. It's from the movie "" The Wizard of Oz "" I think. But, I have not heard of the movie or of the song. I have only the book. Can you help me?"|0
The movie with its single set , minimal cast , and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief appearances of a few familiar faces ) had a great cast and an interesting storyline. And the soundtrack , well, it was good , and it had a great score. But the acting was nothing special either and I wasn’t sure if it would work. I think we can all agree that it didn’t work. But the first time the movie was released on DVD , I was pretty impressed.|0
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexualsand I haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell.Yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place.|1
"The only reason I checked this film out was to see the ""early"" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a ""gripping suspense"", and it was three-star rated. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what has to be the ""disaster"" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. At one point, EVERYBODY is a suspect, including a frail old woman."|1
....is where I'm assuming this movie came from. I mean, I've watched plenty of B movies over the course of my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify this as a B movie. I remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.So the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight.|1
This is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography.|1
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches . Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the beginning of the movie that the only real problem the director was dealing with in the production of this piece of crap was the lack of any real talent. The only thing that really kept this film afloat through the first half of the production was some really good acting. I thought it would have done better had the actors been better acted, but if you are going to use stock characters to tell a story you need to use a good actor.|0
I 'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park 's Thirst is exceptionally well made , but spending over two hours playing it on repeat and getting sick is something that should be avoided. That 's the whole point though. I thought it was overrated. It 's an enjoyable puzzle game. It 's worth a look. That's what I call a masterpiece. The game is a well-made puzzle game. I have never seen such an ingenious game before in any game. It is a game I will be back and buy again and again.|0
Chop Shop , the second feature from Ramin Bahrani , is a rare breed . It is an American film that tells the story of a family in the ‘90’s who’ve been robbed and now they need to get back to where they’ve come from. Chop Shop has been described as a tale of revenge set in a noir world and the second feature from Bahrani is one of the most exciting films ever produced in America, a truly unique film with some great dialogue, direction, and some great performances .|0
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film . The direction just can’t capture the spirit or emotion of the story. The story is told in chronological order instead of chronological order within the book. Also the book ends right before the film begins. And of course the film ends after the book has ended. The book I chose as my film of choice for this blog is A Prayer for Owen Meany. I think it is one of the most important books ever written. I know many people have said this before, but I want to repeat it.|0
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. Clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, Matt is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture.|1
No blood , no sex ( though it oozes passion ) , no special effects , but just one of a kind. I’ve always been intrigued by the concept of “alternative” entertainment and what it can be, and I was lucky enough to be asked to create a film version of some of these stories. My original plan was to put all three of these tales into one movie, but we were able to change the order and focus them into separate stories to make the film flow better, so I’ll do that now.|0
A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help . To young to be on his own the cat has to find her own way back home and find the right way home for herself . The movie has lots of humor , but the humor is really all on the screen . It doesn't get too far in the beginning and then you get to see some real drama . . The story is set in Utah and it is obvious that this is all based on real people . One of the things I liked was the character of Bill and I thought he was very good .|0
Brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . Their alluring visual aesthetics and rich compositions make for a special cinema experience, but in a lot of cases they are not suitable for family viewing, or even watching on the tube. There are a number of reasons why these films aren’t suited for family viewing. One of the first reasons is the fact that these films are generally not shot on film. That is to say, they aren’t shot in a “natural” light.|0
"Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood's handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in ""Tarantula"" where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack."|1
"This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie ! This is the only Kung Fu movie ! This is the only Kung Fu movie that was made for the movies ! This is the movie that will change your life forever ! If you do a search for ""KUNG FU THE MOVIE"" on Google you will come across thousands of hits ! If you do not want to see Kung Fu movies anymore, stop reading this now ! Go and enjoy Kung Fu movies with your loved ones ! The movie will be a must see movie for all Kung Fu fans."|0
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ""gem."" This one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on VHS from an arcade on 42nd st. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. But, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse film. This film could replace water-boarding as a humane method of interrogation. No, I take that back - I would prefer water-boarding."|1
"I think ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most overrated horror film out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well-directed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like ""Gone With the Wind""!I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby Andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is)."|1
This film did not excite me. While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.One thing that I did not quite follow is how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.The other thing that I did not particularly like was the missing segment of Khan's life. It did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long.|1
"Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss Sergio Martino's gut-busting ""L'isola degli uomini pesce"" (called ""Screamers"" in the United States). Here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men."|1
This was my late wife's favorite film. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as I'm sure she would have worn it out. What can we say? A great romantic story and the push off of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow.|1
It pays to watch Reader 's Digest . Or Time , if it was the original source of the article. Of course, the only way to find that out was to google it , so I had to do both. I was so happy to see this in the paper that I almost didn't read it at first. Then I looked up his name and was delighted to see that I was right. This man has been my hero for the last 40 years or so. Now I understand why this man had a lot of trouble getting funding to do the work he did.|0
OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That's the case here.|1
The sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so I went to the movies , to get the sun out of the house , I went down stairs and I walked in , I walked to the bathroom and then to the living room . I opened the blinds , I opened the window a little and I turned on the TV , and the sound was not loud enough . I opened the living room curtains , but it was too dark out , so I put on the shades and I closed all the blinds and it was not very easy to open them again .|0
"i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. It was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom ""hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid"".Um. Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! It is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then."|1
"""Nicodemus"" is almost a copy of ""Red"" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it's way into Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects Jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however Clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is Lana."|1
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.Quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. I won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.The movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly.|1
Yes , I spelled that right . This movie is so predictable , the actual word needs additional letters to fit it . The first 3 minutes of the trailer did the movie a huge disservice . I was like , really ? I can’t understand half of this ?. I think I’ll wait till it comes out in theaters (the DVD is coming soon) to get the DVD and see what it’s all about . I think this film should’ve been shot in the first place , if it was , you can bet your ass , I would’ve seen it .|0
As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored.|1
I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. Justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. If you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early Americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...I highly recommend this movie. Especially during atime of war and conflict in Iraq...when our American image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out.|1
The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast.|1
"HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in ""The Big Green"". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Police Academy"", ""Cocoon""). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie."|1
Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this film? It is pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed for Yash Raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.This is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie I have ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do.|1
hello all Denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! This show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. Among Denver are other favourite too, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. It is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite.|1
Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films , and they do n't require a whole lot of preparation. In his early career (and in fact since the late 1930s), Keaton did a great deal of shorts. Many of these shorts, such as The Man from Uncle, were written for the films he was shooting at the time, as well as a handful that were created specifically for them. In these early films, Keaton had a bit more of a chance to be creative and he did a great job, often getting the material right.|0
This movie is on cable sporadically , and I never really watched it , thinking it would be similar to what I would have watched if I had paid for the DVD . I watched the first 2 episodes , and the 2nd one was a bit better , but it wasn't great . I then watched the 2nd 3 episodes and it was even better , and I felt like I saw the first movie and the 2nd movie in different ways . I then watched all the episodes again , thinking that the last one wasn't so good , thinking I had watched all 4 of the episodes , it wasn't at all .|0
the worst sequel I've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny.|1
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists . Sometimes , even without the 20/20 hindsight, one is inclined to think that it wasn’t a very good work, that it didn’t have much soul. But that is not always true. I recently had the chance to see a piece from an artist who is so much more than a painting. In fact , it was one of the greatest pieces of art ever made by a person who did not even have an art career. It was a series of portraits done by none other than Diego Rivera .|0
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. It's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death.|1
"I concur with the other users comment . Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it's such a classic movie . I also loved it and I always thought that I had a good time at the end . The best part was when she was saying "" I wish I was your daughter."" I always thought that she's a very cool girl and I wish that I have a girl like her in my life . I will never be like that . Even now , I still think that this is my favourite movie ."|0
i love watching the Jericho mile . i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt run it for all it's worth. i love his legs! i love them to death!!! i think we all agree that the mile is the hardest thing to run, i mean you're constantly on your knees and the pace is insane and the heat is just crazy. but we all agreed, the running community had the best Mile Mile marathon of all time. so of course i think i should win this race because i've been running it for so long.|0
"Now , I love bad , old skifee movies as much as most people . And I understand that a lot of my friends have a similar taste to me . So as soon as this movie was out on blu ray it was on my radar . If you want to see a movie on blu ray without feeling guilty about it . Here's my review of the new movie . What do you think about the new movie

I was very disappointed with the new movie . Nothing special , it’s a bad film with very poor acting , poor cinematography , and very basic editing ."|0
I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80 's . At first it sounded like a great idea . There was no mention of a bomb and it was just a toy. Now it's one of those things that would make you wonder if there's anything more to it than that . After I got my bomb, I was in high school and I knew I would be a little bit older than a few of my friends, so I really wanted to play with them. I was really excited when I found out that the bomb was available on the internet .|0
This movie was alright. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.Right away two French boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, along with that, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they're in Paris, the fashion capital of the world.|1
If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , ‘The Loneliest Man In The World,’ released in late April. The film is the first in what’s shaping up to be a huge franchise. Schrieber’s first feature is based on his memoirs, which chronicles his life as an author, photographer, actor, and film director, but has a unique twist. He also stars in the film, though he plays a different character from the one in the book.|0
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.|1
I absolutely adored this movie . For me , the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast this film is to the two sequels that followed it . The story was well told , the script was great , the cast was excellent and the acting was excellent . I really enjoyed this movie as much as I did the first time I watched it , and will definitely watch it again . The writing is great , especially the opening scenes . I don't know how else to describe it , it makes me want to weep . Then again I've already been crying a bit this time around .|0
i did n't hate this one . i just could n't adapt to the story . it did n't really make sense to me , as a whole . i guess that is just my way of being a fan , of books and movies . i just didn't get into this one . but i think it was fun to read . my only real complaint was with the ending , and i really wish it wasn't . Author's Response: Thank you for reading, I really loved this story. I wish I could say more about it and why I loved it.|0
***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. But then came the rest of the movie. By the time it was over I was furious. Nothing was correct but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden.|1
hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night? Can't find what your looking for? I thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie.|1
What can I say about a movie as bad as this? The people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in.|1
I have just started watching this show . Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTÉ1 and I am really looking forward to trying it. I found it on youtube and decided to download the tv-series for myself. In my research I found it difficult to get a grasp on what exactly this show is about. I could not figure out why someone would pay for the privilege of watching a program about sex. In the end I am still struggling with this issue and as I am writing I am starting to question myself.|0
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of games, a bit too slow and choppy. It’s also, as one would expect, one of the best shooters. But what it did lack was an element that most shooters of its ilk – FPS’es – so desperately need, namely the gamepad. Not just the old-fashioned analogue controller that allows you to steer and shoot the way you always have, but also more recent, more powerful gaming systems like the Xbox 360’s Game Pad and PlayStation Move.|0
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington , Ky last night . After a wonderful review of the film I went and saw it . I have to say my reaction was so much better than expected . I thought it was a comedy , but I guess it's a serious movie ! I don't have a review but I will try to give my opinion . It was well written and acted . The ending made me so sad . I wanted more than this ! I don't know what I can say to make the movie better .|0
When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book `` Het Gouden Ei '' /the beautiful child, he was delighted, but then he thought of his daughter and his wife. George Sluizer, the director, has directed a series of popular films in the Netherlands and Belgium and is a successful producer who has built up a following in these countries, especially for his children`s books. This is his second movie in Dutch and the first in Flanders, a dialect that is more akin to Dutch than to Dutch-Flemish.|0
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast , Ice-cream , I Scream is one of the poorest films of the period. It is a slow and monotonous film, the script is unambitious and the acting is so wooden, it can not even make up for this fact. It is a shame, because the story is quite interesting and it has a great character in the character of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the great leader of the Turkish Republic and the hero of the whole of this film.|0
The acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. The writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this???|1
"It's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even by that low standard this is a terrible film.Essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you're an ""Alan Smithee"" fan, avoid this one."|1
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli 's entry in Mick Garris ' Masters of Horror series of books. The book opens with a single scene, and we get a few lines, but then the book gets to its heart and then to its climax in the last few pages. Here we get a whole chapter of action, and in that chapter we get to learn the ins and outs of this character and his world. This is not your run of the mill novel, this is a real book that gets down to what makes that character interesting.|0
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).A haunting, intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From).The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.|1

I 'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie ! It seems that many of you enjoy the books as much as I do so I am not surprised that you are enjoying it as much as I do. I would say that if you enjoyed the book then you have to check out the movies, the series (if any) is worth watching. I'm sorry for not commenting lately, but my computer is still recovering from being broken. I had a couple of computer crashes today, and it is taking longer to get things back to normal.|0
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race , the members of a track team are stalked and killed. As one of the track team members prepares to go in to a hospital to be with his wife when he is kidnapped, he is shot by a man who has been stalking him, leaving the team member dead. In order to find out why his killer is killing his teammates and to find out if the killer wants to kill him, the team member must find out what the motive is behind the killer.|0
"My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. The movie ""Babas bilar"" must be just about the worst film I ever seen. I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper."|1
I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it.|1
The only reason i didn't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it...the only and i repeat the ONLY effect that they used is a weird kapoera (from India?) jump on a half meter wall/trash cans, i mean, effects doesn't make a movie but... sheesh.... me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used pharmacy's ..... and they found guns?!|1
"I love old ""monster movies"" for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird.The ""science"" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest."|1
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital ( TMC ) and was also working at Texas Children 's Hospital , Women 's Memorial Hospital , Children 's Memorial Hospital and the Children 's Cancer Center at Memorial Hermann Hospital when I took this job. After working for over two years at these hospitals as a doctor, I started to feel frustrated with some of the administrative tasks that I was asked to do . After working at the Houston Children's Hospital for over a year I noticed the work environment was much different and I became aware that some administrators were not doing their jobs.|0
I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to.|1
I was expecting a lot from this movie , and I can say I have n't been disappointed . First of all , it is very good in all the aspects , and I think that it is worth watching . But it was not so good that it affected the overall enjoyment . If I had one complaint about this movie I would just say that it was not good enough in one aspect , but all in all , I really liked this movie . I can't really put it into a specific category because it was a movie with good parts .|0
Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real.David Tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.But now Billie has left and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe).|1
Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest, the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history, one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal, as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair, our eyes are truly opened.|1
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though.This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film.|1
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger.|1
This appears to be two movies spliced into one . In the first , ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in the military, one of a small group of soldiers who escaped from the military in the late 1980's. In the second movie he becomes the military commander after being freed and taking a liking to the daughter of a man he saved from a car bomb in the first movie and being given the position he had originally been denied at the military. These two movies can be seen on the same DVD. The two are interspersed throughout this movie so it is difficult to tell which one is the movie.|0
I ca n't really criticize this film . It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and leading to a career I would be happy with if it had not happened. The cinematography is simply amazing and it's hard not to fall under its spell. The film takes some time for the story and the story is very good but it does not hold my attention very long. The best thing that comes from this film is that it is extremely well made. This is a good entry point for most of us and a good start for people interested in this film and its subject matter.|0
"oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry ""D"" student able to outsmart only stupid people."|1
"This movie has some good performances , as others have pointed out , but suffers ( as others have pointed out ) from a couple of weak points :

- The ending is rather predictable, but I’m guessing that the movie has something else going on in the last act. - It feels rather rushed , because it takes a bit of time for the story to unfold and you have to figure out the characters , and some of the action scenes, etc. Overall this is a very enjoyable movie , even if it does take a bit of time, but i’m glad I watched it."|0
Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's mildly amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. Whenever this comes on, I try to encourage my child to watch something else.|1
When this show began it was fairly interesting : we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through to make their crab. And then there was just a lot of luck. I didn't see many crab cakes. But that didn't stop the crab fishers from coming down to the docks to catch crab. It was a whole lot of fun. Now here's where it gets interesting. We get to go back in time to see what a crab boat was before that time. It was an interesting time. There were a lot of different boat types out there.|0
"The first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!For me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of ""different"" sailors- I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialog by heart. Kelsey Grammar with his ""God I LOVE this job!"|1
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel books. Counting this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i preferred greatly to this. It goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. I don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script.|1
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish , for a moment forget the famous 28 Days Later (which I also watched) It was a very interesting movie to watch, but I don’t think I got the full effect , I didn’t have the right frame of reference to compare it to the 28 Days Later, the film is very intense at first but I think after a while your attention will be drawn to what you see, it is also very dark and bleak, but I think the whole movie has a nice happy ending .|0
Maybe it 's just that it was made in 1997 , or maybe whoever managed to get this up to date in the first place. I would love to hear some of their other tunes, and I'd love to see this CD again.I would like to thank you for considering to post your comments, it's a pleasure and makes this site more enjoyable and useful.Please keep the site going. It has helped me a lot.And I hope to one day do the same for you. Thanks again! The first time I ever heard this song, it sounded very different from the one that later appeared on his second album.|0
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it . Something like : `` I like it but we have to wait for it to be finished because this is just a movie. `` That was the first time I got a hint that it was going to be a movie. There was also some debate whether this was a movie. It would have been better to keep the word `` movie `` as the title and to call this a movie that I would recommend to you because of its quality and the fact that it would be better.|0
Jess Franco makes exploitation films , and he has made tons of them . Franco is responsible for some of the greatest films of all time, like “Saving Private Ryan”, “Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,” or “Chronon”. In his short film, “Skiing in America,” Franco looks back at his life, and explores the themes of his career. He talks about how his life changed with each film that he made. He goes into detail about the different projects that he has worked on, and how they have influenced his career.|0
This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been out on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery (the movie, although taking place in and around Virginia, was filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie (including a boat that I've worked on).|1
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in many modern fiction novels, fantasy novels, and even more so in most science fiction novels, the idea of making fun of people's hobbies and/or favorite products in a non-judgmental and/or humorous way is a fairly common theme in the world of publishing. On the other side of the spectrum, the same may not be true in the real world, where it is extremely hard to get a book published that doesn't mention any company or brand in a non-offensive way.|0
"Man , I ca n't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . Okay , it sure is fun to look back and see all the good times with your best friend but I can't believe it was made by people that have no understanding of the "" culture "" of the 80's . This movie has it's flaws but I thought it was quite entertaining . Not to be a smart ass but this was the first movie I saw with my parents that made us laugh out loud a couple of times . Then I watched the movie with my parents and found it really funny ."|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art . This is an oblivious attempt to make a social commentary on the state of the world . I don’t know why Hollywood is trying to make a statement with this movie as it does not make any sort of point and does not portray a good or bad world . If anything this movie is very offensive to many of the people it tries to reach . It is interesting to note that the whole “social commentary” part seems to be a complete lie .|0
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. I just watched this film on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming film, with wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney then the film would be considered a classic, however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone, the film has slipped through the cracks.The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and was released through Paramount Pictures.|1
"********SPOILER ALERT************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this ""film"". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (Note, the scottish camp director...). ? And who does the shopping for the bog creatures?"|1
Honestly , this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting ( Heather Graham could never act in a real movie ), and if you are looking to be entertained by a great story and great acting, this is a must-see for you. A man goes from a small town on the East Coast to a city in a far distant country, where he works on a farm, and spends most of his time tending to livestock and dealing with his wife and family. This man takes the train out to New York , and then on a train from New York to San Francisco.|0
When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island , they soon find that their new home is anything but tranquil. On this island, a group of violent, cannibalistic natives are waiting for them, eager to feast on the new arrivals. When they arrive, the natives have built themselves a small temple dedicated to their deity, and have taken the new arrivals as their own - but they also have something else in mind for these strangers...they want them to be the first to sacrifice themselves on the island, so that they may be the ones to take over the island.|0
"Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. ""K2"" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing."|1
This movie was fabulous . It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film . The directing and camera shots are outstanding , the special effects are top notch , the action scenes are all well choreographed and shot well . And the songs are all catchy and great to listen to . If your not into hitchcock, then you can enjoy it , if you do, it is highly recommended to see the movie for sure . But , it is still good to make it on to your Dvd player so you can listen to it , if you want . It was a really good flick.|0
This movie surprised me . The box is misleading , the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film is misleading. I've been a fan of horror for a long time and this movie was not scary. I was expecting it to be, but not sure how that works. The movie is not scary at all, and that's why I think the movie should have been called House of the Rising Sun, as scary as it is, the movie is just one of the many horror movies released this year. I don't think the horror genre has a future.|0
I hope this is n't a portent of things to come . High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time. The only way to save money in the future is to buy and use an adapter. I can't believe how much video quality these cameras have gotten since Apple started the MacOS X development, I've only used a handful. I've seen a $20 card for an $80 or $100 video camera. I thought it would take months to get a good adapter. It makes me so sad. Click to expand... I don't use my camcorders for video.|0
"There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. ""Meatballs"" was a leader. And here's one of its followers. ""Party Camp"" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that ""Meatballs"" (the original) had so successfully mined. Of course, that one had Bill Murray. So, what does ""Party Camp"" have?I'm glad you asked that question.Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish SHE provides!"|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. However, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film. One well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing.|1
This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much.|1
This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in . Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera he’s a better actor and has a better acting style than Bullock. Bullock was the best choice because Bullock does not know how to shoot a movie . I would like to see Sandra Bullock become a movie star and be able to create her own movies . Bullock has been doing a lot of “acting” and she has the talent to do so. She needs to go back to school and continue to work . Bullock has the talent for a few movies.|0
When the word `` presents '' finds its way into a title , preceded by a famous name , the title will say something about this person , or the title will describe something of interest . The title is also important in describing a person , such as when a person , such as a movie star , is referred to . Some people use a number of titles for similar things . For example , a person may have several initials in the same name . It may be used to distinguish one person from others in the same group .|0
"Yes, why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's ""Psycho"" however, gives me pause. Why? I wonder."|1
"This is an interesting movie. I think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy ""self-portrait"" of an artist (""I make horror films. If I would make love films, no-one would buy tickets...""). And it's really SEXY movie also: Almost all the time there is some ""action"" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place..."|1
If ( as I just pointed out in THE GOAT ) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding out the truth , and telling the whole truth , and not leaving things up to conjecture , or guesses . I don’t think he would be so hesitant , or hesitant to reveal it if he is doing it honestly . That’s a pretty big question mark, and I’m not qualified enough to say if I’m going to have faith in him being honest about his feelings and thoughts . That’s a different topic .|0
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse.|1
The finest short I 've ever seen . Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened , due to the fact that this is a very good film . But to me , it's more like a longer 'A Man Escaped A Prison And The Man Who Killed Him' . I don't think this film is meant to have been lengthened in any way . All I know is , it's very good . It's a film I would like to watch again . I 'd recommend it , but I would never recommend it to a young child .|0
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago . I always thought it was the best book I ever read. And to think I thought it was only for young children. But the truth is there is plenty of information here, which I always thought would be too scary and too intense for my kids. And now I have a very happy daughter who knows I'm trying to help her with this book. So, I decided to give this book to my daughter after I started reading it.|0
`` Disappointing '' is the best word I could think for this film , especially considering the glowing reviews it's been getting since it was first announced. Not that you really need to tell me that. Just get over it. This is not a film I would go out of my way to see. It is, however, one that you have absolutely no business going out of your way to watch. It's got a great premise and some very entertaining scenes, but for me at least it has no real reason to be on your radar screen.|0
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated.|1
"(Contains spoilers)People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the ""Mississippi"", but - Catherine Deneuve."|1
I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are n't stories , but the way he tried to explain that to me is beyond ridiculous. I'd rather people stop talking to me and walk away from this thread. I've heard it before and I've seen the videos of it and it's nothing like this I've seen and I have no doubt there is nothing to be gained here, but I can't help but look down the road a little to see what could be done to keep the conversation going. And no, this thread wasn't for me.|0
Well , this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version into account. But for the first 30 or so minutes and a good bit of the first hour, there seemed to be more of a plot than a story. I didn't mind it at all when I first watched the DVD, but after the first hour, I was annoyed. I mean, how do you make a sequel to a movie that has already been remade and remade? And how did the producers do that? They should have let me in on the secret.|0
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque.|1
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow. I would not think about going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn french anyhow because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I rather go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language just like me. Therefore I will not bother the France trip no matter what.|1
I like Arnold , and I love the subject matter , but this was a very disappointing movie . When I got to see it a few years ago , it did not grab me so much as I expected , and in fact , it seemed a bit tamer . Now , that was not the case . I felt a bit bored , a tad bored to tears with it , but bored to tears . The plot was interesting and I enjoyed the way it was constructed , but I could never find myself getting excited about any of it .|0
I can't believe I sat through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUPPOSED to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't. The only saving grace is that it was on cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.|1
"I like ""Hack."" Think the ""Lone Ranger"" reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver, a decent but flawed guy, in Philadelphia doing his best, while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past, and you've got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding ""Silver"" in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly, without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average."|1
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can . Add more plot holes than plot . Have it all planned in the first place . Then it turns into a horror film that ends with you dead. That’s right, horror film. No matter how ridiculous a plot might seem, if you’re planning your next horror film, make sure it doesn’t actually have to happen in this world. Otherwise, you’ll end up with a movie which you’ve had your fingers on the trigger too many times.|0
Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham.|1
"OK, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" and expect it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance."|1
"my girlfriend , as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square , after the movie , says ” it’s so boring” , i reply, ” it’s true” . she says ” it’s so hard to be happy i’d rather die”
then we both look at the street lights , and i say , ” are they on ? ” we look to the sky with the cold wind coming from our coats , but we see nothing , just darkness , and i ask , ” did you see them ?” she says , ” yes” ."|0
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning . Motion pictures are works of art . Films are a means to an end. But, there are exceptions to this rule. Films have their place in our minds, but only as an end in and of themselves. It is not the medium, but the viewer, who makes the work of art. When watching movies you are the viewer, who watches a story unfold. If you don’t pay attention to the story then you are missing a part of what you are watching.|0
"I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful ! Awfully long - even though they managed to make it a pretty enjoyable movie. This movie has a lot of interesting parts and the whole thing just comes together to leave you thinking: ""huh, this sounds like it's made by a very intelligent person and a great director."" But the rest of what is in the film doesn't even make sense. The film's director and the actor playing the lead both have mental problems. Also, why are they both acting as if nothing ever happens?"|0
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you.|1
Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . This is simply a `` run of the mill story , not something I have ever read . A lot of what is in it I have already seen , so I don't know how much I can take on . The plot is interesting and interesting in itself , as it is not at all what I would call typical , and it doesn't feel like a sequel to a story that was already made . The story moves at a brisk pace and it is well done and well written , with all the elements you expect from a thriller .|0
Bad, bad, and did I mention bad? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT director!The only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on Clara Bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the Bone Eater rides on.|1
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy.|1
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. There are a few moments in this film that are brilliant, the story is very well told and the acting is solid and well acted. This is an excellent film for adults. A great film with a very strong message about the power of forgiveness and the importance of being patient and kind with everyone. I found myself laughing out loud during many scenes and this is no doubt because of how the film was told.|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection.|1
"After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it , oh the joy of an early computer screen. I’m sitting on the couch, typing this. It’s my third time typing this paragraph. And my third time doing so in the same place: in the same space. This place:

I feel like I’ve been in this room before. And yet, I can’t think of the name of it. It’s the room I came in that night, before I’d left my room."|0
Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick 's Clockwork Orange there was of course `` no question about it '' being a masterpiece, but the question is whether this masterpiece can be found in the same sense in the movies. When I say that the story has been re-told countless times in the course of movie history I mean that literally, not metaphorically in the case of the story that was the first ever made. The story was first presented to the cinema in a storyboard by a Hollywood art director that was cut together and then the movie was re-shot using that cut as the basis of the re-shot version of the tale.|0
Loki , Norse god of mischief , creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers . At the end of this story, Loki's disguise is so much more than just a disguise. In this story I have decided to introduce Loki. Loki has a secret. He is a real Norse god. He has many masks , and I'm going to show you the masks that Loki has. I'm not going to show you all the details of how they work, or how they work together. This is an introductory story to Loki that I will be talking about in more detail.|0
WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on giving this film a watch, I have no idea what the heck it is going to get. You can go and see it if you want, but just know that I am in no way responsible for your viewing choices.You're going to have to take what you get! I would have to agree with you one hundred percent. It is not as bad as most reviews claim, and I do not think I have seen any of the many horrible reviews.|0
"Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend "" Uncle"" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas."|1
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or what have you. There was none, and I left with a sense of relief, because at least the film had been as good as advertised. So I'm not going to say it's bad (I don't believe any director can say it's a masterpiece) nor am I going to say it's bad, but you should probably check it out before you decide to see it on a Friday night or something.|0
First off , I never got into Dr. Who until recently . Honestly , I never got the opportunity to watch the show before , and the only reason I am still watching it is because I got into it , I was introduced to the series by the late great Steven Moffat , and since I love Moffat I have to continue watching it and see if I will ever grow to love it the same way. So let's just jump into this and go into what it is about. Dr. Who is a science fiction series about a British police officer on the run with a secret identity.|0
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek , quiet , but very large gardener who lives in a mansion. Then the wolfman takes a liking to the gardener, and begins transforming her into a wolflike beast. The gardener then becomes a victim of the wolfman's crimes. Gardener's tale is similar in many ways to that of the story in The Monster Within. The gardener was the first to be transformed into a monster. The gardener is the only character who remains in the story. The story begins when a young boy is attacked by his pet wolf and killed by it.|0
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale ( a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik ) goes to work at an unnamed hospital under the supervision of Dr. Richard Dreyfus (a splendid Richard Gere) but quickly discovers that she is dealing with a whole lot of people, not only those she is supposed to be working with but many of them, not only nurses, doctors, scientists, and researchers but patients as well, all trying to escape from their lives, and all of whom are trying to get back at her for putting them down when she left their care behind.|0
The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment , which was ( thank God ) the last one to show some real progress. At least we had a good finale to last year’s series finale . The second half of Season 6, though, is a disaster of a third episode, one that seems to take itself very seriously indeed. And it’s not just a matter of pacing , as I’ve said above . There are too many cliche moments that are so obvious that the audience will know they’re cliche before they see any real development.|0
"The reason why this movie sucks , have these people even read a bible ? Everything in the movie was a lie, just like every other film made by the same company . The only reason they think they will get a lot of hits from it , is because people are too dumb to know what is going on lol

I know that I read the Bible and watch it, so why would I want to watch it when I am already so close to the truth? It is true that the Bible says God created the world. I have read it and know that God exists."|0
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making , it 's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If the title of this film had been any other word, then you would be right to feel frustrated, but I really can't recommend this film. It's nothing more than a boring, pointless exercise for the entertainment of people who don't like films - or even films with any entertainment value at all. It only succeeds at making you feel bored and exhausted after an hour or so of watching it, which is all it ever does.|0
Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways . The real-life story that inspired the film isn't a surprise for anyone familiar with the movie, but the way in which it was filmed is . In the film, a man (Robert De Niro), who was shot and murdered by the Ku Klux Klan as he rode through town on his horse in 1957 in a show of hate and violence. The film follows the actual events of the shooting as well as its aftermath.|0
As I looked at this movie once again , I think it belongs among Hitchcock 's greatest films . The camera is a lot of fun to play . And it has a lot to say ! I don’t know about you guys , but I love the whole idea of Hitchcock movies , with their Hitchcock style . So I thought this was an excellent movie for the movie club. And after all , it was one of the only Hitchcock movies that I have seen , so I thought a lot . First off , let me start by saying that the first half of the movie is very well done .|0
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie. However, not more than 5 minutes later, I was already gouging my eyes out. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. The one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. However, I didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I guess anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie?|1
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995, I dismissed it offhand, saying that Julie was no Daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid.But here it is, 5 years later, its on Disney and im watching it again. And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as I made it out to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever. And Swank's character isnt that bad, her acting is pretty good considering the script.|1
In short this movie was awful.I understand it's a Disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. HOWEVER, i must say this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store.|1
This was a very good PPV , but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later , the WWE crammed so much into a single night that it was nearly impossible to make sense of it. That said, this is a very good review, I found it very interesting, informative and entertaining. This is the first full article I have ever written covering a PPV . This is my first article since I am currently working as a technical writer for WWE Network . In addition to writing my own WWE Network articles I will be contributing to WWE Network by providing the reviews for those PPV's that I write the review of.|0
If you 're a fan of the original series , do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the beginning when I thought the movie was just a made up trailer. There was no story to this movie. The only story is this movie. The movie is just like the original cartoon. It's pretty clear in the beginning that the movie is going to turn into one big action sequence. If you like action then you should probably see the movie in theaters, but it's just not worth it to me if you do not watch this movie and you have nothing else to complain about.|0
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. The locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. It just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. Only in the Mediterranean I guess. Certainly in no world I am familiar with. The macho men were really obnoxious, and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long.|1
Two years after this short , the last `` Our Gang '' short was made . After seeing this , I don't understand why the studio made this one. There is only one possible explanation . One year after the last film , the studio decided to make the final `` Our Gang ''' movie . This movie has no plot or character development , but is really just an extended , one of the longest running . This is a sequel to the first film . I'm pretty sure , it is the same story about the gang being called back to the town .|0
Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology.|1
I'm sorry but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked big-time. How in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews.|1
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight.|1
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. It started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. As they found dead bodies, or should I say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? At times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert.|1
They call this film `` euro trash horror '' . Well , it 's not horror . The film takes place in euro countries like Greece , Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria where the average life expectancy is just 32 years. But here in Italy , where a healthy average life span of 69.2 years is the reality. The main story is told by two young girls from two small towns in northern Italy , as they are kidnapped in a remote area of the Italian Alps. They are found in a remote place and are taken captive to a very strange town where they are sold to a strange family.|0
The reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about moses, God was staying out of it. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also the people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it, It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again.|1
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for ME. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly) .|1
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream : Do nothing , be a loser and enjoy yourself . Oh yes , being a loser doesn’t make it any better , but at least we can laugh. What’s the big deal with this guy, he can’t find a decent job, he doesn’t know what the hell his boss is doing and all he’s got to do is sit around on his little ass and think of how great he can be. He can’t be a CEO and not work as an engineer , that would suck.|0
Let me tell you something ... this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as well as those two. It was a very funny and very funny horror comedy. It has a lot of gore and it's like the Troma of horror movies ... it doesn't have a moral ... it just has to be laughed at in that manner ... It's not a horror movie where you cry out and then go to the gas chamber or whatever ... it's funny. And it's not just a horror movie about a guy going to the gas chamber.|0
BIG FAT LIAR , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . When you watch the movie you get to think about what you should do and how you should respond . There are scenes in the movie that you would be amazed to learn is not based on a reality . The movie takes you into the life of a con artist , he is not a rich or famous man . He is poor , homeless , dirty , addicted to the drug . His main motivation is not money , it is his love . So what is his response ?|0
So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc.|1
I realise it 's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie ( which was grandiosely directed by Richard Donner) in a contemporary world, so I want to try a little different approach and see if I can live up to other movies made in a much earlier time. What I would like to see is some kind of a The Ten Commandments for the 21st century, maybe something that's less offensive than The First Ten Commandments, but still with some more religious references, and maybe a slightly older one as well.|0
"I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (""I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!)."|1
`` Ghost Son '' is Lamberto Bava 's best film and , at the same time , also his worst film, so you can really imagine that it must have been a very difficult experience to make the film. In the beginning , the story moves along very well. There are a bunch of funny, but also some very tragic moments that you will be glad to hear about later in the course of the film. But, for the first half , it's all very predictable and tedious, and this is not something you expect from a Bava film, but I think its a very good choice.|0
I watched this movie last night , i 'm a huge fan of the book , and i was pretty amazed how the story line worked out. It's one of the most entertaining movies i 'm aware of. The story follows the life of two guys , one of whom is a former gangster , and the other is a teacher who goes through a terrible tragedy. One of the best parts of this movie is the friendship of these two characters. I didn't get to see it in the theater, but there were a bunch of clips on youtube that were pretty funny.|0
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap . This anti-Bush propaganda is the worst thing I’ve seen in my life. We’ve been hearing about the ‘War on Terror” for the past couple of weeks, but now Bush and his friends are planning a new war with Iran . They have to be kidding, right? I’ve never understood the fascination with Iran . I know a lot of Americans love Saddam, but he doesn’t kill anyone.|0
"I usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain.I don't usually watch sequels but I just had to see this since I love ""Rosemary's Baby"" so much. What a mistake that was. It simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. In fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be."|1
There 's only 2 reasons I watch this show ... I invested the time already in previous episodes and Colleen did not do a disservice to her fans. I have no problem with watching this show, but this show has to be re-watched every 2-3 years or the episodes become dated, especially the last few. My point was that a lot of people are complaining that they don't like these new episodes because it doesn't match the rest of the season, they didn't like them when they came out in the first place either.|0
I am so excited that Greek is back ! This season looks really eventful . Im glad that Casey is back in training and so excited about her. She has had a really tough season but her attitude has been so positive and her attitude has motivated the younger girls. I have always felt she has been in the back of my mind but I am glad that I can now see what is going on with her from the other side ! She is such a special girl ! She has had so many obstacles to overcome over the last 6 years but she is back and has really come out of it .|0
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget.|1
"Look, this film is terrible... the ""plot"" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. Eventually the kids engineer ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny."|1
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious , I found it well worth watching . The performances by the various cast members in the film are very good , but one of the best performances is the acting of the child , who really brings all the tension in the movie and makes it very believable , even when you don't understand what he's saying . The movie is well worth watching . This movie is not the most interesting movie I've seen , but it does have one really interesting plot line that I think is worth mentioning .|0
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me . Everything I hate about films is in it. The characters are not real people. The acting is atrocious. The characters are supposed to be evil. But the film makes me want to be evil. It’s such a terrible piece of shit. I don’t know why it makes me want to be evil. It makes me want to kill everyone so they don’t have anything to worry about, like I think it’s supposed to do.|0
"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called ""Big Fat Liar"". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie!"|1
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say awful? The script was so weak, using cliche after cliche. It seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on Enron. Watching the movie, we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book this bad? I don't know what to say. Just terrible.|1
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film. After years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. The kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.Interestingly, it turns out that Mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college.|1
"The director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: ""Amélie"" meets ""Breaking the waves"" meets ""Pauline at the beach"". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold."|1
"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is , perhaps , not understandable for the `` rest of the world"" . . . The film `` is the last in a trilogy which begins with the first film . . . a movie that is quite difficult to understand for the `` rest of world"" . . . for Wajda himself . . . as a director , one must be very careful to not make some statements that are not true ( and that are not well thought out , too ) . Wajda does not have such a problem ; he thinks the film should be easy for us to understand ."|0
The Mummy's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one. Kharis and his mate Ananka both end up in the bayous of Louisiana, and on his resurrection, he searches out his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana isn't made entirely clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders.The Mummy's Curse was watchable, but it really wasn't anything special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I'd seen this before.|1
"This movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all ""gringos"" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. All that is outside one's country's border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else."|1
Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. Actually it sort of stinks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. Characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good.|1
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of rare animals. And then one of the animals they find turns out to be a bit of a monster, and a bit of an animal. And what happens when this creature turns out to be an animal. And then a bit of a creature, which is something else. Now this creature has a few things going for it, including a really big head and big muscles. But then it doesn't take too long to realize that it needs to eat something to survive.|0
this really is an `` okay '' series .. everyone in it is pretty good . but i just ca nn't stand watching them . maybe when i get older i'll re-watch all the episodes and see if i like it better or not but for now, i won't bother because it's just a really silly, forgettable and over rated series that has no point and doesn't appeal to me in the least . maybe if they made a good sequel to it i'll rewatch it. . i just have to agree that it doesn't matter who wins, it's the outcome that's important.|0
Yes , indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie ! The only reason I chose to vote for it as the worst film ever is because it's the least smart-action-film I have ever seen ( and yes , I've seen more ) , but even then , the acting , writing and special effects weren't that great . I have seen plenty of stupid action-movies and I can say I have never seen any that are this dumb ( even if it was a dumb film ) and I am not impressed with it ! The worst thing about this movie is that its just all stupid and stupid-acting and stupid dialogue .|0
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about the most beautiful movie ever. The first time I viewed it I thought it was a very dull and predictable movie...and I mean very predictable in the sense that the plot did not surprise me. However, after seeing it again I must say that it has become a much more pleasant film. And, it has taken me to a totally new level. If you want to see it, go ahead, I don't mind if you do!|0
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them."|1
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money, she becomes Brown's property.|1
It 's schmaltzy , but then what else did you expect ? The heroine is Cinderella 's younger sister complete with a little sister. I think it's a cool concept that she's just a girl who's in a house full of men. Also, as a bonus, you can hear a bit of an evil laugh. That is such an interesting idea, I wonder if you guys would make a video game based on it or if we would do the same. I've seen a bunch of these in action before.|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is a return to form ? Are they expecting to be dazzled by an innovative film ? They’d be right as there are times when Al Adamson’s films are spectacular and it should be on everyone’s watchlist ! I don’t think this was the intention of Adamson’s films, but that is what they are. I have a feeling he has been waiting a long time to get a film made that he could make in the manner that he originally wanted to.|0
Steven Seagal is back ! Here with his third film released this year . Of course as a one time action star he is best known by his last film 'A Good Day to Die Hard' and his most recent films 'Die Hard' (2013) and 'Die Harder' (2014) , but he is now a director, he has just started shooting for his third film 'Sicario', a film which is based on the events in his last two movies. Now he is back with another action packed thriller. 'Sicario' is released in theatres today.|0
This movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. To go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing.|1
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. This is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts.|1
I wo n't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season , but then , things have gone out of balance in a few aspects of the show . I have come to realize that while the show has great potential , it needs to be seen in its entirety before we can really make up for lost time . So , I need to give you a synopsis of how the show has come to be . I started off by saying that the writing is really good and the show is very engaging .|0
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget , arthouse movies . I also know that John Sayles has been successful in writing these types of films . He's produced a handful of films that have gotten high marks . There's just something about a classic American movie that seems to have no expectations and is just a treat to watch . There were many years where I felt disappointed when a film did not meet the standards I had always thought it should . It's easy to say you don't expect a film to be a classic , but this one did just that .|0
This movie made me so angry!! Here I am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. The scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must I go on? There are porno movies out with better dialog than this. I understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. This is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning.|1
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.|1
"Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the ""mentor"" and the ""talented immature pupil"". The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate."|1
2005 was one of the best year for movies. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence.....Coming up we also got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong....But if this year the only great movie that came out was Everything Is Illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. The first movie as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles.|1
"This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible "" Sarah`s law "" following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud ."|1
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few . Let’s break them down and look at them one at a time…

1. “The End of Innocence” doesn’t make you laugh. The only “fun” of this movie is watching it make you physically ill from laughing so hard. No wonder it’s a film so bad. The entire first half is filled with people trying to laugh out of sheer terror. A few people even laugh, but the rest of the film is filled with gags and laugh-worthy scenes."|0
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion . What makes this film so unsettling is that the characters do not follow a script but react and react, in their own way as they fight, their lives are torn apart and they can no longer see their daughter. It is such a powerful film and is so well acted that the audience can only react to it with laughter and tears. One of the most emotionally charged movies in recent memory and a very good film in the best way, not a bad film as some would have it!|0
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited, roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it is Disney, you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer.|1
Christopher Nolan 's directorial debut is a memorable one . The film was very well received and help land contracts for several directors to direct big studio films for the past decade or so. That’s not quite true, but that was the point. As a writer, director, producer and executive in the film business for the last decade, I have seen the business evolve to become more “mega studio” than “small.” While this was good news for most, not all, a number of people were disappointed by the direction Nolan took with his directorial debut.|0
This movie was painfully awful. Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods, walking thru the woods, or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two kids who discover two 'horribly mutilated bodies' in the woods, return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really really night, its dusk, its pitch black, its day. All the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind.|1
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it . I comment here , however , because it is a very interesting film , it is not at all what I would call a commercial product , it is a little bit of a film for sure . However , I do like the music . The story line is quite interesting as well . I’m glad to see this movie is available again , I watched it in theaters a couple of years ago and was disappointed to see it go out of print , so I was happy to see another one of my favorites back in theaters .|0
Seriously , Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies . They 're all horrible . And this one had John Rhys-Davies as the main bad guy , the only good guy he saw in his life . And to think , after this movie , I won't be watching more TV shows on the History Channel . Oh well , it was fun watching this movie . The plot line was fine , the story was entertaining . No one had to go through the death throes , the heart attack . The whole thing was done with aplomb .|0
"Perhaps I missed something , but I found GOYA 'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama . As to the ending , it doesn 't have an 'EVERYBODY dies' kind of feeling , which is good , and it gives us a hint of how many more movies are in the coming years that will probably have this ending , but for now I'll have to say this :

As you may know, this is the first film to be set in the same universe that we all know and love, so it will probably be an uphill struggle to adapt this film to other universes."|0
"David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. ""eXistenZ"" is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game."|1
"OK,I've seen over 100 Troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" was horrible, and ""I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist"" was unwatchable, but this is THE WORST FILM IN THE TROMA LIBRARY!A bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.This is really terrible. Even as exploitation films go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs."|1
What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot.|1
Well, I fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but I literally just watched it- during a PBS membership drive- and frankly I'm too excited NOT to say anything. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety.|1
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son.|1
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling.|1
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the Old West. Except it's not the real Old West, of course. It's some sort of Future West, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them.So, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies.|1
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me . The test that postal workers undergo is far beyond their capacity to deal with an incident that will affect millions of people. For example , the postal inspector should have had the same type of security camera in the van as he would have had in his office building. I know many postal employees. I am not sure how many have had this happen to them. This guy got hired to be a post office truck driver who would haul packages. What a waste . What is wrong with this world?|0

Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Source's personal assassin, Shax. Whilst Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper, and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done.|1
After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon , I could n't quite figure out why so many people seemed to be so upset over it. For one, you don't like it. For another, people don't like it. I don't know if I like it, but I've seen it and I liked it so I'm not that upset over it. I don't get why people are so upset over it, but it's an easy movie to get past. Personally, I think it's funny. It's not the greatest, but it's not terrible either.|0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today . Horribly predictable , obscene usage of racial and ethnic slurs to describe people who aren't white , a blatant attempt to blame anyone who doesn't live in America or live in the South for their own race - all to perpetuate white supremacist policies and racism . There is nothing to laugh about about this show. Even though I don't particularly enjoy this kind of material, I am somewhat amused by all the racial and ethnic epithets and slurs used by the main cast.|0
I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. The cast was made of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. The story line is great too. The thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea.|1
Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of television. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. I really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot.|1
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration.|1
"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love."|1
"This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it's over you'll wish there were more. Well-written and compelling, this movie draws you in and holds on tight. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the performances outstanding. ""Nanny"" is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong, forgiving, protective, and never judgmental. ""Nanny"", to me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community."|1
I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of `` Grand Champion '' and I got to sit in on all the interviews. I loved it. You know how I talk in interviews and say, `` That’s why I’m on the set and not the set. It’s such a cool thing to see. It’s nice to get to see them live and hear them, but the best part was the people we got to interview. A couple of the guys that were in that show, it was fun to see them and hear from them.|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie. The only problem is it isn't very well done.My brain is still insulted from the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala The Weather Channels commercials. Why would watching local news footage of a washed out side-street give insight to global weather patterns? You got me.Also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man.|1
OK , so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid . However , I think there are two things I didn't realize until I watched the second Karate Kid : 1) It's NOT as easy as you would think. I've never really been a fan of the one on one stuff in martial arts , and I've always felt like it could be easier and better , but I just thought that this one was really good. 2) What's that saying , the one thing you always do , and you'll never do again .|0
"This is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. It uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of Creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called ""horror"" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. There is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well.."|1
Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation , which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life when he first came into conflict with his religious beliefs. This is a wonderful, well-made documentary that brings us into the life of a young scientist. The actors are delightful and the narration is superb as Darwin struggles with his beliefs. In many ways it's as much a study of a scientist and of the struggles he must face in order to become a Christian as it is a fascinating glimpse into the past and future of evolution.|0
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going our own way (we used to have to go all the way to the other end of town). They would all gather around the tv and chat. We would get up and get out and dance and have a great laugh. And then on Monday we’d all go out for a game of cards. The other guys would usually end up winning the most but we’d all laugh and be together.|0
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example: When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain, I was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it. Nothing! Are you kidding me? A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations. Overall, small children will enjoy this, parents will endure it without too much complaining.|1
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows himself up. The movie is a pretty decent film, though it did not do much to put a positive slant on the IRA campaign. Rourke was born in Northern Ireland , but was brought up and raised in the USA, and now lives in Northern Ireland and England. The movie does not take place in Northern Ireland, so this movie is not very useful. It is about Rourke living in Northern Ireland.|0
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes back to in his films, even though that’s not what it's really about at all. It may be a bit of the story of life in the 18th century that he depicts in the book, but not the story that I think he meant to depict in the movie. He does this in his books because he is trying to find a way to depict life as it would have been lived in his time.|0
This movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning Minnie Driver's character. I think that all too often Hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too.|1
"""Hoppity Goes to Town"" was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's films are well remembered today, both of the Fleischer films ""Gulliver's Travels"" and this one are forgotten. ""Hoppity"" is a spellbinding original, not an adaptation like the first picture. That is a major plus, one would think. No, the critics, rarely on the Fleischers' sides to begin with, tore into them for this."|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts.|1
This series is formulaic and boring . The episodes are the same thing every week , simply with slightly varied plot lines . This will make things very confusing and a bit frustrating . The best thing they could have done to make things simple would have been to have two episodes where the story takes place in the same place . A lot of the stories could be condensed in a way that doesn't have the same issues . For the story of the first episode , there would have been 3 episodes, each with 2 episodes , the first being the main one and the next two being some filler episodes .|0
i did not expect to enjoy this . in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew about it and i was in the mood for a horror film, but i could have done without it and would still watch it if my friend wasnt going to go see it, which he would have. i wouldnt say it is bad but it is a very, very different kind of horror that i would prefer if it was available on dvd, and not available for purchase online, or if you wanted to pay for it, rather then just getting it as a film.|0
"Although I was hoping that I 'd like it a little more , this was still certainly an impressive film . if there is any hope of a second chance , 
I would have liked to have seen more about the film , 
especially its relationship with the characters in it . although I didn't notice any problem with the actors , 
i did think that i 'd prefer a bit more dialogue in some places . it seems that it was quite a difficult film to play with . it was one of those films that 's hard to like and hard to forget ."|0
I think `` category 6 : day of destruction '' was very unrealistic . The digital effects where like a day is a day . A lot of games don't really take place during the day. It's not realistic. But this was an interesting way to play, and I'm glad my kids played it and liked it. That being said, I personally don't see myself as being able to enjoy this game anymore because of the way it played. But I will probably be able to play the game one more time, and with better graphics.|0
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road...|1
"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990."|1
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old . I remember loving it but didn’t understand much about it . It was a strange movie . There were a couple scenes that seemed a little too dark for my little mind . But I really enjoyed it . It was about a little girl . She was a very shy child with no mother , father , friends , sisters , brother . I remember seeing her play in the street . I don’t remember exactly , but I just saw her playing with her little sister .|0
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I have n't seen or from her early movie career is a must

I'm interested to know the names of any of the Hepburn's that you've seen from the movies. I was a teenager in the 1950s or early 1960s, and I saw her in some of her roles as a child actress. I guess I saw her only in a couple of TV shows. I don't think I knew her until I was an adult. I've never had the chance to go to a movie."|0
I love cheesy horror movies , I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party was a great movie too! I think slumber party was the greatest slumber party film ever. And I am very very very sad I have not seen it at the theater yet! But I do like it very much! One of my all time favourite horror films, a must for any fan. Even if you don't like slumber party! I've watched it a couple of times and it's always been great.|0
"OK, it was a ""risky"" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to ""Bloodsurf"", the worst ""horrormovie"" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it."|1
"Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS . Was heavily re-used with the exception of ""Pillars Of The Sun"" which I saw only once. I can only speak for my personal tastes. I liked the show better when it was shorter and less involved in the plot. I've only had one show that I watched twice on DVD. I didn't like it, but it had a definite style that appealed to me. But I don't know that there's much more to say about it."|0
"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the ""Fat Guys At the Movies."" The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen."|1
I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper, and Phoebe try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with Piper.|1
"Jerk hazer Mike ( David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die). Bitch

This is what it looks like. The guy on the far right has no head, as if he had one, and is wearing an eyepatch. (The guy on the other end of the frame, the one wearing glasses, seems to be the same guy as the other guy on the right, but his head and glasses have changed, so it's unclear which is which. We'll assume it's one guy because of the glasses and eyepatch.)"|0
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to.|1
`` You can survive anything '' . Anything except a dumb horror flick . The director could n't even decide to shoot the movie in high definition because that would've been a disaster . I had to watch '' The Mist before I could watch '' The Conjuring'' . I've been on the fence for most of the movie . It is very well written . I am very impressed with both of these films . ''The Conjuring'' will scare you to the core . I'd recommend anyone to watch this film . It has all the ingredients that are needed .|0
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing . All the acting was very well done and the story was entertaining and well written. The plot was well thought out. I'm not very knowledgeable of this kind of thing, so I would have to call it a mixed bag. Definitely worth a try, though, if you're a fan of this kind of stuff. There's something to be said for being realistic about your life when writing fiction. This film is pretty darn good, even if it isn't exactly a good film.|0
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.Turd.|1
Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking at you! Sony's got the rights to Harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! Anyhow, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully underknown, full of great stories, greater music, and it could have been 3 hours longer and I'd have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, where it played to a packed house. They were turning people away at the door!|1
"Down Periscope is not a ""Great Movie"". But then again very few flicks are. So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a ""great movie"", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must take on the entire US-navy with it's nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome."|1
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career .... As I had to see this, I was a bit disappointed to not see the film's director himself at the launch event in Mumbai . But when he was here, the event was held in New Delhi . But I was there , and he had a great time , talking to the media , attending the awards function , etc etc ... I was not impressed with the movie at the launch ..... but I had no qualms when they came to the cinema and saw it .|0
Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained.|1
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber . The film was so successful, it brought a new wave of films to the attention of audiences all over the world . With such an outstanding cast that included Robert Duvall, Michael Rispoli, James Woods, James Cromwell, and Richard Widmark , this was an all out war between two factions and that's why the film was so successful. I just wanted to tell you all how wonderful this film was and all you did was ask for my opinion.|0
"The recent release of `` Mad Dog Morgan '' on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print. The film contains scenes of violence, nudity, and language. The DVD includes an interview with Morgan, where he confesses he has committed acts of sexual and racial aggression against several men in the US. He admits he is a psychopath. Although he admits to raping women, and killing at least three of his victims, he is adamant that it was self-defense against his violent sexual conquests. He tells the reporter, ""I am a man, my actions are what make me who I am."""|0
Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema . ( 1 ) Your average bad cinema . (2 ) That was bad cinema that you see everyday on tv . The good ones , were rare and the bad cinema were not .The second kind of cinema that I believe was bad cinema was the new cinema . The good ones were so rare and the bad ones were all new . Now we have the second kind of cinema - the new cinema . Now you can look for a new film in theatres and see it in cinemas .|0
This is an extraordinary film . As a courtroom drama , it 's compelling , as an indictment on the justice system , and as a celebration of life . The two central figures - Judge Roy Moore and Judge Roy Moore's wife, Kaylie, are the heart of the film, and what makes it a must-see is that both men have a personal story behind them. Moore 's story began when he was in his 30s , and he was married with a child , a daughter. He was divorced and single, and his life was filled with hard work and a love of his family.|0
"Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical ""junior high"" experience. They make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. I can't stand the fake French accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually ""fall"" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parenthesis? Because its all stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit the Mary-Kate/Ashley mold?"|1
"Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. Not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious (""movie horror helps us deal with real horror"", ""you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre"") and pretty trite. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring."|1
"I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact isn't at all. Not so much profound for a such subject. ""eternity"" never-ending life. Experiences after death and ""dejavu"". The film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. It's so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The Middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best."|1
"Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. The ""plot"" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he's called a ""military adviser"" but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not), helping the army of a Latin-American country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a ""sports equipment saleswoman"" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue."|1
"When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book ""Het Gouden Ei""/the movie ""Spoorloos""(outside Holland, this movie has the name ""the Vanishing"" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that 'the American Audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free."|1
As talk-shows go , Larry King Live is not bad , and since he occasionally gets good guests , it’s worth checking out. The program features interviews with presidents from both political party’s , comedians , politicians , and people from the entertainment industry. This is the best of the series , in my humble opinion. There are 6 interviews in this episode. First , the interview with George Bush . Then Larry King goes on his first ever interview with George W . Bush , this was a bit more than he wanted .|0
First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning.|1
"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it."|1
Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the President-elect's wife, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the First Lady dead. This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President.|1
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered through to the end... However, this is not a programme I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as I don't think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found the acting to be, at times, poor.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1

Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also gross but not like this). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. The film makes this plan look that easy. I guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person.|1
In this film , we 're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who is clearly in need, but has yet to reach their full potential; the descent into the abyss of loss, where hope becomes a mirage and all you see are the remains of the hopes of a long dead world; the descent into the deep of despair, when everything is worthless, nothing is left, and you are on your knees. As you can see, there is no escape from this reality that you’ve been brought to.|0
I went to this film having no idea what to expect. I actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.I only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There's A LOT of subtle humor.Here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: A big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society.|1
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling . It also starred Joe Estevez , Gregg Thomsen , and Robert Townsend. Awards
Soultaker received five nominations including three wins: Best Cinematography (Tobey Maguire), Best Sound Mixing (Michael Lang) and Best Production Design (Michael Landon) all at the 14th Academy Awards. The film won for Best Sound by Michael Landon, and the film received two Best Costume Design awards, a Best Sound Effects Editing award, a Best Production Design, and a Best Sound Mixing at the 24th British Academy Film Awards."|0
"...means ""take up and read"", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.Watch out for this young director...he's going places."|1
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also The Floorwalker in this category.Charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.There aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator.|1
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too cute for anyone to actually hate, there’s not a lot of redeeming value for these women. In fact, some of them just get worse and worse with age (I don’t think it was that long ago, after all). I guess there are some exceptions, but overall it was a very mediocre piece. The biggest problem I had with the entire film was that it went to very dark places, but that’s the only problem that really stuck out to me at all.|0
Firstly , few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent 's lover . Secondly , few women professors are good enough to give a good quality education , because most professors are not interested in teaching . So , most students feel they can do all the hard work with a little bit of money. But this time , if I can help the students , I will not only give the money , but also teach them in the best way. I will give the course , but the students also can pay the money , for the course .|0
"Stealing is a crime , and these guys , Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get a taste of what that feels like

This is the kind of story I'm talking about. Kenny Yakkels life has taken a detour for the last few months and it looks like his criminal career may follow a similar trajectory. We first broke the news on Tuesday, November 17th, that Yakkel had been convicted and sentenced to 12 months of probation and 500 hours of community service following an incident in the parking lot of a Minneapolis shopping plaza in November of 2014."|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created . I thought I’d given it some consideration. I think the game does an excellent job, and the story and gameplay are awesome. The voice acting is also pretty good, it’s great to be able to enjoy a movie with the voice work of John Krasinski. I am not a gamer, but I do enjoy the movies. I’d be interested to see more video games in video games. What I do enjoy is seeing video games in a movie theater.|0
I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!! !I did buy this film for a dollar and I've seen much worse for much more! !This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. Eight grand!!! That wouldn't pay for half a minute in Hollywood!! Nevertheless ---- This is top fun film making. If you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. These are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing.|1
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing this film,we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy,such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage,and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said, that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!|1
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this film is equally good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived.Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. There are no parents; they are on their own surviving. Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself.|1
Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda , Stanwyck , and the supporting cast.Never saw this coming. I am just so glad to see these films getting more and more positive critical praise. The fact is that you were not able to see it at all, and you should have seen it, and you are in the minority. The only reason we didn't see it, and the other critics were so nice, was because our local theater was so full that the critics would not even consider showing this film unless it had an all-star cast of directors, actors, and actresses.|0
****SPOILER ALERT**** My boyfriend, some friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We sort of knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints?|1
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes up short.------------ Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. However, the Wild Life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful (""I got Visa...Masterrrrr Charrrrge!!"")"|1
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake , ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake that didn't really show us the full story in any kind of sense of continuity, plot wise. And I'm pretty certain that it would've been a lot darker if the movie had continued with the previous characters instead. But that's just me, and maybe you have an opinion on why or why not you think this one was a mistake and how much you like it as a version of the movie. Okay, let me say first that the only version I have seen was the first.|0
"Of the thousands of movies I 've seen so far , this is the first one which made me think:

Do we really want to watch this ? The plot is a set-up to make the viewer sympathise with the protagonist, not empathise with his story. The story moves in the background and is only revealed when the protagonist is ready to do something heroic. But it is a very simplistic plot, it makes the hero likeable without even trying to show us his story. And the story itself is predictable , it is too much about the hero trying to prove himself to the heroine."|0
This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet.Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and riveting. His displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow, love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or over-the-top. In fact, some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression.|1
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be taking itself so seriously that you just want to punch it in the mouth and walk out, so you might want to get some sleep. It makes me sad when I watch it. I watched it for my friend, she was so mad at it because she thought she was doing something wrong with it and she was like “It’s so silly, I just watched a movie and it’s a big joke.” It makes me sad when it’s just so stupid.|0
Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie , and really squandered it . Do n't be led to believe that a movie about a guy who kills a woman is going to be anything else than a horror movie . After the fact, I could go on and on about that, but I'll spare you that . What I am going to do here is to talk about the movie and how I thought it was all going to work , and why I felt like I got exactly what I was getting and nothing more . First up , what did you think of the movie ?|0
"This movie makes ""Glitter"" look like ""Schindler's List."" Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting a P.O.S. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer/director/producer/actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project gone south, ""Hell Ride"" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on Bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in."|1
"Formulaic to the max. Neither title reflects the serial's actual content, ""Fighting Nazis in Morocco,"" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too."|1
The setup for `` Nature of the Beast '' is ingeniously simple , and fraught with limitless potential for suspense. I will begin with a brief look at some of its major players and the ways that each plays into the story line. Then we will delve deeper into the details. In a sense, this is the way the game works. You do not know who is playing until you have seen them. You do not know who the characters are in advance, you know who will play each role as you play it and you are forced to confront the character you know.|0
"When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it ""the greatest achievement in the history of the American cinema."" That was not wholly tongue in cheek. TW&TL remains Milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. However, TW&TL remains a striking exposition of what once was known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's superb portrayal of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius--and Keith--admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including ""The Rough Riders."")"|1
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice-over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and I didn't quite understand. The movie is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie specifies). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans, and enters into a battle with the bikers.|1
Do n't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover ( at least the Swedish version is not so good, it is a bit too serious, it doesn't give the readers the right atmosphere) and instead read the book with a very positive feeling about the author and her writing. I think the book would work very well if you had a good knowledge about Sweden, especially about the culture and history and how it has influenced modern Swedish society. I have not read the Swedish version, but I guess it could still work.|0
"Okay, so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. ""Hell Ride"" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general."|1
This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent . The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the ending . I do like it, I guess, but not quite as I would have liked. Well, it wasn't the ending that was so bad, but the way it ended. They could have made it more believable, but they chose to just give me what I already had in my head. The characters are great, and so is the dialogue, but they should have gone the whole length of a really well made movie and not just made me think.|0
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood . The plot has many twists and turns as it develops. It is very difficult to describe to an uninitiated audience as to what this thriller will be all about. There is much more that it must be understood before one can grasp the full impact and meaning that lies in each of the story lines and the characters. If you are a fan of the genre you will enjoy this thriller. You should read the novel, watch the film and listen to the audiobook to appreciate what is being told to the audience.|0
While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM , I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was going to be a disaster and it was. The ending left me in utter and total disbelief. I have no idea who wrote these things, but they will remain in my memory forever. It's not that the story is that bad. But, it's just that the writing and the acting and the overall presentation is so bad that it made it hard to care. It's a very sad story in the best sense of the word.|0
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but does include sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off screen.|1
It's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.The movie is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park.|1
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber ( The Sum of All Fears ) does an above average screen version of the novel, but he fails to deliver. His characters do little more than mumble to one another, and it's difficult to imagine anything in the plot actually happening. It's a bit like the plot of The Truman Show, but much more ridiculous. I feel like the film is better in the original Japanese form. I'd love to read a summary of it but I'm not sure there is anything there. In the end I guess it comes down to how well it's read.|0
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary.|1
"I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes ""Legally blonde"" look like ""The Usual Suspects"" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie."|1
Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.|1
I never read the book. Now I don't really want to. I had no clue what this movie was about when I walked into the theatre. I still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but I do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. Two precious hours I can never get back.The storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. Werewolves...or something...a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. And I was correct.The acting isn't horrible.|1
"Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a ""family."" Sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives are coming for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner, explaining ""This is what I wore last Thanksgiving."""|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle.|1
`` The Journey '' is a very good film . Produced in the spring of 1958 , in Vienna , the film has some really interesting scenes in it , including the one in which the two lovers are discussing their situation . In this film the characters have been so real that at times they come across as quite convincing . The other thing about this film is , it was made before the days of the talkies . The actors who play the two lovers are very good . They are great at what they do , even if it is playing a part that is rather out of the ordinary .|0
First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent!|1
Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.|1
"This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the ""author"" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too."|1
so if a guy meets you and he says ' I want you to look at my erection ! ' you can look at it ? He is right, we should be able to have sex with any woman who wants it, not just the ones we like to think we are compatible with. This should never change. We should still look for other women and see if they can be compatible with us. What really bugs me is that we are allowed to be sexless with a woman who has never had a relationship with a man, or a boyfriend, or even a best friend.|0
I 've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film . I 'm in total agreement with all of the criticism , but one thing I feel that everyone is missing . It 's not just the movie , there is much more going on than meets the eye . So for the sake of this review I 'm going to touch on the characters , the back story , the plot , the theme that ties everything together , the special effects, the acting , and the music . This is the movie I 'm going to talk about in this article .|0
This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies . It may have been considered racy in its time, but at least it's no longer as shocking as it was back in 2007. The story centers on two middle-aged white men who meet each other in a bar on their first day at work. But what transpires between them is anything but what you'd expect — in fact it's far too predictable to be remotely believable. It's one of the saddest movies ever made as a result of its lack of passion, and it's probably one of the ugliest movies ever made.|0
"This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of ""Do you need me/us now""? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie?"|1
In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree.|1
The animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After having watched Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. But they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.Otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. I always like hearing the silly voice-overs. They never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of weird looking bugs were cool too.|1
This was Hitchcock 's third Hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of films in which the same character repeatedly reappears in different parts of the story. As the title hints, the film also shows Hitchcock at his worst, and it begins with a film in which he plays an actor in a minor role. It's worth noting that, in this case, it's Hitchcock who is the minor role, and the film seems to indicate that we are meant to see him doing the work he does in the film, but it's not really his fault.|0
The film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. Those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films).|1
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs . It is definitely an awful example of a good game but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws. It certainly is not a terrible game. It's just not the greatest. This is what happens when you try and create a great game that everyone can enjoy. You have to have something for everyone so you can get away with something that everyone can appreciate. It makes it very difficult to just get a game that everyone will love and be satisfied by.|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. The movie in question, which has never been screened in North America, was the director's last before his tragic death, which occurred on February 5. The script was penned by Nikolai Todorov, the film itself by Vladimir Nikitin. The cast was comprised of Yuri Bodrov (Dmitri), Lyudmila Kozakina (Alyona), Nikolay Makarov (Oleg), Evgeny Vlasov (Vitaly), Yuri Mashkov (Mikhail) and Aleksandr Vasiliev (Alexander).|0
First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie.|1
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. Non The main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage.|1
The movie is nothing extraordinary . As a matter of fact , it is an insult to the horror genre which I am sure you all know a great deal about . I will be brief here as I think there is nothing extraordinary about it . It does however do a good job at showing some great acting and great acting in the film. First of all I am going to start with the acting. This film is directed by Stephen Sommers and co written by Jody Davis . It is based on a novel entitled ” The Girl from the Other Side” .|0
Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work.|1
"I was expecting `` Born to Kill '' to be an exciting , high-tension film noir . Instead , it's more like a horror thriller . The film is based on the popular graphic novel from the late 1960s by Robert Crumb. I won't say much about it , as I already have a lot to say about the film . Instead , I'll mention that I loved it , even if I'm not as excited about the movie now as I was then . But this is a film worth checking out as part of your "" must see "" lists for the month of January ."|0
"This is a forgotten classic of a film , and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for `` Gummo `` . This film tells the story of the first person to go to Mars . The movie is still a great time killer , and Harmony Karin had a good hand at it . A little background on Harmony Karin and her career

It is about a girl with the face of Marilyn Monroe . What we know from the trailer is that this could be Harmony Karin, and the movie is based on this. Harmony is a well established actress and director ."|0
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock 's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director , pairing Carole Lombard as a vengeful ex-lover (played by Geneviève Page) with the soprano Gene Kelly. The story concerns an affair with a woman who returns the affection. Kelly's part is just a minor role (though he is a good actor) with Lombard performing the role as an exotic beauty. Hitchcock's film has all the hallmarks of its original source material, a wry sense of comedy and a certain edge, but is more than a bit sappy and one-sided.|0
Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport.|1
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years. There have been other films before that delved into the Vietnam Vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film, as a typical American suburban family, circa 1972, comes apart at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls. The cast is A++++ fantastic with all four actors(with Kathy Bates a stand-out) giving riveting performances. What is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides, but understand all four characters and empathize with them, even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs.|1
"It does not surprise me that this short ( 91 minutes ) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago is now considered a classic ( it has been turned into a television series with a similar premise ) . What does surprise me is that it is still shown and discussed on late night tv . A lot of people still think that the film was made because of the "" sex "" . I do not think any of those things occurred . If there was any sex in this film it was more in the sex scenes with women ."|0
I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film , in the theater . I have a strong belief that it was the greatest film since “The Ten Commandments”, but I think there is more that can be done and it can still be called a masterpiece . The plot of this is a bit complicated, but there are so many great things about it . If you haven’t seen any of my films you should definitely check this one out . I think you will have a much different experience , especially if you are the type of person who likes to see new films.|0
"The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still ""bothered""."|1
"There's only 2 reasons I watch this show...I invested the time already in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you supposed Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is ""who is the fifth cylon"". Poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development."|1
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie . I am in Korea ( please excuse bad English ) and I have watched the movie again, but this time, there are some issues in the movie I didn’t see before. I hope it would have been improved as the new one has some other issues that need to be fixed. The movie is called “The Wages of Sin”. It’s a story about Korean-Americans who lived in America in the 70’s and the hardships they had to face. It’s about being able to live in America legally with your family.|0
Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson , while on an undercover mission to assassinate Adolf Hitler , during World War I, and she is one of the first female spies in the history of the United States. Andrews was also the first woman to earn the rank of captain in the United States Army in World War I and she is also known for her romance with US Army Air Forces pilot Rock Hudson in the war. Andrews served as assistant director and assistant director, as well as as acting director of the Army Air Forces (AAF) in 1917.|0
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film. On its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets who would like to look out for him. Nothing overly interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when Carrie is murdered.|1
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.|1
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X . Luckily , my hopes have came true . You all should start a Kickstarter for this book because you have nothing better than this book to donate. I love this series so much and I'm thrilled to have the sequel so I can read this book more often! It's been awhile since I last wrote in so I have a long way to go and a lot of things to tell you, but let's get started! This weekend I had my birthday.|0
Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? That's not funny, that's just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.|1
After being off the air for a while , Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that , while not exactly what you’d call compelling, will keep you watching for a long time , and will be sure to entertain for years to come. If you have any interest in TV you should not miss this season. If you have any questions about the shows , or would like the full set of reviews and clips, you can find us HERE. The following review and clips are for the season 1 and season 2 of Columbo, and were taken from the season 2 DVD.|0
being a fan of Bela Lugosi,Boris Karloff,and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of Lugosi,Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad.|1
The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel `` Nanny '' Crosby , who runs a boardinghouse and provides the women with domestic labor. When she has a chance, however, she breaks out her sewing kit, starts her own sewing circle and becomes the driving force in a series of increasingly destructive plots. The show opens with the arrival of Crosby , who is in a bit of a rut from working on her own for a while. In fact, the show begins with a plot of her making her first attempt at sewing something herself: a piece of lace for a wedding dress.|0
Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane! '; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits.|1
"I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell 's book tour . I thought it was amazing . Almost everything he said was spot on . He made a very interesting argument that if you think about the ""big picture"", you should be a little more forgiving to the police. He made a great point of that. I can't wait to read the book now that I have a new perspective on things. Thanks again for the book. You really made me think about how I treat people and what is right and wrong. I love your book!"|0
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in twenty-first century Sydney! The last time any Irish gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!)|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I'm unjustly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story.|1
"This one and the one prior `` Toulon 's Revenge '' and the next one seem to be completely different films, though I am not certain as to why this is, since the plot is similar, and the action is mostly similar. I do believe however that there are parts of the plot that are similar, especially the final scenes in Paris. It's a tough film to explain, because it seems so simple to me. I can't find the word ""tragedy"" in any dictionary I've been able to find, but I suspect it's because I can't think of an example in French."|0
Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo . Beautiful scenery , beautiful sets of characters . All I can say is that it’s awesome , this is the best film ever ! I got the opportunity of a lifetime to have my first visit to Japan ! It is a long way for me to leave Japan after watching this movie , it is not only the film , but also the people of Japan ! So here is a list of the best things I saw during this visit to Japan.|0
"to make this short and sweet: i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the ""gener-asian"" of american film making. the acting was sub-par, relying on stereotypes, raised voices, and exaggerated eye-buggery to convey its message. chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry/frustrated/distant/uncommunicative asians. these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. i like to think that us asians are more complex than that.i came out of the movie unconvinced."|1
The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about his own childhood. His father, his brother and sister were murdered by the Nazis in 1942 and his mother is now dead from the wounds of the bombing of her home. The story goes on in various ways for the next few days. In the story, as it opens, the family are in the basement of the manor house and there is a man on the sofa who looks very much like the film’s villain. The family are the only people in the room.|0
"This was shown on a premium channel , so I did n't realise it was made for TV . Even so , it was hilarious . But if you watch it again , you'll realise I was a complete idiot :P

"This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself ""this is going to be really good"". However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. The problem, not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner."|1
"The minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. Then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.This was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (It displays some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's earlier ""Brute Force"")."|1
"""Opposing Force [1986]"" wasn't as good as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and it wasn't as good as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Heck, it wasn't even as good as ""G.I. Jane"", which is pretty sad.The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly IS the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones?"|1
OK , well , no one in their right mind ( s ) would pick up a movie titled ``The Last Action Hero.'' It is a title that has become synonymous with action packed movies. I have to admit , I was a little skeptical about this movie , as its name implies it is an action movie as well as a thriller . There is not much to be found in the trailer for this movie , as the majority of it is just a car racing scene for the sake of the title.|0
All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, I really do. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. But this was hardly even funny...I mean, I guess it was, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks...terrible. And the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13.|1
Created by Dennis Spooner , 'Department S ' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol , based on the real life of US intelligence officer Richard Jewell , as he infiltrated a gang of international terrorists. It lasted only six weeks due to interference by the American government. This was a big show at the time, and its ratings did not match those of the police dramas at the time, so it had to be cut. In the series, Jewell is sent to London by Interpol to investigate what he thought was a terrorist operation.|0
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary. It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds.I spent a few years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced Japan to get it. I was watching this with a well-travelled friend who's never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief.|1
Right up ( or down ) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool to me when we were kids but it never clicked until the very end. And now it's here. I had no idea when I bought it at the cinema that it was so well done, it was as good as it was because it was a movie I could have seen and enjoyed with my own child, instead I spent the money and then went and watched a movie I really wanted to watch with my own kids, I felt like a terrible parent when it was all over.|0
"I ca n't disagree with a previous comment that `` Driving Lessons '' is more than a little twee , or even a tad pretentious. I didn't know what you meant with that. And I think the movie is definitely worth a watch and I'm glad to know more about the history of the movie. It is fun and very educational! My 2 cents

If you go to this site, you'll see that there is a page that has a review of the DVD that was sent to us. It is a good film but, I would not expect to see it in my home theater."|0
"A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the ""Godzilla"" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like ""The Loch Ness Horror"". And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits."|1
Great acting, great production values, good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For instance, we're very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.This is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books.|1
Irvine Welsh 's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh , all with their own distinct voice . Welsh 's debut feature film is set in Edinburgh as two friends meet up for the first time after the break up of their relationship. The story is told through the two actors in an interview with David Walliams 's son . In the first story, which follows the three friends as they are walking through the streets of Edinburgh , the camera pans over them to capture their reactions in each of the shots .|0
I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I couldn't say it better. The worst movie I've ever seen... and I've seen lots of crap! When I read you comment I thought only about the thoughts I had while watching the movie. When I saw who was one of the script writers I understood it. Balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. And his scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young Americans coming on vacations.|1
"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its ""Sita"" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men."|1
"While not as bad as some movies (like the horrible ""Atomic Twister""), ""Meltdown"" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a Masters Degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.Riding the false fear that a Chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an American plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area."|1
One of the commenter 's is wrong . This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he did n't say that . And yes, the author of this blog has seen every one of his films. You can search the blog archive to look up his filmography . If you do that, you'll find he has a great number of films. I'm not sure how many . I've seen most of the ones that make it into my archive . What do you mean by 'not his' ? It's his. It's his blog. It was his film.|0
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture ( if you may consider it as a film ) may be one of the very best. But , I would really like to inform you about the worst motion picture I have seen as well as that it was one amongst the ones I have seen in quite some time . It’s just awful in the worst way and that is the most awful way. I am going to explain this terrible motion picture . If you’re interested in watching , you can easily find it online.|0
David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over.|1
Except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was patronizing and convoluted. Without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note.|1
"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II."|1
I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself , but I was disappointed. We start with the main villain of the story and I was expecting him to actually make an impact in the film. That’s not what happens. The first time we hear of the name of the villain, we hear that his real name is “The Great” and it is the name he is known for. But the villain in the story is not The Great. The main villain’s true name is The King.|0
"Yes, I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!"|1
"There are places for political commentary in film, but ""Masters of Horror"" is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another ""Bush is bad!"" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a ""message"" film, be a little more sly about it."|1
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits.|1
The prior comments are way to generous . This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic . On the plus side this movie does have one of the hottest girls in the biz and one of the hottest guys ever and it is a shame they decided to go with the one chick that they thought was too old to have sex anyway. I have to admit I thought she did a great job and it looks like she could be pretty good in the biz. The only issue with this movie is that they could have at least been better and made it more adult.|0
Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.It's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are just adequate at best. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed.|1
Oh , my . Oh , this is a * really * bad movie . The acting is absolutely atrocious . And I can't even be * mad * at this . And I can't really * be * mad * at it . It has * to * go * in .

"******Spoilers within******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clichéd bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself, ""Let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?"" Yup, I was right."|1
I really hated this movie and it 's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did n't finish. My first choice was to give it a pass, but this movie scared me and my wife. It was extremely dark and bleak. The ending had me questioning everything that we had done, including what we had gotten ourselves into to begin with. The movie was also very suspenseful and I did think that it was a bit scary at times. It was not a very good movie though, I am not really a fan of King's works.|0
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of the books and extras. This week I had a quick scan and found that there was an error on one of the pages, I’d forgotten that I ordered a PDF version and I’m hoping someone can look at the PDF to get the error corrected. This has been a bit annoying as the PDF I have has a different layout and the pages for the main game are all on one page which makes scanning a bit cumbersome.|0
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film ? it was given to me on video, i thought i would get some pleasure from watching this film, after all it was directed by a guy who used to make movies. well i have wasted too many times watching this film, now that i can see it for myself, i could really have had some fun. it was so sad, all the good things that could have been had ended up being nothing. the only way to get happiness now is to kill yourself, and that will leave you with nothing but nothing.|0
SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo ? Yep , that 'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of `` Lord of the Rings'' movie series, when we saw Frodo and company riding into Mordor, I always wondered what it would look like in the film.I have never seen an elf movie , or a movie about elves . It seemed to me that the whole concept of elves was a fairy tale . As such, even if there was an entire world of them, there must have been more than just a few people who could be said to be elf. It seems I was wrong .|0
I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp-fun?|1
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom . I look here on IMDB , even though it is a very small part of the films that I really like. So I was not expecting a very good film. But still I couldn't wait to find out, so here are my thoughts. Movies I thought were great:

The Matrix Revolutions

I'm going to start off by saying that if you've not watched the Matrix Revolutions it's a must see, but you have to watch the second Matrix to really truly enjoy the movie."|0
Note : After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the movies. But for those who are wondering the answer is that we have actually seen the movie already. So here is the link. Now I have to tell you that I have not actually watched the movie. I know that it was a good film but I was still a bit confused about it. I did not understand that there was a lot of violence and sex but it was actually quite good. As you can see in the trailer, this movie looks awesome!|0
Three distinct and distant individuals ' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . The one-hour film explores the circumstances of the incident, as well as those who were at the home of the two individuals. The film begins with an interview with the subject. The film then begins a reenactment of the events that led to the murder . When the subject asks to be moved out of the car the police arrive and they shoot him dead. In a separate interview we see the subject and his girlfriend trying to explain how they came to be in the home that they are in at the moment .|0
"The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns . Have a good look at this film from its opening to the end . A young boy is forced to kill himself in a dark forest . What's the best way to handle this , in the beginning or in the later part . ""It was the director who taught me how to do these kind of shots. The way to do these shots is not so different from a documentary but it is also very different"". As the film progresses, we see that the world is changing in many ways ."|0
I started to watch this show by accident , but I love it . The fact that main character is a little girl and the story is interesting makes it an amazing show , and I love the idea of a young girl growing up in an abusive home . My only criticism is that in the very beginning of the show , I felt there were a few points that needed to be explained , and I wondered why it took so long . I also felt it was quite long , which is not a huge complaint , but it just felt a bit like it was just too much to read through .|0
"If you enjoy suspense this movie has it . The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her performance and makes her look even more believable . Her character is not a typical female in a spy movie , it seems as if she's not a real person. This movie has some great suspense scenes in which the suspense grows and gets more intense . The ending was great , as well as the way the movie closed . If you like this movie and have not yet watched the movie or seen it , watch it! Reviews & Ratings

The film was great!"|0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . Incredibly bad . Very pretentious . It would be nice if they tried something a bit lighter and didn’t over complicate the plot . There are some interesting things going on here but it feels a bit like they were going to try something a bit more original and new . The plot of the movie revolves around a family of five that goes to stay with an uncle and aunt who has a mansion on the lake . There are a lot of interesting characters in the film . It could have been interesting but instead it is boring .|0
This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway.|1
I will commend it in only one respect .. it was innovative . Innovative does n't mean it 's a better version of anything. But in the first place it was innovative .. it's better than anything else out there . But then it's also better than most other games on this planet .. but it's not out there for everyone. I don't think people are interested in trying new stuff out, especially with the amount of games that are released each month. I think more games need to have new concepts to be popular. I think there needs to be more new games out there.|0
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey.|1
I have watched two episodes so far , I really like it . Even though I am no longer in college and do not have any knowledge of the television medium , I have a good opinion of the show. I like the story line and the humor in the story. The acting is great. The characters do not seem like the characters you would find on television . I think it is a well done show , I would love to see a full season of episodes. Thank you for a great series. I thought it was great when I first started watching.|0
First of all , I have watched this show since I was a little toddler , and I have always enjoyed it, and even though I have always had high expectations I was not disappointed. And it has been fun to watch. I am a little confused as to why this episode was not better. It is really, really short. I am wondering if I should give this one a pass. I am sure it is better than it has always been but I do not know how to justify it. The story itself was interesting, but it did not really make it better.|0
I was once a big Olsen fan . I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost daily for many years. Even after I stopped being an Olsen fan, I have continued to enjoy this movie on occasion. I liked that it wasn't a typical teen movie and that there were plenty of laughs throughout. It's not perfect, but there are some laughs in it and that's about it. It has been a long time coming. This is definitely a good movie that is worth a watch if you're looking for a movie with good acting, funny dialogue and a decent plot.|0
If you Listen to Ween ( The Pod , God/Satan ) , then you know what 's going on with 's the world. What I mean is that most, if not all of the time in history, in the last 30 years, the media, the political classes, the business classes, the churches, have been very, very bad for this country, very, very bad for this country, for this country. It has been, and continues to be a very bad thing for this country and the people of this country to listen to all of this crap.|0
There are places for political commentary in film , but `` Masters of Horror '' is not one of them , as the film is made for and by the masses of Americans. The message is not important. The story takes place in New York City about three years into the Cold War. The hero is a middle aged man. His wife and young son have moved to California. He is being followed by a local police detective. The police suspect that the victim was killed by someone who has been impersonating a cop. They want the killer caught and the man arrested.|0
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to the same sorts of mistakes he makes. There is a good reason that his work is not widely recognized or appreciated today. I think a movie about a poet that has never been produced before is more likely to get an audience, which I suspect is one reason why it is unlikely to be the subject of the next Thomas biopic. This is especially the case because, although Thomas’s life is interesting, his artistry is often overlooked because his work has not yet been widely accepted.|0
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their scenes together and the way they interact with one another as a group, which creates an interesting dynamic. There is a lot of eye-rolling with the audience when they find out this was a film by a writer/director who did not have any filmmaking experience and it is obvious that some of them could have been a bit more confident of their ability. If there is anything you liked about the film, there is something that you will also find a lot of people saying.|0
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film . After years of being on the stage , Grace is about to take her first ever film role . She plays a young American actress trying to become a famous actress . Her first screen test goes horribly wrong and Grace finds herself on the brink of failure and a lifetime of self-destructive acting choices . She takes her life in her own hands and becomes an actress that no one will recognize for what she has become . As the film progresses we find out that Grace is only in the film to play a character .|0
This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts . Donald and his son have had enough of this life. What they have done is not the right thing, and not the easy thing. This is the life they must go back to. It is a journey that the world will not see, but what they have been through will. It is a journey of change. And the only way we can change it is by going back into the life we love.|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You'd think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising.|1
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I would predict Andy Warhol might make--airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movie's rough, real-looking cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, yet dictating reality to the viewer. The only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device.|1
I 'm sorry , perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 , perhaps it won't always be but I want to share my personal story with you . I 'm not a firefighter but a nurse for over 30 years . One of the first thing I did upon arriving at my office was to search for an EKG reader and was told they are out of stock and can't be located . I knew someone that was selling EKG's so I asked to see a sample but was told we had to buy the book to have one.|0
This film was n't good at all . I was able to catch it at a film festival and did not get it in my home theaters. If anyone else did, please post it here for the fans to see and comment on how much this film sucks. I would really like to hear your thoughts about it . It was good . The characters were good and it wasn't that bad to watch. But, it just wasn't a great film . It wasn't even close . I didn't like the ending and I felt it could have been made much better.|0
"Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is ""manager"" Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him."|1
In general , I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I 'm afraid of everything for the first five minutes of each movie. I'm usually at least a 3 or 4 star horror movie. The only times I would recommend a horror movie I have a very hard time watching, because I feel like my brain is being overtaxed and my mind is going a bit crazy. I'm not saying this is because I'm a terrible movie buff or something. It's just that it isn't a good horror film and that scares me as much as a horror movie does.|0
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself. The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart.' The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from. Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie. I expected a sort of crappy, direct-to-video version of `Heathers' targeted at the teenagers of today.Let me tell you what `Tart' was really about.|1
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival . Rupert Grint shows he can act and I am so happy to have found a film that I know will do a brilliant job of telling the story of driving lessons. Grint is a driving instructor who, like me, has been driving lessons for around ten years now. He has a good relationship with a number of drivers and is a great teacher. It was nice to see a film with both of us doing our bit in showing people how to learn to drive a car safely and how to teach them how to improve their skills.|0
Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl ! Great soundtrack , plausible story , wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of what it was like to be living in the Valley.

We'd like to thank all of the fans that helped make that a reality. You can help support the band and the album by shopping at iTunes or buying from the following links .|0
Well , this is new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director, here he is playing one of the main characters, and here we have the opening credits . In this movie Lucio Fulci portrays one of the most iconic characters in Italian horror cinema, the Italian horror director Lino Banfi. You can see the full clip of the film, and you can see the trailers for it. You can also see it now , on Netflix. You can watch it over here.|0
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I've seen both of those as well as Chop Shop and like in many instances, I don't feel the comparison is warranted. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added.|1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy , it gets right in to it right from the very start . It is a brilliant film. If you are a gorehound you will really like this one , and if you are someone who enjoys action and comedies then this is definitely something to watch. I can’t really say enough about this film for anyone who is looking to make it a point to check it out on release. There is something about seeing this film on the big screen, that I find more enjoyable than the big screen version.|0
"I can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can't imagine anything better.First, there's the music -- take ""Johanna"" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition."|1
This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet , Mishima . It jumps around from one place to the next. Mishima takes you on an imaginative journey with him through his childhood and adolescence. In the end it is clear that Mishima is a good guy, even if at the end there is much sadness and loss. In this film, there is a lot of violence as the characters in the film do not know how to live without violence. There are many scenes of graphic violence and the story takes you places that you never imagined.|0
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance.|1
"A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while it may not quite be a masterpiece, it’s an impressive debut. It’s called “Viral.”

And while this is not their first film, it is by far their best. This week, I’ll tell you all about what you can expect to see in this debut that I have no doubt that you’ll come back to again and again to watch. “Viral.” In theaters this weekend."|0
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years. It struck home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson/Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How large the real table was on which Treat danced. How driven the wizard behind the curtain.|1
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . In the first, the main character is a young man who makes a pilgrimage to Italy to be with his beloved. The second two stories involve young women, who must go to Italy, to visit their lost love. The third story, about a teenage girl, who visits Italy to be with her father, is also about fantasy and imagination, and also deals with love and romance . I find the stories very interesting and thought provoking, and they also seem very relevant to my own life .|0
"I can see what this film was intending to do. Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. The ""reality crime"" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book."|1
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart, and I think this is one such work. The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art.|1
For the most part , I considered this movie unworthy of a comment , but the last 10 minutes prompted me to make a few observations. The only real issue I found myself thinking about was whether this is a film about racism. This isn’t an allusion to actual racism, but rather a movie about racism in general and the way that it was handled . In other words , it doesn’t seem to take itself as seriously as many movies do. This is the case with a lot of movies out there .|0
My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF ( a film festival of movies). A lot of movies come out in this theater. But I’ve got to pick the best of these movies now. I love them all, but I’ve had a favorite in my head since my childhood and I’ve always wanted to see them again. I decided to write a post about a movie I’ve been meaning to watch and finally did it. Let’s take a look at some of the good, bad and best in the film industry.|0
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I couldn't help but think back to the films I've seen when I'm bored and just want to have a good laugh. For this film it's pretty much the same thing, but as soon as I was through watching the film I remembered why I was so interested. It is a very funny and entertaining film and I enjoyed it very much, not only because I laughed, but also because the characters are so relatable and you can feel their emotions in their actions and reactions.|0
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the movie! It was worth the wait. I am very impressed with the quality of the movie and I am looking forward to seeing more of the movie. It will definitely be worth the price to own the movie. I've seen it in the theater twice. The movie is very good and well worth watching. However, the movie was not all that entertaining. It's hard to see why this movie is such a commercial success.|0
We've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. In fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on June 25, 1945.The war on Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a Nazi spy ring was helping out the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater.|1
Well , great costumes and a wonderful ` feel ' for Pre WWII Italy . But what happened here ? I am always so curious . Did you see what happened to these Italians during WWII or do I just have to wait until they come out on their own ? I am so curious . I would really love to read a full account of the show. It has always seemed that it was very important to these people. I wish someone would write about it. Please help . I am very curious. I am thinking of reading an article about that.|0
This film is terrible - honestly . The acting is terrible , the script made me cringe , the effects aren’t even worth a mention . The cinematography looks awful , and the production design looks awful . The story is terrible . And worst of all , we have not even been given half the ending we should have . What a shame ! The ending, I think, is great . The ending could have been better . The movie was not that great to begin with . I would have thought a movie that had that ending might have been good .|0
This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal, where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives.|1
Oh boy. Where do I begin on this piece of slime? This is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that I've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...For the first thing, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot.|1
I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'.While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made.A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations?|1
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January ( 2005 ) I did n't like it at all , the story was good , but it could not make me laugh . This movie is more for those who hate horror and those who just want to scare people , it is also for people who like good suspense . This is not a good movie , you can see it , but be prepared to laugh at the time you see the funny parts !!! 1 out of 5. User review of This movie: Not my cup of tea.|0
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone 's favorite master of suspense . As usual , the technical elements such as the audio are spot on , and the editing is excellent. This film has its moments and it definitely has it all. Not the best, but no doubt it has its merits. If you can handle the suspense, then you have to watch this. The film is about a man who goes to an all-girls' school in California. One day, an accident happens at his school and a young girl is killed.|0
I really don't know why I'm writting this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this:When I first get done watching some movies, I like them. Then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So, to resolve this, I watched it again at a friends house. Well, it's bad.I'm a logic person.|1
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on Quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such faint praise from me.|1
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now . The acting is top notch and I am thoroughly impressed. The story was really well done, it was a very believable story. The way that the story played out and the relationships between the characters are very well done. I really enjoyed it, there are some scenes that are just really good. I would give this movie 3.75 out of 5 stars. I really recommend this movie to everyone because it really is a great story. I hope you find it for sale on Vudu.|0
Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror , science fiction and suspense films from the early to mid 80’s . It was directed by , starring , and written and co-produced by , and it stars and his wife . It is directed by . The plot follows a woman named , who moves into an apartment complex and finds herself in an uneventful and mundane routine. The next day she discovers that , and , have come to visit her . She finds herself in an uneventful routine of doing the same thing and getting the same results .|0
Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters.|1
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Beckett (Julia Roberts) who is constantly at odds with her own mother, played by Meryl Streep. The film opens as her character’s mother (Meryl Streep) is having a tough day in the kitchen. The dish she is preparing is to be a dish she and Kate are not very excited about. And it is. And she tells the story. And it is. And it is. And it’s over in less than 45 minutes.|0
"Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor actors. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The ""Arab terrorists"" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the ""Arab terrorist""...DAMN!There is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like).The movie is divided into two parts."|1
I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it.|1
Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters ? Firstly the script is one of the worst I have ever read. It starts off good but then you start to wonder what has happened and who is doing the killing. I can understand why the writers felt they had no choice but to kill a character, it makes no sense as the character is dead at that point. Also the character that is alive in the book after the death of the previous character has not aged. It feels a bit forced to have the character start off young again.|0
"My son Adam (5 years old) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He like this film a lot. He particularly liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.Having seen the ""Vampire Rock"" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.Few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the TV cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. You either like this or love it."|1
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it doesn't have any continutity. It feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software!!! Music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby deol is good.|1
Unlike one of the reviewers below, I don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. Whereas it is good to see a British director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex.|1
As an ex ( nuclear ) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie ( even exceeding my personal favorite ) - even better than the original Silent Running ( although I am not sure I would go out on a limb to compare this to that movie ) and as a kid that's saying something . The only drawback is I never saw the original version , but the movie still has its flaws and it was better in my book than the new one . This movie is pretty much the original version of Silent Running, not the one with some big budget effects.|0
A MUST SEE documentary.-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client.|1
"Well , I 'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento , Fulci , and others , so I was wondering how many of my fellow Italians love horror movies and if they know some really good ones. In Italy there are quite a few horror movies made and some really good ones, so I was wondering if some of them are really good horror movies or if there are only those who love this kind of films. So I will say this:
I love a lot of Argento's films ."|0
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good.|1
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time.|1
"Hope the summary line wo n't irritate you that much ( it 's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Rose show). It was a fun way to start, though. I'd like to read a review with an intro that doesn't just get you up and moving to start the show. I think you guys would have been way cooler and better off with a bunch of guys like you. I was just watching the show on TV, and I thought ""Wow, that dude is a good singer."" I'm sure he didn't come from nowhere."|0
"I was expecting ""Born to Kill"" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. Instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a ""glamor"" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after ""Dillinger"" (an overrated movie but at least better than this)."|1
"Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as ""Poison Ivy"", must have done this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer on ""Ivy""); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!"|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker , Jr . He 's a young gun who has spent five years in the army and is looking to return to civilian life. But he's been called upon to take on some of the most dangerous killers of the day, as he attempts to stop their crimes with a gun in his hand. Walker played the title role to great applause from the audience, and the audience went wild for him. He has one scene in which he is shot twice, the bullet in his head.|0
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull . Well , after watching this video , now I feel a bit bad , since I bought this on the 3rd of November, the same day the set was announced , it had been out for over a month , I still didn’t even know the movie was released on a Wednesday, I guess it was a good idea for me to buy this at midnight on the 4th. I don’t mind that it came out the same day I wanted it to release.|0
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado , played to perfection with expert timing and panache , then this is the performance for you. The story is a bit like that of many great tales. There is a hero, or the hero and his love, or a lover and his beloved, or a father and his son . The heroine is another story, and in fact , there are several stories involved, and perhaps even more than the one you are reading. And, even with all the stories, there are a few stories that are linked.|0
"First off , I 'm a huge Bronson fan , have been since the late '70s . I watched every single Bronson film that came out. He has one of the best comedic characters out there. If you want to watch them all you need to get Bronson. I can't recommend it enough . Quote:

Second off, I 'm going to say the same thing you are. I have been listening to Bronson's stuff for a few years now and have been absolutely loving it . He has the best writing voice out of anyone. I can't wait for what he will do next ."|0
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous one, which was pretty good, but not as good as other ones, which were great. I thought this one would have a lot of the characters in the previous movies, and a lot less. I am not sure I would go to see this movie, but if it had to be, this one would not be my first choice. The characters are more developed, the action is more intense. The music is good, the special effects are not that great in this movie.|0
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he's had his successes and failures, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: They will be something unique.|1
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd , and even more bizarre is that there are only three black men on the force. So what do they drive? Is it an armored vehicle for the LAPD, or perhaps a private company? Either way it seems to be an armored car driven by the LAPD, and it sure doesn't look like its made of steel and Kevlar. When you put it together all of these images, it all seems a bit surreal. What's going on here, and how can the police be doing this in LA?|0
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome.|1
Oh , dear ! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . It 's just a bad movie ! The acting is pathetic , and the acting is very bad . Even when it was good , the acting was horrible . The movie is also very long , and it's a bit confusing . It 's not a good movie . And if I saw it for a second , I am sure I would throw it in the trash ! I really hate this movie ! Why did they make it ? And why is this movie only in English ?|0
Frank Falenczyk : It is n't that I 'm sorry I killed them ; it 's that I 'm sorry that I'm so damn damn stupid I couldn't have done less than I should have done ! I never should have believed them, not when they were right ! Eugene O'Mara : It is not so much that I'd like to know what really happened, that is quite enough of an explanation ! The only thing I want to know is how they were able to think that this was no longer a fight between good people, but between murderers and traitors !|0
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation.|1
NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of `` The Ten Commandments '' and `` King Kong,'' but they elected to do the reverse. For the first time in over 20 years, and for the only time in more than 50 years, they made two of their films from the same story line, as opposed to having one and only one for the story line. The ``Avengers'' and ``Star Trek'' franchises have been in the business for a lot longer than this.|0
It 's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is all a game, that they're on the winning end, that they think this is their world and that they can win any game, any time. And that makes me sad and very, very frustrated. It's not because I'm a woman. I'm not interested in the gender. I have the same interest as anyone in this world and this time, I'm not going to waste my time, I'm not going to do anything.|0
Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. But in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects. The blood effects are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives, this runs kind of like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?)|1
First of all , even IMDb is slacking with this movie , as the list of cast is VERY ``bad`` . The lead actor , Michael Caine , has no presence in this movie as a lead , and the entire cast appears to be unappreciated by the audience , with no real ability to bring anything to the table for the movie . The first half of this movie is quite entertaining , although not as engaging as the second half , for which this movie is totally undeserving . The plot of the movie is very convoluted , and the movie becomes even more annoying to watch , because of it.|0
Wow ! After the first five minutes of watching this `` film '' , I was quite tempted to put it on my Dvd player and watch it at leisure, as I could see it as an interesting and original movie. But, when I went on to take a look at my VCR , I could not find any other video on VCD. I thought this would be another interesting film , but I could not see what it was about. Then, I found it on this site , and there it was.|0
"""The Quickie"" tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and...well, frankly, this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary.Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob-guy as being from ""Pacific Exterminators"" with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say ""West Coast Exterminators"". Eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh).In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets ""live""."|1
"If a movie ca n't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes , it 's over as far as I am concerned . movies like "" "" , and and "" "" can hold you for about half an hour . this time , however , "" "" is the most over-rated movie in recent memory . 
"" "" is actually a pretty good film . it 's based on an original play written by the famous , , "" "" director . and it 's about as good as one can get . when this movie first came out , I was quite impressed , 
I was so interested in what it 's about ."|0
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time . The kind of title that ruins the moment. It doesn't even make sense at the outset, it seems so simple, like the title of a joke, but then when the movie starts and you watch it, it takes you down some pretty dark and twisted paths in the first 15 minutes and you're never sure which one is which. If you've seen this film, you know what to expect, it's not for everybody and you don't even really know why it's bad.|0
Well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end. It has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. Nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.|1
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes.|1
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made??|1
What a self-indulgent mess ! Duncan Roy 's film is apparently autobiographical , however it 's impossible to find any information about it. It's been so long since your last comment I don't know why you keep bothering to post it ! But, I guess it's just because you are obsessed with the subject. For the first time I've seen a film like this, and I liked it ! And that's exactly what it was ! But I'm not going to mention all the details here, because it'd be too tedious for you.|0
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home? How does it even get to be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and I use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? I'm all for DIY film making but come on! That doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie.|1
I 'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that region. It was a shame because this is a classic film. I have always had a special relationship with the Brazilian people because I was born in the South and I've grown up in Rio de Janeiro. I lived in Rio for a long time and I have a lot of friends from all over the place. This movie really touched my heart because it was a love story that really made people happy.|0
"The good things first : I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene in ""A Life of It."" I've never seen it, and it might be my favorite scene in any movie. The story and acting are solid enough. It would be a shame if Gene's character did not develop over time. But that's not really Gene's fault, since Gene's character does not develop nearly as well as the character of his son. The other actors do well."|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours, I can't seem to forget this haunting film. A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.The actors, though not that well known are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances.You believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. The direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect.|1
"Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"", which covers remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic."|1
This movie really is that bad , and I 'm normally a sucker for bad movies , but this was the worst of them so far !!!! I mean really , there was just too much bad taste in it and it just looked so cheap , for what ? I mean , they didn't have that much talent in there ? But the worst part of this movie is that they even try to bring back a couple of the characters we had seen in the first part !!! What the fuck ? What the hell is going on ?|0
"I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters."|1
If extreme activities ( and I do n't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games ) and the people that engage in those activities is where we should put our focus, not how much money is spent at the box office, but what it costs to create, market, distribute, and protect that content. It's not the box office figures that are important, the content is what matters, if it has any value at all. I think that's what's really going on. That said, this thread is getting ridiculous.|0
Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot.|1
* * Possible Spoilers Ahead * * Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes , there will inevitably be someone to spoil the film ahead of time. It is inevitable, I'm sure , because bad movies are everywhere and there is a constant stream of fresh new ones coming out all the time. It is hard not to take the spoils from these films with a grain of salt so I thought it would be interesting to discuss some of the most notorious examples and see what you thought. Let's begin with some classics and then some more obscure films that we have already seen.|0
This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks.|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load that I have ever seen on a wide scale! The story, which is a combination of ‘real’ stories from real people, was a great introduction to what was going on on the show! I think it’s the biggest documentary movie that I have ever seen! This movie is just too much for me to sit through (I’m sure some will find it funny). I just cannot get into the whole “story of why they did it” part of the movie!|0
"This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a Jeff Bridges fan as I am I guess.Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road. His parents believe he is ""just acting out"" and talk about how ""he has no plan""."|1
Where do I begin? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real.|1
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film . We 're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project and the Saw movies. This movie is a disaster from the beginning. The acting, the script, the direction, it all falls so flat that I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. This is the movie for people that don 't care about a lot of things that they think are important. I can think about everything else in this film, I don 't need to see it anyway.|0
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly 's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent, but it was on the sound stage where he got his first big break as a writer and director, creating the classic movie musicals of some of Hollywood's most legendary directors, including the screen's greatest directors of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. But even after his breakthrough, he struggled in the job of director because of his age and inexperience, and it took him a few years to become a respected film director. He has directed eight movies, and he is working on an eighth.|0
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness. not only was the name a complete misnomer--since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas--but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately i waited until the end in my case. that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim.|1

I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. The acting was over the top. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl.|1
I do n't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad . It Was Great , and I did like it . For the most part though, I just think it wasn't the best way to go about it. Sure, the writing, and the story was good . However, the acting was a little . . . let's call it a let down . And there were a few scenes that were too long. There were some parts of it that were just a little . . . well, not enough .|0
"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out ""Undisputed 2"". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched ""The Shepherd"", I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen."|1
What a crap that movie is . The script is simply non existent . The movie at times seems like the cast was in on something . just watch a few minutes of the trailer and you get the feeling . . . you are going to be shocked that there is really such a big hole in there . now there are so many movies that are based on historical fiction . why not one that is actually based on a real historical figure? why not one that has actually been documented? well . . . in my humble opinion, you could just call it .|0
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into Moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this film, I was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (I'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from Biblical texts.|1
'The Dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.As 'Sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'King Lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times.|1
Well , I fear that my review of this special wo n't heed much different observation than the others before it. I don t know , I m sorry for that. But in order to have a better experience I have to express my thoughts that i m sure some people would like to hear , I m sorry also , for my ignorance that i may lack in this regard. So , i m here to tell y my thoughts. So , here goes : First of all I m glad that the special edition was made available and it is so amazing .|0
"Oh my God... where to begin? ""Chupacabra Terror"" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes ""Demon Slayer"" look like ""The Exorcist"". Special note: A Horror B-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a hot girl in this one. With that inexcusable mistake, I should begin with the complete bash.First of all, if you're going to make a Horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a ""cool"" monster outfit."|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. The stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. But then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. This movie ranks just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling.|1
The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing.|1
What a crappy movie ! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in the village. But she was brought up by her aunt (who is supposed to have married an Indian guy). The rest of the family were in the USA. She then got married and left for India as a bride. She never got the opportunity to learn Hindi. After marriage, they moved to another village. There, the father of her new husband was a farmer. But the husband of her new husband was not that good and he treated her very badly.|0
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini.|1
"MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous ""Enter the Dragon"" from '73, this one is an effort from South Africa. The villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a Baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the ""Dr.No"" or Han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany."|1
What can I say...not much to this one at all. Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are just OK. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No one else rose above mediocre.The story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere.|1
Just saw this movie on opening night . I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it. And yes it does have a lot of action, but there are also a couple of interesting stories woven into the plot which makes it worth it. The best bit of the movie is the ending. It is so sad and touching, I am so glad that it happened. I am not a good person and I have never said or thought the things the character is going to say at the end. I just didn't see it coming.|0
I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue.|1
I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt.|1
"Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters ( Played by Jeff Daniels)

Gossett makes his way into the second unit with a strong performance which includes an early hit and a late rally with a double, a walk and a run on second base to set up a double to load the bases with the score 2-1. Gossett came through again to make it 3-1 on a single to right field and two walks and a strike out from the bottom of the 10th to take the game 3-2."|0
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? There is a scarecrow murdering people there. Only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. Whats the scarecrows secret? Will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK but picture is really corny. The plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical.|1
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. He shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family. It is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would.|1
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap , thinking it would be a typical , crap straight-to-video monster junk. Nope. It is not typical. In fact, you'd probably think it's one of those things that you need to pay $30 for in order to buy, so that you could get some kind of value. But this DVD does in fact contain some really cool footage. Now here's the issue with this video, and it's not just because the quality is not up to the standard set by some of the newer releases.|0
This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés.|1
It's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre I find that Novo is an insult to Se Souvenirs.|1
For a teenager who has never read Austen , this adaptation might be fine . But only for them . The characters and the story are all very young and the writing is very bad . A story about what happens when a boy who wants to be an artist has no parents and is not going to have a father . A story where the author should know that she has no talent and she has no skill . And there is one character in this story that is the protagonist . If you don't have a clue as to the character you should probably just skip reading the rest of the post .|0
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! The plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. More unrecoverable life time wasted!If you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once.|1
`` Escape from Hell '' is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation .' That's right - this one is pretty much unreadable. I think I'm going to just give up, go back to college and write something else - I can write it if someone takes the time to help with the translation - and I'd just be glad if there were someone who cared to do it so I didn't have to sit and stare at the screen. You know, I have a hard enough time trying to decipher this one as is : crass exploitation .|0
When i went to see this i thought , i liked the first two and thought that they were very well done and i was looking forward to their next part, and then i read it was going to be more like the first two and i did not like it. I dont understand why they did this. I think the last part is going to be better. Maybe its because i got a bit older and they have a younger target audience that i don't care for. I'm so glad i didn't purchase it but now i don't feel the need to look for another book.|0
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun : a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a sniper, and then she’s rushed through a burning building to the safety of another, more dangerous building. The sniper then shoots her to make sure she doesn’t wake up from her coma. A bunch of other call girls go to the other building to rescue the first, but they end up in a very different place. It makes no sense and has no real action, just lots of action scenes.|0
If the following sounds tempting , then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie. I would not advise that you rent it by itself, but that would be the only time this movie can be seen by you. I can guarantee that the sound will not be the focus of your enjoyment as the film itself, but the experience in general. It is one of those films that comes to you while you are on vacation, that makes the trip that much more pleasant. I know this because I have seen it when I was in Europe on vacations of many years.|0
"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...The strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a real treat."|1
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit. How darethey? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.I really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.|1
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film ? ! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER , with better actors and a better storyline than MARY POPOVICH. The main reason of its success was that both MARY POPOVICH & MARY WOODS are so good that it's hard to imagine that it would be worth remaking a film with them, but it's NOTHING if it's not worth remaking! It's better to remake it than to write a new script for it. So, let's talk a bit about MOSTHLY MARTHA.|0
This can hardly be called a good movie , actually it 's not even close . But I have to say that I enjoyed it . for a movie set in the 70s which I was expecting to be very good . and even with all its shortcomings . if you are looking for a movie that has a good story and good performances . then this one might not be a bad choice . one of the characters has a heart of gold . another character was a little too close to the line of the law . even a few scenes with a lot of sex and violence .|0
The series does not start as it means to go on. Although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. The first ever episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and Marina Sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. Seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually.|1
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer . What really bothers me is the name, as in it's a rip-off. As I have already stated on this board before, I'm not giving this flick any stars. I'm just making a point that this movie is bad. It's like the movie was put together by someone that was a complete dumbass. It's bad enough that they put the actual actors in, but to put in a voice coach as an actor and make him sound like John Travolta is a bad move.|0
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle.|1
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. Actually, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. It isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.The story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent.|1
I was really beginning to enjoy this show. It just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved. It is summertime so many people are not at home watching television. I know there are a few talent and singing competitions but I enjoy them as do many other. believe it or not when American idol is done for the year I miss it. Even though this was not American idol I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back on.|1
"Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: ""go to hell."" thanks. it had to be said!"|1
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic.|1
"A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie . 75+ % entertainment . Casey , Buddy , Kelly Marsh , and the great family movie . I will be back to check out the horses in the next couple days so look for that . . . . . and I will share more when I find the time . . . . . . ..

I hope you enjoyed the pictures I got today. I was up until 2:45am this morning taking pictures for a family that just moved here from Chicago and had a big scare. I got some nice pictures."|0
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead . There are ghosts and apparitions in the world of the living but there is a gap in the world where no-one really exists. This is the essence of ghosts, which are entities who are not seen or known by any other being. The film is about whether or not you believe in ghosts, if they are real or not and whether or not it's possible you might see one. The characters are a young boy with autism and a female teacher.|0
"**May Contain Spoilers**The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced ""dee-SAYd"") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant ""Nubian"" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME."|1
"I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. But when I saw the beginning credits, I said ""oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan who used to star on my favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put on a few pounds but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. too bad I didn't sick around to see her in the film. I bailed out 20 minutes into he film."|1
This film is a cash in . A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier film, this film had a much less ambitious plot than its predecessors, which were all about a group of teens being forced to do things against their wills for their parents. However, the themes of bullying, bullying and violence are present in the film, which I think is really good. The only thing that really stops this film from getting any more attention is the fact that there’s not enough of a plot. The movie is a bit slow and not really exciting.|0
This movie was trying to something , but failed miserably . All the attempts at suspense were cheap , and it was just as bad as the trailer said . I don't even know why I bothered watching it . If it was something I wanted , I wouldn't have wasted money on it and I would have just watched it . If it was worth watching at all , I guess I would have just bought the DVD and not bothered with a movie . I don't know why I even watched it. I just didn't like it and I don't even know why.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it.|1
I was n't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a book, but I was willing to give this one a shot. The plot starts with the theft of the book and how the book ends up getting into a girl's home and turning the entire neighborhood upside down. This is really the only part that was really hard to follow, as I was reading the story in sequence and the events kept happening on my head. I have to admit that I did not like it that much at all.|0
This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I'd never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction.Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I'd fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't. She no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination.The movie has some cute moments.|1
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost ca n't help but be a rather depressing read. After all, we really have no idea how it would feel to just stop taking a drug. That's something I don't get. But I guess it doesn't have to be as bleak as you may think. There are actually a few positives to the book. The first and foremost thing is that Down To The Bone is the first book in a series. That being said, I really like the book so far.|0
"The thing which makes `` Fire '' even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry , is its animation style. This animation seems to be inspired by the style used in cartoons such as ""Astro Boy"", as well as anime such as ''Western animation'' (see for example: ''Sonic Adventure'' ). However, in the case of ''Berserk'' this style does not have the same impact as in most other anime. This anime has a couple of unique visual styles that make it different from all anime to watch."|0
If you think it 's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with , then I can guarantee you the most beautiful person you have ever met in your entire life is also in love with you. So to me , it makes perfect sense. After all if the person you 're in love with is a perfect match , then it 's a good match. I mean, at least you get to spend your entire time with this perfect person and still have time to get your shit together. But I digress. So to me, I have no idea what this guy looks like.|0
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. The leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. So, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to Iraq war and Black Water Company.What a load of leftest excrement!|1
Nothing about this movie is any good . It 's a formulaic predictable `` romantic comedy '' geared to make people want to watch this movie to the end. It 's not that bad but it 's nothing I could really like . Nothing about it is really interesting. A lot of the actors that were in the movie give very little to the movie. Some of the story line is very well done but nothing really makes you care about any characters. Some scenes don't make any sense and other scenes really make you want to cry. It 's just not something that I would recommend to anyone .|0
Marked for Death ( 1990 ) spends more time on action sequences , than it does with focusing on its plot. There is, as always, more to be said about the movie than just ‘what is going on’. It is interesting that it is a film from the 90s. The time and place make it seem that way. It seems a bit retro. However, there is more to the film than just retro. It is the story of a man who returns from the dead. It is, in fact, set in the 90s.|0
I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. I am 35 and he is 17. He liked it and I did too. It still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on TV. But obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would have continued for all the seasons.|1
"Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat."|1
I 'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one . I find these films to be so incredibly boring and nothing that I would watch over and over again. What a waste of money. I hope I never have to waste money like this again but I hope they come out with something better . It was really a shame to see it go down as I really liked this movie . I wish they would put out a remake of this and put it out as my favorite zombie movie. I really enjoyed this movie.|0
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. The issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).I also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable.|1
"""The Cave"" got released more or less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk."|1
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams , back in the early days of cable. My wife and I were driving back from a weekend in San Francisco when we spotted a billboard for “Sixty Minutes” which was the name of an entertainment news program on our local cable TV station. My wife was in the back seat of my car and I sat in the front seat, which was on the back bumper. I flipped over the radio dial and the show I was watching began to play.|0
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. The direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.Spy Vs Spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.Even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.I got half way through and switched off - completely bored.|1
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on , who I liked very much. When I saw it, my thoughts went to the same place they had a moment earlier in the movie, as if I were watching it with someone else, because I couldn't figure out what to do. And as if I were watching it with a friend. I'd like to say I was being a jerk, I'd like to say I was making it up. But, I'm not.|0
This is probably the only film I 've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are the same, and that makes it even more surprising. I'm not sure what is going on but I found the film really enjoyable. The acting was fine, but that didn't matter much to me. I like the music and sound effects too, and that was probably the main reason for me liking the film a bit. The story line of this film follows an ex-military who is currently working for an environmental organization.|0
What is this!! its so bad. The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. I sat through all of this film an then at the end I was annoyed when I realised I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD? A girl got shot?! What is up with that, it was just a stupid film.|1
Not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.While the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn't help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better.|1
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart , and I just knew that I had to see this movie. I think this is a pretty solid film, and I think it would be worth watching just for the performance of Michael Cera. I think the film is great, and I think that I will definitely be looking for it on VOD, so if you guys have any links to it on VOD that you think I can check out and see the film, please let me know! I’m always looking for good content to watch.|0
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124 . It is an urban channel . There is a lot of talk about it . You can watch it but you need a paid subscription . A lot of bad actors are going to show up . Some of the people in there aren't human beings they are robots. The channel 124 is one such place. It's one such place. There's a lot of people there . There's people there . You are going to see these people with the robots . You are going to see it .|0
"I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . A little more of a realism would be needed in it

I like JAG just because it is a little different, and a lot of the same plot elements are found in the movie. The story and the first few minutes, that is. Also, as far as i know that JAG is not a true remake, although some of the effects do match up with what the movie was. It's a pretty good movie, but it´s not a masterpiece."|0
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie 's not even over yet . In fact , I’m writing it just for today. I saw this film the other night , and I still remember the first time I saw the movie , I was like a kid in the first grade who had seen ‘Dil Chholao’ for the first time. And I loved ‘Dil Chholao’ , I just knew it would be the movie that would carry me through the years. And in my mind I can see myself watching this movie . So what did you think ?|0
"Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterion's ""Monsters & Madmen"" set), director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!"|1
This has to be the worst movie i 've seen this year .. and i watch a lot of cable news .. but I'm going to have to give this one a miss because I've been watching The Bachelor for the past 5 weeks and have not seen any new episodes of it.. The Bachelor is the best show. If you're looking for a good show, there's no better one. It has a beautiful cast, great stories and the best judges. I'm hoping the season finale is on soon because it's a really good way to end it.|0
I am very open minded . I watch all kinds of programs to the end ... good or bad ... they are not important for me ... I am always looking for new information . I enjoy reading, reading books . I am a newbie in computers . I have learned a lot from my parents ... it will take time ... I want my daughter to have a happy childhood and learn lots of things for her future . I want to bring a smile to her face ... she will be a good wife .... so I have to do this . I am very independent.|0
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls.|1
"I love these awful 80's summer camp movies. The best part about ""Party Camp"" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak batch of ""characters"" into a location and then things occasionally happen. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman."|1
Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping. Were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy. Most of the cast are content to simply phone it in, and don't really seem to care about the film in the least. The writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the name of the actors that respectively play them. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old REALLY quick. Even the late great character actor, Brion James can't save this stinker.|1
"Trite and tiring , the one-liners almost made me cry . My 4 year old left the room and ended up yelling at me for a while. When I asked if I could read, I think the child was really angry and wanted to keep reading so I could get even more done. After the kid left the room, the teacher asked, ""Well, what should I read?"" ""Let's read from the Bible!"" was my response. The teacher was surprised and said, ""If you like Bible, you will like this one."""|0
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film. For the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. It seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. Also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. Perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid.|1
To paraphrase Thora Birch : `` I kind of like this movie . It 's the exact opposite of everything I like about horror films . '' But it's not a bad movie, and it's not a classic horror film. It's exactly what it should be, and it's far from the first time that the subject of haunted houses came to the forefront of a horror film. In fact, it happened so often, that the very first film of its kind is considered to be a classic, in its own unique way.|0
I would say this is a background movie. Play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). I thought this was a film that was done before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The screenplay/script is pretty awful. I love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. Ughh. It almost seems like it's a made for TV movie based on the cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? Even the secretary breaks out into song.|1
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly.|1
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best. I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie.|1
I found the Movie very interesting . I really enjoyed the film the actors were great . It was entertainment . The plot was very interesting and the cast was great . I can recommend this film to all to watch . It was nice . I think that if you look at the movie I don't think you will find that many other movies are like it . I didn't think anyone could make such a funny story . The music was great and the actors were good . It is a film for all ages because the actors are kids with no experience like the adults .|0
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas, the roistering, free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries.|1
Buyer beware . The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description . The movie was shot in color and looks amazing . I bought it for $13.99 . The movie came with a DVD and Blu-ray , but I think I got the Blu-ray and DVD from Amazon for $9.00 . The movie looks good, but it looks terrible on the disc . It looks like something was shot on the disc . There's a bunch of watermarks . The picture is grainy. I don't care for it , but the movie looks good from the description .|0
Once again , Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load . It has humour ( `` You 're all wrong'') and a very interesting plot and it makes you laugh and think. In a world where everyone is on the same wavelength , it has more than its share of oddities and I could go on and on about it , but for now let me just say that this is very good, very well written and very entertaining. I have watched the entire episode and I think it is brilliant , with good performances and lots of great jokes.|0
"I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or David Arquette's ""performance"". It was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER!!!!)."|1
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer on Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, ""From A to Zzzzzzzzz."" The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to ""civilize the savages"" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something."|1
This is the worst of the toxie series by far. The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. Like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. Why is this film made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. There's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop.|1
This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do.|1
Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience.|1
I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed dull to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor.|1
From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again. This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema.The story is needlessly told in flashback style. All of the 'present' sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. I never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.The story self also isn't exactly the greatest. It isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell.|1
I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank's Place.|1
That's all I can really say about this film. It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series. The action is pretty nice in general. The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Pretty good in general, there... The problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff.|1
"Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career, spanning over 300 movies. While few (if any) would call him great, his films' obscure connections to underground culture (via reference, tribute, or influence) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films (""Piranha"", ""Humanoids from the Deep"", ""The Black Scorpion"", etc. ), without improving on them in the slightest."|1
"Throughout watching `` End of Days '' , I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to create a feel-good movie to help sell the DVD release, but I was disappointed that they seemed to miss their mark in their storytelling skills. I mean, while I have seen and seen and seen, I am never going to say I ""liked 'em or ""didn't like them"". While I have never really seen this movie, I have watched a few of the trailers and the opening and closing scenes. I am not so familiar with the plot and all of it is very cryptic."|0

River's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one. Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.|1
I 'm not a movie snob . I 've liked lots of movies that critics hate , and I 've had a few. But I was a film buff growing up, so you don 't hear about me saying this , but I 'm a film lover . As a movie lover , I can get into the mood of the movie as well as the characters , the setting and all that . It is a good thing . And I 'm glad I got to see it , even though I know I 'll probably not remember every little thing about it .|0
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan 's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ramcharan fan, it seems he is being used as an actor to do his job. As I always say, good actor should do the role of hero , but he doesn't really have a role to play . If you ask me, the role has not been written in such a way so that it's easy for a person who is not an actor to handle. It's a character that's created by someone else in a different way.|0
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside . The world isn't a reflection of what we are. You can still be good at everything and be beautiful. Just know what you're capable of, and know that what you do is beautiful. You can have everything. I agree, I don't understand how these girls can get so insecure about themselves. They are so vain and insecure. I've been in the business for a long time. In the beginning I was insecure about my looks.|0
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. He meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. The group which is called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene.|1
I really do n't know much about the Marquis de Sade , not having read any of his book , so I was wondering is there any evidence that he killed himself? Is there any evidence to suggest he killed himself? No, because suicide is not an act of will, it is an act of the will, which is simply the result of a mental illness. Sade did not have this illness. He killed himself, and is dead. I don't see any evidence that he murdered himself, either. There are all sorts of things you can say about it, which are all false.|0
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That 's reason enough for me to recommend the movie. It's definitely worth seeing, even if it's on a small screen - the cinematography is very well done. It's worth it for the acting, especially Laura's (which is great, in this case) and a couple of other small bits. Not only that but there's a great soundtrack to listen to during the movie as well as a great visual to view.|0
Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - but then, why would anyone do a sequel to the original ? I was a fan back in the day , I got to see it twice , and I must say that it is quite well-done , not only that , but there is an intriguing story to follow , so if you've been looking for it, look no further, it's here, there's no point in wasting your time on this one , unless perhaps you are a fan of the series.|0
If this movie had been directed by a man , he would have been jailed . While Adrian Lyne was a fine actor , he couldn’t hold a job for very long . So , the director , Michael Curtiz , had to make the best decision for himself , and he took his own daughter to work with him . But , her friend , Anne Baxter , was pregnant and had to return home to have her baby . Michael took the child , and raised him . He later married , but , their marriage was a total disaster . The movie is about the couple and their son .|0
This film works on a lot of different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch it I'm not sure who to go call first--my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue.|1
"I agree with msinabottle ; this is a great movie . Here are some dialogue snippets : Raisuli ( Sean Connery ) says "" I am going to tell you something, the truth. I'm not saying it because I think it's funny , but I'm going to say it to you to help you to understand, I am not here for the money or the glory. I'm here to do something that you should have done a long time ago. You know that you should have done something about it. I am not telling you anything because I think you ought to do something."|0
"The inspiration for the `` Naked Gun '' movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy in movies - in a different role. The director wanted to see him in a smaller role and was initially concerned he would be playing an older character. As it turned out, his new movie was so successful that the director gave up on trying to get Nielsen to do a movie and started looking for someone else who could do the movie. In the end, it didn't take long to get him back to work, and the result was "" The Naked Gun : The First 50!"|0
"This amusing , sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940 's and 1950 's stars Robert Mitchum and Lee Marvin, as well as stars of the earlier genres of the 1940s , such as John Garfield, William Holden, and William Powell . Written by , , the book was adapted from a novel by . The book won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Drama . As a boy, Robert Mitchum would play his father and mother in a movie called ""The Lonesome Pine"" . He was a star in the motion picture era , but as a boy, he didn't understand why."|0
This is a very strange film , with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. So let's take a look at this film to see if I've been completely wrong or if there is some new info that was overlooked. The story is told from the point of view of four different characters in a train station in London. The first three tell stories from different perspectives about what they have gone through, while the fourth is the train driver's story. The story begins in the 1980s in London, as the city is experiencing a downturn in population and tourism due to the war.|0
"This movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science. There were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.People with expectations of seeing a ""pretty war"" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.War is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song."|1
While this is horribly dated, I MUST insist...PLEASE, NO REMAKE! Frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.The novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. I'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what I mean.|1
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really wish I had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh.|1
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his films and it's great to see him out there, even if in a new role . It's a pleasure to see him back in a new role . But what is really important is that he will be back to work after being out for so many years . This has to be seen by people who are used to seeing that he is one of the biggest stars in cinema today and he will continue to make good movies and good films .|0
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews . This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is absolutely awful. It was made to appeal to kids, and you really had to see the DVD to understand what was wrong with it. I will not go into details, but there are a lot of errors, a lot of unnecessary scenes, and the actors are terrible. It's hard to watch, and you really have to see it in order to understand the movie. If you're looking for something that will entertain your kids, pick something else.|0
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3 . It 's surprising that equal distribution of film and video is so undervalued. I'm curious to see what you think and what it takes to get it seen by so many. What's your favorite film and what's your favorite movie of this decade? I'm not sure I agree with the first part. I think this film is pretty good. I just don't like the ending. But I did enjoy it, I had a good time, and the only reason I disliked it is that the ending is so abrupt.|0
I 've seen some Bible-based trash . This one tops it all . To make matters worse , it lasts for 24 hrs. I think it will last longer , but I guess you can always try it . If this one isn't the best you will find , try out the others that I 've posted and see if it makes you happier . You will probably be able to find one for less than this one , but some of them are more expensive . Anyway , you can always find some for less than this one .|0
"Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. ""Scene Of The Crime"" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre."|1
As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon.|1
Very odd , this seems like a very average movie to me , if not slightly less . It is very odd that the main character gets a new girlfriend , they don't know what is wrong with the first one . A lot of movies seem to start off with a very good girl becoming a bad girl but this just seems like they start from a bad situation . I agree , I have a friend that has been in a serious relationship with a woman he has known for a long time , They have been together for a while and there's no trouble on that side .|0
Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called `` Half Empty . '' I usually go out to see films with friends, but this was my first trip to the theater, so I was really excited about seeing this particular movie. I had not been to the movies in a while, as my son had moved out and was living in Austin for the past few years. When we got off the elevator in the theater, I walked up to the theater and was immediately overwhelmed with how big it was. There were at least six screens, and the place was packed full.|0
Once again , Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people . This time the traveling circus put a little man trap in it . And now . . . The circus is back in town and this time it is a real circus ! They want to be famous ! I am not going to waste my money on a circus , just as they are not going to waste on me , so they should pay attention and make an effort . I think I can make a living at it . If this doesn't get a lot of publicity , I am afraid they may find themselves with no circus anywhere in town .|0
I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a flea market in South Africa which was packed with films like this. This is an excellent film made by an English film maker who is the director of the upcoming film “Atonement” that he was working on. The film is based on a novel that I am sure has never been made before. Here are some reviews I have from people I know who have seen it before. So far I have had people telling me how much they liked it.|0
"I 've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra 's music , and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life and times , which you can find here if you're interested , and it's been pretty well received (I can't say the same about other terms, though , so I'm pretty happy about that)

I actually had the opportunity to go to his home town, New Jersey , with his brother , who told me the story of Frank having to be taken from the stage to a hospital bed after suffering a severe stroke ."|0
Watched the director 's cut last night ... glad it was free rental , even a dollar would have been good. The film was shot in 4k and was shot in a 4k cinema. The film was shot using a Canon 7D and that is a good camera for this movie, the only issue is the lens. This is the first time I've seen a movie with a wide angle lens in a theater. The movie was shot using the Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L Lens. I don't think this lens will work with a theater screen unless you get a wide angle view.|0
I hate to admit it , but they were right to sack Schrader . The opportunity is here to build a long term relationship , which I believe is what he wants, not to bring in more money. I can see a few more players who will fit Schrader mold and be a nice upgrade to the offense, as long as the coaches continue to make him a part of their plans , and I hope he realizes this. I think that he has a legitimate chance to make a difference in the future of our franchise if he is allowed to be involved.|0
"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep."|1
This is most likely the best picture not many will see . It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. I have seen this picture before. What makes it so great? Well, it was shot in the 70's and the movie is set in the 50's with the characters being middle aged (though, it would be surprising to see them in their 30s), so that is quite good. The cinematography is well done as well and the cinematography of the 70's movie era is quite nice to look back on, though, a bit dated now.|0
"Well, this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a ""master of commercial suspense"" or maybe a ""compulsive technician"" -- or was he really ""deep."" Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at his best, he could not have been all three things at once.In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit."|1
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Sure it moved a bit slow at times. I liked it.As far as MST3K goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker for example.Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously.|1
"The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. In fact the main character (Pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film I've even seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with ""Black Orpheus"") and have never forgotten it. I don't think I ever want to see it again--it was just too much."|1
"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"".The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins."|1
I 'm a big fan of surrealist art , but this film by Bunuel ( with some ideas from Dali ) is an exception. It's an extremely surreal film, but as you probably already guessed this is based on a true story . It's a well-written film, with a great cast and excellent direction . This is a story about a man who, after the death of his father, sets off to found a family . In the process of creating this film , it took a long time because it was a project that Bunuel started years ago and it had to be adapted into film.|0
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film.|1
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men , which he perfected in the TV series for the past eight years. I think he deserves to be in his own movie. He’s going to be a star. He won a Tony Award for his role as the titular character, as well as other awards, including a Best Actor Tony. He’s one of the few actors I can think of that doesn’t really need a lot of publicity. I think he’s great. He’s not a star.|0
I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations.|1
"I could not believe what i saw ... ( once ) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should have never made it ... I mean they were not really in this for money they are actually doing it out of love …

In the end, it was too late. I had to leave early. I was on the third floor. I did not have a chance to speak with him. I could tell from the way he was dressed that he was a policeman and was probably a part of the C.I.A. or possibly the FBI."|0
I totally agree . This is `` Pitch Black underground '' and a well worn plot . The best scenes are from the first episode when she goes out for a walk and she goes into a bar. The only thing that could be better is if we could see some more scenes of her being a mother to a child . It was really nice seeing her and her family. I really liked this series. I am very excited to see how the story is going to continue . I also think it is a good example of how much a fan-favorite could get the show to be more mature and realistic .|0
How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary!|1
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lays as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride.|1
This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. As a grad '83 boymyself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times atRidgemont High )stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; thevapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are allrepresented here.I have seen this over ten times now. The music in the film was topnotch. Unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx orLoverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out recordsand tapes (it was the 80's after all !)|1
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy night. This is a classic American made for TV movie. This is just one of those classic American made for TV movies from the 70s. The only real difference between this and other versions of this is this is in colour. You can see a few of those in my youtube channel. I would recommend trying to catch this one if you have not already seen it before. I would also advise watching it with your kids.|0
Mankind 's Self awakening is the theme of `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' , a process that unfolds over decades and unfolds in different ways at different times (e.g. in different cultures). The process seems to develop over generations, from infancy through youth to old age. What is most striking is that this process does not simply happen; it is not the result of one single individual or even of one single individual's actions, but is the result of the interactions of individuals over generations. Even if this is the most striking result, however, the more fundamental question is how the process unfolds?|0
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. Thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare I say....jolly good cinema. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood.|1
"Let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...I mean a ""truly"" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. I admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And although I'm giving this film a 1, I highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: Aussie Park Boyz."|1
Some movies you watch and you say , `` Well , that made no sense . '' And you do the same to all of the people on the other end of the line. And they say , `` Huh ? I didn't get that . . . did you see ? '' And you say , `` That wasn't . . . it was . . . ? '' And they say , `` Yes , but we got it ! . . . '' And you say , `` I know it wasn't right . . .|0
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism . After all , Funimation will have at least several of the titles I've been waiting to see. Sadly I'm not too excited about all of it. I mean , who doesn't like The Big Lebowski or The Devil Wears Prada ? Or any other film that gets me excited just because it's so damn good. But you know what , there are a few I'm sure I'll have at least one of the first three films I'll see.|0
"The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. She realizes that she can ""feel"" and ""see the real world""."|1
Like a lot of the comments above me, also I though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as I will explain a in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking.|1
"""Delusion"" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. The film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's B-movie diva Rubin's even performance. Don't waste your time on this turkey."|1
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development.|1
I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was no fun at all. I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way.|1
This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen . It shows what us what life is really really like and I am a very emotional viewer . The characters are very realistic . You can’t get bored watching it . I would recommend it to anyone , young or old . The film opens on a young boy in his twenties who has been diagnosed with autism . We then follow this boy as he becomes an autistic person in his own life , his mother is a teacher of autistic children, his father is an unemployed engineer .|0
I 'm a Petty Officer 1st Class ( E-6 ) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and have been to many places in my career. It's my job to know the places where we can go out and meet other USCG crews and do our job. I have always been interested in doing that because we do so many different jobs and I'm always excited to get out there. I've spent my first 6 years in the Marine Corp where I was assigned to the S.C.A.R.S. ( Sea Cadet Anti-Reflection System Patrol ). The S.C.A.R.S.|0
Something not-so-great . `` Silence of the Lambs '' remains Demme 's only good film , and I 'm of that ilk . The story is so over-the-top farce it can 't be appreciated, let alone enjoyed . Yet, it is well worth your time . And the special effects are outstanding . The film is a horror story that should appeal to those who enjoy the genre : it 's not your run-of-'the-mill spook 's-n-scary story . This is a movie that deserves the widest theatrical release with the widest release it can 't be shown anywhere . And that 's not bad for a low budget horror flick .|0
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson . You owe it to yourself to invest in a copy and see what you think. I don't have a copy of Underworld USA but it does seem to be an adaptation and I would think that the acting and some of the storyline would match up nicely with what we see in Underworld. It is a good movie with some really nice action sequences. But as a fan of Underworld I know it can be overrated and I don't recommend it.|0
Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them . Whilst shamelessly copying their music, and making it sound like it was written in their home town of Manchester, there was some very good stuff on the EP. But I don’t know that I’d pay £7.50 a pop for any of the songs. “We want to take the time to do this, and we are really keen to work with the fans as a whole to create an album that will be for the masses. But we want to be transparent and honest with the fan as well.|0
This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. It stars an incredible cast of characters who make you care more for the characters than the acting, making this an action packed, fast moving thriller. This is the second film I’ve watched with my dad and my brother. We both enjoyed it. I don’t have any spoilers for this review as I’m not entirely sure how it’s supposed to work since there are a number of subplots I’m not going to comment on.|0
An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants . At the time, the play was so well written that it earned an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. That's because it's so good, it was nominated, but lost to the other Oscar-snubbed melodrama The Best Years Of Our Lives. This is a terrific piece of screenwriting, so much so that when Francis won an Emmy in 2000 (for the original screenplay of Love Actually), her work was celebrated as much as her work on the show.|0
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for worst film of all time. A phony looking giant vulture attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. It's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, ""It Came From Hollywood,"" where this gem is hammered for the line, 'A Bird As Big As A Battleship', with gleeful, endless needling."|1
Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career , spanning over 300 movies . While his work remains a staple on the silver screen , one of his most celebrated projects is The Goonies ( 1985 ) , directed by John Hughes . The film was made in the time of the 1980s , during which a new wave of American and British independent filmmakers was taking over the silver screen . While the style was a departure from the traditional slasher sub-genre , The Goonies was one of a number of movies made during the era that made the horror genre as popular as it is in today’s climate .|0
Think 'Charmed ' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture . A very masculine look. I have been obsessed with this picture from the beginning, because I feel like that is exactly what the world needs, right now, right? I think you can all agree with me, that it would make a wonderful book cover. This isn't even my first attempt at the look and I really want it to be one of the more successful books in the genre. I'm very much looking forward to working on it.|0
It 's hard and I did n't expect it ... But it 's really the worst film , me and my family were really excited ... I really hope they'll change something ... but I 'll give this a try , it 's good that it's here in the theaters and not on the Internet ... and if it 's not so much like the movie that I hoped for , I 'll still give it a shot , and I 'd like to see the ending of the film too, but I won't spoil it. I 'm also still not quite sure if it 's a good film or not.|0
Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the dialog. And the music was nothing great. Anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. And what does a Kansas teen know about shopping in Soho....couldn't we have had a better line here?|1
What a dreadful movie. The effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. The acting was awful and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and run for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make Ms Green look to unfit).|1
I've seen all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.|1
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fast forward was I able to make it through the first 2 hours. The write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but I didn't see much of either. If it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt that I will watch the rest without a recommendation.This review is supposed to be without spoilers so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic.|1
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD by it's cover. I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. The music was pretty ordinary.|1
I realise it's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a Charleton Heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better.The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-Pharoh like. The acting really wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one.|1
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style.|1
A recent re-issue of the French crime film ( original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes ' ) , with an English version following soon, contains an interesting scene that takes up about five pages of screen time, and a few lines in the opening credits at the end. I'm not sure I understand the reference, or what the scene is referring to, as I can't recall the line that goes with it, but I'm a bit intrigued. I'd appreciate any thoughts or suggestions on this, or anything else this might be referencing, since I've always found it a bit odd and confusing.|0
Steven Segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme's. Has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! I mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief.|1
* * Spoiler * It gives away the very irrelevant ending * * At the beginning of this movie , there was a moment where the film's main character was shot. I found that a bit too obvious. Also, the ending gave away an ending. 1. This is an adaptation of some kind or another. 2. The title refers to the fact that the hero is a child of the late, very rich and famous James Bond franchise, one of the most popular characters in modern times. The title also implies a kind of innocence and naivety. 4.|0
"OK, so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? ""SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH"". I thinking it has to be an older horror movie, because there's noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after The blockbuster hit ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original. That alone should have stopped me from putting it into the V.C.R."|1
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would've vomited, so I don't want you to either. I'm giving this film a 5 because I thought it was pretty good, I like that a lot of the actors have good lines and the direction of the movie and the art work was really good too. I liked the acting as well as the cinematography. However, if I have to choose, I'd give this a 3 because it's quite slow to begin with and the ending was a little bit rushed.|0
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We'd 100% recommend it, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen, and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did.The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast.|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike & his mate decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? Well, things backfire when Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of Sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament.|1
"If you came here , it 's because you 've already seen this film and were curious what others had seen so far. Well , here you can see all the reviews so far and how the film did. 1. ""A Girl and Her Pig""

In this film, the protagonist, Astrid, is left alone in her apartment when her mother is out of town. So Astrid gets bored and tries writing a poem. One day Astrid is in a bar, talking with a guy, and the guy is trying to make a joke about being a writer."|0
This movie was so poorly acted. What was with Jeff Bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian?The script was lame. To have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the Jeff Bridges character...are you kidding me? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. Do these people just not believe in calling the cops? Okay...I'll get into the car with you, why not? DUH!|1

Well , to each his own , but I thought Gibson 's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever seen , and yet it made me laugh. Hilarious . I can't stand Shakespeare , I can't stand any of it. Now if we're talking about a good movie, I think it's Hamlet. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's better than the original. I'm an avid Shakespeare fan , but I think most of the films I can remember are horrible. I like both versions of Hamlet.|0
"Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable, and overacted. This movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of ""pee -wee"" sports.Characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.Did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.Typical ""Mafia"" behavior was boring and stereotypical.The dog, however, was so darn cute!!! !"|1
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman , I had to see the movie . I enjoyed every minute of it . The director of the movie was very talented . The music score was a nice touch . There were a few actors in the cast who I liked . The film has no bad actors or actors in it . It is very funny . It really is one of the best romantic comedies of 2010 . You will enjoy this movie . You should watch this movie and watch it again and again . Don't you just love her ? Don't you just love her .|0
The girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. What I'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. Lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. And if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: They are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion.|1
Why bother , ITV ? Admittedly , Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to `` get , `` but by the end you feel that you ``ve read it for yourself and that the author had some hand here , too. The problem is that you ''ve lost your `` way `` and you ''ve fallen back into what you know . That is why I am not surprised that they have not released this as an audio-book . The author is a genius . Mansfield Park ( , ) was first published in 1939 and has been described as a masterpiece of the period.|0
Ken Burns ' `` Baseball '' is a decent documentary ... it presents a clear origin of the game , and the history of American baseball. However, it isn 't a good film. There is no baseball player that plays on the game in this film. It is a fictional biography, and is based on the popular book '' ''A Day at the Baseball Field: The True Story of The Game that Changed America''. It was written by the journalist , and it has been made into a TV series . The TV series will air on ABC.|0
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he has been investigating Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans.|1
"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now""."|1
This film could have been great- but was n't . Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the dead on this list, the one thing I'm sad to see pass away is John Carpenter. Not that he didn't deserve any accolades - he was probably one of the finest and most prolific horror directors out there. I don't think any of you could tell the difference between a horror director and a horror film- and so I'm not about to tell you. But he did make a few good horror films - and he made his own horror films.|0
From the makers of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a BIG deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). A twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named Vivian is currently residing in Romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in America for being werewolves.|1
Please...if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it... do not waste your time!!!! I too watched this film right after finishing the book, and was seriously disappointed... the main character is basically a new made up Fanny, for she shows NO resemblance whatso ever to the book...she's so lively and laughing all the time... if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy, introverted character.... please!!!!!|1
This thing , directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien , is worst than all the turkeys that you may have in your face. In fact, the film seems to be a tribute to the film “A Christmas Story” , starring Johnny Depp. The title of the film, which was recently shown at Cannes, was inspired by the Christmas movie. However, what really gives the film its identity is not its plot but the way Sebastien and his collaborators use the elements of that other Christmas movie to build up a whole new story with which to make their movie.|0
"This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic film shot-by-shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. In 1998, ""Good Will Hunting"" director Gus Van Sant tried it by remaking Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho"" and failed miserably. What on earth was Van Sant thinking of? This remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. The few changes that were made here were no help. If you want to see ""Psycho"", the choice is obvious. See the original."|1
I 've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise . A Christmas Classic , it 's not as good as others like it . It was a bit slow in the beginning , the plot wasn't all that believable , but overall a good movie . The characters were good , but not great . This is one that will be on my favorites list , for a long time . A great Christmas movie , it has some great scenes and scenes to remember . I 'll probably watch it again , just because I 've seen it so many times , I can't take it away .|0
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn.|1
If you 're coming to this film to learn something about depression , forget it : you wo n't learn anything, there is nothing to learn, it isn 't worth it. Even when you know what to expect, it isn 't of any use to you. There 's no emotional value to what you do see, and so there 's no point to the film at all, and as soon as we get to the credits and there are no more credits, we're left to wonder : what do you think it is about ?|0
"I am sure I 'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends ) , but I don't like what we are doing. I just hope that it won't be long before people will understand that there is no point to be in this world until you learn to accept the things it offers. In the meantime, I will keep trying to find someone to blame so that I do not have to worry about it. ""How much of your own soul is worth if you have to give it to somebody else?"""|0
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short and make it very simple:

I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but I had no doubt I would enjoy it. I'm not going to get all teary-eyed over how this is bad, but I can't deny it is disappointing, and I'm going to hold my tears until the very end when it hits me. That's the way I want to see this film in the future."|0
If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie ( grumpy ogre , annoying donkey , cute kitty , happy ending ) and made it into a live-action short film, we're guessing that you might have seen a movie that did exactly what you're trying to replicate. So when you went and decided to do the same thing, what would you do? In this article I'll outline what I've found works best so that we can all make better short films. But before we begin I should mention that I do have a bit of a problem with this sort of thing.|0
This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in expecting Blade Runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate.|1
We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is.|1
Once again , I 've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I'll get right into it. I think it's best to discuss the issue from an objective viewpoint. First of all, I'd like to make clear that I've read the movie thoroughly and the review by the person who gave it to me has been very fair and objective. I'll also say that I don't agree with some of his comments in this particular review, but that's not his point in particular, it's that people give bad opinions about movies on a regular basis.|0
Ordinarily , Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys ' - James Stewart , Gary Cooper , Henry Fonda . Now 'the big boys ' are using the western genre to make films for the masses - Robert Redford , Brad Pitt , Clint Eastwood . The western genre is coming back to its glory days with a new generation of producers who are determined to bring back the form . One of those producers is Tim Moore , who , with his production outfit, FilmStruck, will be producing several new westerns that are directed by 'The Big Country' directors Tim Miller and Tim Sutton .|0
Although I saw this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. From what I can make of it, this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers.|1
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal . Such an amazing relationship between parents and sons. Kannanthil is not only a great father, but a great businessman. In an interview with a local daily, he had said that he was not the only son of his in law, who had joined the army and was serving as a corporal in a company in the military . He added that if the company wanted him to quit his job to join them in his own right, he wouldn’t say anything. So what’s the problem?|0
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age , with the British Empire in its heyday of the second half of the 18th century , from 1805 to 1814, when it was the biggest and most powerful country in the world at that time. But that’s only a part of the story, or rather, part of a very specific story about how things developed in Britain from the late 17th century on. In order to see the ‘whys’ , we have to go back.|0
"`` Rouge '' is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own . It is n't a sequel to the original either, a much darker story than the original. I really enjoyed this one. There are some very dark and disturbing moments , and the ending leaves a lot of questions . I would recommend that you check it out if you have an interest in horror movies . A few notes about the movie:

The story is told from multiple POV points , with many of the characters having very different backgrounds. I really liked how the story is handled ."|0
This movie was pathetically awful. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. This movie totally rips off Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy I should say).I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. I watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. I actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes I do.|1
"I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite classics of all time. I have read quite a few of the author's novels but have never read the original book. So for this post, I am doing my best to give you my thoughts. If you are looking for more than that, you may wish to check out my other reviews here. There are a couple of aspects that stood out to me while watching this movie:

First and foremost, the soundtrack, which I think is amazing."|0
Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots Piper, who dies.|1
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot . I think that it will appeal to fans of The Cave, but only to a small extent. It doesn't seem like it's that much different from the movie, at least with the basic story. Maybe some people will find it funny as much as I did, but I don't have a lot of interest in seeing it, it's just a movie that I don't find that interesting and I don't know what I'm laughing at.|0
"Just awful. It's almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plodding, passionless mishmash could result. But that's television for you -- filler between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the period re-creation, which screams ""1928"" in banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and waistcoats, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) -- with all the attention paid to pointless, arty detail, the important matters get ignored.Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or competent writing and acting."|1

My girlfriend wanted to see this ( lol this is the case a lot ) ... so I rented it, had to watch the show. It was the first time, after watching all of the series, and I really enjoyed it. But, I had to wait an extra 1 hour for it to reair and I thought this was a good reason to keep it around for the next episode. I'm glad I watched it, it is good. I can watch it anytime I want. Maybe next time my boyfriend will let me watch it for free and then I'll go to the theater instead.|0
A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment with her boyfriend. This column is the product of many hours spent at the typewriter in front of her computer, writing down random facts and details of her life. It is written to make the point that she is in fact an average American lady, who happens to have been born and raised in rural Iowa. It is my hope to inspire you to be a better, more positive person by living your life the way you would like to live it.|0
"This movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld either."|1
"This is a very , very odd film ... one that is so odd it 's best you just see it, and then ask the questions, so here you go:







THE JUDGES





In this film I tried to be funny. I'm not going to give too many details ... but it was more of a ""fun"" than a ""serious"" comedy ... in a way it kind of is ... it's funny, but not funny in a way that makes you think. It's funny in the way it's not a film about anything."|0
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose ( http : //imdb.com/title/tt0119590/ ) . The movie was made for children and the plot is a re-hashed version of a story from the Grimm fairy tale. The movie is really good, kids will enjoy this re-make and it won't get old for them. It's a good story that teaches kids about the world. The story was written in the mid 1900s by a French writer called André Gide. The plot was inspired by a classic French fairy tale. He changed the whole story slightly to make it a modern tale.|0

( This is a review of the later English release by Disney , featuring Alison Lohman , Patrick Stewart , Peter Dinklage , Anthony Hopkins , and Michael Gambon . ) Patrick Stewart is so much more than a handsome actor. He can act as well as any actor you’ve seen. He can play a wide variety of roles, from a tough but sensitive cop to an alcoholic rock star. I had the privilege of seeing him, and he was so good that I felt compelled to write this entire review on the spot. I had a great time.|0
This film works on a lot of different levels . It 's a profile of one very cool couple , a man and a woman who have lived through a lot of very different times . They have gone through various hardships but they have survived them . They have managed to maintain a very happy and stable relationship despite the challenges . This is all true and as it turns out , the relationship between them is more than just their two partners . This film is very well written . You feel like you are in love with these characters .|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie . The plot is basically a huge disaster involving a lot of death, mayhem, and destruction. At least it wasn't all destruction. It just wasn't that big of a mess. It was a good film , I thought, but not very good . The cast of characters were well cast and they had a good idea of what they were going to be doing and why they were in the film . I found this movie to be a good movie, I just wish there had been more action and explosions.|0
I'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. I'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because I'll be here for ages if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience.|1
1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. Stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.|1
A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure ( for a lot of people) pieces of art. We do this every year. We’ve collected and studied the best of what was ever thought of, from the early 20th century, through the 1960’s and the first half of the last century. Some of it’s really pretty good, some is just awful. Some pieces we find are amazing, some are bad, but all of them are worth checking out.|0
OhMyGAWD!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named Sherlock that lived in one of their trees. They also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: They don't MAKE shows like this anymore.|1
I went into this movie with an open mind . I had been too lazy to go to the video store and buy a VCR and had no idea if I would like this movie at all. I am very glad I decided to go and I’ve enjoyed it more than anything I’ve seen before . If you like a little romance or drama you should check this out . This movie is just what I’m looking for and I’m glad I went. “It was the early hours of the morning when I awoke and found myself lying in bed.|0
Well , first off , the twins are exactly the same . there is no one is girly and one of the twins is a boy , so this is very much a boy and girl . they look the same, have the same hair color , eyes , and a bit of the same hair as their sister . I do agree they are very different personality and they have grown up together in school , but it's still a little different , I don't have the same exact feeling about them that I would have if they were my own kids .|0
Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero ( Bond ) and villain ( Blofeld ) were too small in stature. This film is the only Bond film where Bond didn’t actually get the chance to become a great 007 ( Bond as he was in previous films, but with much more personality). The Bond in Skyfall is Bond as an ordinary 007, the same 007 in all the other films. The best Bond film so far has to be Quantum of Solace . It is so much more than the simple story of Bond fighting the bad guys.|0
From the crash of the opening theme , `` The Man With the Golden Arm '' is classic 1950 's rock and roll's first major hit with a song that not only reached the Top 20 but stayed atop the Billboard charts for nearly four months in a row. It's now one of the few songs in history to spend a month and a half atop the chart at least twice. It's a record not just of the music's staying power, but of the cultural impact rock and roll had for the next 40 years.|0
"This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her ""Follow Me"" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place."|1
This movie was physically painful to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger ) I have a fear of spiders . It was painful to see spiders , but they made a good point . It doesn't matter what you see , or how far you are away, there is always one. My fear of spiders was not so much that they were a threat , but more that spiders could cause me physical pain. This may be true for everyone , but there are specific circumstances when it is true. I can tell you about an instance .|0
Having loved Stephen King 's novels and short stories for many years , I , like most reviewers , have not read all of them - and even then I have not read most of them all in all genres . This has led to me to believe that there really is not that much out there , and there are many good novels and short stories in each genre that one can read and enjoy. I would just like to see this and I hope to hear from others, so that this blog will be of some help to some .|0
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch , its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really like how the story lines of this show makes me think back and laugh. It also has great music and I love the background effects. It was a great family show. Overall, it’s a great Disney shows that is worth the money to watch and you can’t not watch it. My family loved it. I would recommend to watch it. I will also recommend to everyone to watch it because its a family show.|0
"The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called ""Whites"" win. However, the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between."|1
I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release.

First off , I 'm not a firefighter , but I 'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit ( the one who gets paid $20,000 and gets to fight with some of the best guys in the world ) and we have been fighting this fire for over 20 minutes now !

First off , we 're trying to talk to our fire fighter and tell him that we love him and all of our guys are proud of them and are trying to get everyone back up on the road safely !|0
This is a totally awesome movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler DDP would say; That's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women.|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I 'd be able to relate to this film perfectly . Its an oddity, an oddity in a way, that really does seem like the best film in the world at the time, it was the perfect film for its time but now in hindsight you could see that this was a movie with it's limitations , not a film that could really hold the audience for more than a few minutes , its not for everyone , and maybe its not even that great of a movie .|0
The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except the raptors are just so big! It’s sad, I wish they had made the movie in the middle of the movie as it seemed better to have it end and start the movie in the middle of the thing! But I really wish I’d kept seeing the movie until the very last shot! I think the last shot in this movie is actually the very last shot of the whole film, which I found very cool.|0
Dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no cash Sofia Coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus. The cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b&w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance.Yet there are one or two things to note. Inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots.|1
"One would have expected Hitchcock 's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution . But the latest installment in his filmography, ""Rear Window,"" proves that, for once, his instincts are right . A film with such an iconic status is bound to be a challenge, even to Hitchcock. ""There are films that I don't really like that much, and I find myself thinking, 'Why can't I come up with an idea that works'?"" said Hitchcock, 62, who made his feature directing debut with Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Marked Man (1938)."|0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around . Never has a movie surpassed its box office success with such precision. The success of the first three films has been largely due to the brilliance of Martin Scorsese who is the director who has had the most direct influence over the course of film production in recent years. For those that are interested, the following are some of the most memorable moments of the movie, beginning with the opening sequence of “Pulp Fiction” and ending with the finale of “Shame.” This is just a quick list.|0
"One of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks ' . Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life in Camden Town, Fulham, Harrow & London Road, Ealing & Brixton. Thursday, 6 August 2011

LONDON, August 6, 2011: A man who has not slept for 48 hours and has been on the phone is the reason that London was hit by a very unusual heatwave that began today. It is the hottest heatwave on record. Temperatures across the metropolis rose to 40 degrees Fahrenheit in some parts of the capital."|0
"Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France-we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. Polite, patient, genial. Although my French is testy, I got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the ""old"" terror growers interviewed-esp."|1
"Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. I only watched ""Golden Temple Amazons"" yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers  especially Jess Franco ones  and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences."|1
"Okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but I actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. At the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). This baby falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category to me, and for that alone I would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day."|1
I used to think that it could n't get worse that `` Army of the Dead '' but this load is worse than anything the last two games have ever been. You get the same badness from each side of the map, there is really no way to get it done. You are going to lose the whole map because of it, at some point. So I was quite excited to see how badly the game is going to be, and I'm very happy it didn't end with me getting all those achievements. It's just that it could've.|0
"For those viewers who thought the 1979 film `` Alien '' the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated in space by a female alien was not a success, as it didn’t exactly go in the direction of the filmmakers’ original intention. The film did, however, go into production in 1978 with the goal of being “an adventure movie for boys in the summertime.”

It was not, of course. Instead, it was a film with a male alien protagonist that is, for all intents and purposes, a female."|0
"Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre-""Malcolm in the Middle"" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. It has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed."|1
I 'm going to recommend putting this one in the `` skip it '' pile as well . I was just curious about your opinion on it so I read all your reviews . You are the expert , I'm just doing my own research . I didn't expect that it would be good . I don't think there are any bad reviews on that one . Maybe I'm wrong . This is a very good book, but it is not a perfect book, and some things are just not as described as they need to be .|0
I kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way, but it never happened. As a child, there was no film in my house that touched me that strongly. When I was in middle school, we watched the same movie twice. The second time I saw it, I knew I was going to love it and I loved it. It is one of the greatest movies ever made. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it a special masterpiece of storytelling and cinema.|0
This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else.|1
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha/Mostly Martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here.|1
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. It uses every cliché in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.It is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie.|1
"Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the ""Female Scorpion"" series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. ""Beast Stable"" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before, or after, has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes and filming styles."|1
"Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.While I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, ""Nurse Sherri"" is really not all that bad."|1
Now first let me say I love god awful movies. Especially horror films mainly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 with no pain. But this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. Give me 3 back to back viewings of Manos The Hands of fate or Monster A-go-go over this any day. Avoid this film like the plauge!! Now excuse me while I go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth I had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film.|1
Last year , I fell in love with the Tim Burton 's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to see what the new version had to offer, which led me to purchase the Blu-Ray. I was blown away by how great it is, and now, I was left wanting more. Unfortunately, there isn't enough of it to justify the price. But, the extras are definitely a good deal. They also give you plenty of material to make your own version of Sweeney Todd. There are two bonus features in the collection, which are both good, but one is very short.|0
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. I did enjoy seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert get eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). Jerri Manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy.|1
I cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. I've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. I haven't made a comment on IMDb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. It is a piece of sh*t. The writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager.|1
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's angst ridden self portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish.|1
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism , birds , birds and more birds . Only 1 piranha . Nice . It doesn’t make a dent in the water table . There is enough fish there to eat piranhas . This place is beautiful and clean . If you are in Maracaibo you should definitely come and go there . We went for 2 nights . The restaurant was a good experience . The service is great too . It was a nice hotel and we had the best stay there . If you want to have fun , have a nice time and feel like a king , then this place is great .|0
It 's a talking , trigger happy , alcoholic ASS COP ! I have seen the first and second episodes of these two episodes , the first one where the cop got away with his crimes because the victim was drunk and could not talk to him and the second where the cop is not as stupid as everyone else thinks he is . I hope this is the end of the series. I don't think there is a good ending to this cop series . There is some hope, of course , but for it to work out I think the cop needs to be a little more intelligent in his dealings .|0
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto a boat. Chupacabras exist as a legend, but are actually a real animal, a species of anacondas, on the island of Barbados. They are small mammals that are known for their intelligence and are found in tropical climates. They can be seen all over the Caribbean and North Africa. In the summer, these animals can be found all over the island, especially near water. There they are known for being attracted to water and for feeding on aquatic invertebrates.|0
You'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!|1
"One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way : I was at a screening of a movie and someone in the audience, who was not there to watch it, approached me after the first 15 minutes to congratulate me, and said ""you are the best, my friend, the best"", then he walked away. That is the kind of friend I had at that time. I have been to many of the worst movies, but the best ones I had in my life were the people who came to my house, and stayed there."|0
This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters '' and a '' bad movie '' ending. The story is quite simple and not very complicated. There is no plot so the viewer will be left to see the whole story. In fact you will have no plot but will have a lot of laughs. There is so much comedy that you may even want to sit down and have a good laugh out of it. I have never laughed so much after watching a movie in my life.|0
"whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful ""Chappy"" Sinclair."|1
This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep.|1
Barely came trough the whole movie ... Acting is bad , dialogs are even worse . Felt kinda st00pid 4 some of the dumb things in the story . In fact, a few of my friends were also a little dissapointed by this movie as it was a bit overlong. And it's not bad, but I think people just don't seem to enjoy it much. I would not recommend it for someone that loves action, comedy or horror. Well I have to agree with a lot of the people who have said this.|0
"""Ahh...I didn't order no amazing hit show"".....""We'll you got one"" Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I flicked on the t.v. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate."|1
Yeah, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting as well. The whole worm-looking-thing was really creepy in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] Anyway, lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode,The Good: The parasite thing. Awesome!Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww... <33It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear.|1
"Oh dear ! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this time next year ! I can't wait to see ""The Bill"", I've got a feeling they'll kill them off sooner rather than later, and will surely get them back by the end of the century ! I have seen the trailer for the new Doctor Who, as well as the new episode of The Hobbit and I really do hope that they are right. I have never seen anything like it before."|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears . I guess I’m not used to it. I am sure I’ve watched it before. But I don’t recall the last time. I’ve seen this film twice and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I was hoping for something a little more exciting. I think there are probably a lot of people who enjoyed this movie, and I certainly was one. But, I must say, I just did not care for it enough.|0
I 'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts , nor am I bothered by the cynical , self-righteous stance the hosts take with regards to this matter. I don't care about what they say about this matter , because they don't speak for me (I'm a Christian). What matters to me (and what I consider to be important to me) are the questions that need to be answered, which is this: If God created humans, who are we? If he created the world, who are we? And if he created man, where is his kingdom and where is its purpose?|0
* * May Contain Spoilers * * The main character , a nobleman named Fallon , is stranded on an island for his own safety, until he meets the woman he loves - and learns that she was the woman who murdered his wife and his mother. In the series finale , the show’s lead female character , the mysterious and beautiful girl , who was not seen in the pilot , makes a surprise appearance at the top of a cliff near the beginning of episode 6. It was a completely unexpected scene, and it is not yet known how that girl will be involved with the finale.|0
Jack Higgins ' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into `` one last job '' ( where have you seen that before ? ) , the first part of a series starring John Cairney and John McArdle , who play the new recruit. Higgins is an old-fashioned noir thriller in which the hero gets involved in crime just before he blows up the baddies' hideout with a single shot from a pistol. It is based on a true story. Higgins ' second part takes the hero to a house in a village in West Lothian.|0
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . Be careful about who you see on social media that you think is legitimate or legal. This article has been edited to fix a link that is dead. For those of you who have followed the blog for awhile now, one of the stories I wrote a few years ago had a lot of negative things to say about Facebook. I was not very happy about how Facebook had manipulated and misused my identity and my personal data. I thought it was awful.|0
It may be hard to explain how , but this film is a masterpiece . Perhaps , because i never seen a film like this . This is the second of a three films . This time , it is a story about , who have lost their lives . This time it is a true story . I liked the story , but a few things went wrong . I don't know why , but i just could not get it . This film , it just does not work . If someone is willing , please try to watch this film and give it a chance .|0
Such pain! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. I wouldn't say this straight-to-video South African/Canadian/UK horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. I tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as I couldn't keep my eyes open.|1
I 'm sorry , but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off . Totally implausible (as you have pointed out ). I am also not 100% confident that we'll see a sequel to Apollo 13, at least not in the way that you envision. But, even if we did, we wouldn't be going back in time, because the original movie was just too good to repeat. I don't expect a film to completely recreate it, but I also think that it's not unreasonable to ask for a sequel to make a little more sense.|0
Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories, well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force.|1
Mel Welles , you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman 's Little Shop of Horrors , directs his very first film, in 1982 , and the man has a few more movies lined up , one of which I think is worth checking out . If you have a minute , here's your chance . I'll be on at 2 p.m. EST Monday to discuss my thoughts , so make sure you are tuned in . I want to take you back to the early 1980's , before any of the other movies were being made .|0
This is one of L & H 's shorts most frequently cited as the first `` real '' L & H video and we are delighted that it is included in this excellent collection of L & H video introductions. This is a very unusual short in that it was filmed at a very advanced point of the film-maker's development as he moved towards becoming an ``actor-director '' - this was, after all, a very unusual period of development in both the short film and the film-maker's life, and the film itself was also quite unusual for a short film.|0
This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school , early high school age kids . It is also a film that makes you feel like you are in the middle of a movie , that you’re watching it after school . This movie was made by a bunch of young people who wanted to find a new way to create entertainment . This movie is about a group of teens who want to see a new movie , but they find that the movie they want is very different from the movie they want . So this movie is about how these kids deal with this .|0
"Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want . I’ve always loved the story and characters of Aniplex, but after reading this, I can only say: “That’s awesome!”

Aniplex has been a leader in the animation business for quite a few years now, and they are certainly one to look out for in the anime market. From their debut in 1999, to becoming one of the very first studios to produce original IP in North America, they have managed to do it all."|0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like ""The Others"") but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I was not."|1
"I ca n't remember the series , I believe it may have been `` American Masters '' , but it certainly was a fun series , and the contestants were great ! But I do remember being a little disappointed at the final round , not sure if it was a disappointment to me , but to them as well ! You are the most amazing person I have ever seen ! I hope one day you'll come back and join us

That would be awesome, I have always wanted to see how the Masters is played. But I would like to meet you sometime if you come back."|0
"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie ? This is not a horror film at all, it's a comedy. A good comedy. Like one of those movies where they go back and forth, ""What happens if we both get hit by the car? What happens if we both die? And if we die, we both die ? And if we both die, who dies? And how many of us would it take to make it through a whole film ? And what are we going to die in ?"|0
"You know, this is one of those ""Emperor's New Clothes"" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts. Some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius."|1
I really enjoyed this movie . I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it everytime I watch it . I am always shocked at the violence and the way he uses violence .I think it's quite a powerful film. This review is based on a DVD that I bought in the theater last night (the first time I've watched the film in a theater). The first 15 or so minutes of the film is quite disturbing to watch, then suddenly it starts getting better, and the violence begins to creep into the story at times.|0
Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience.|1
"In his feature film debut ` Yellow , ' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood 's portrayal of Asian-Americans. “Yellow is the story of one of America’s first Asians. It is written by one of America’s first Asians, writer Chris Chan Lee. The screenplay is by Lee and his friend, actor Daniel Wu, who co-created the feature film with Chan Lee.”

In his feature film debut “Yellow,” the author Chris Chan Lee (born June 28, 1965), writes the script, with Daniel Wu (born October 1, 1965), directing and starring in the action-adventure film."|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books , so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was going on the New York Times Bestseller List. I’d heard great reviews and was hoping for a better result. It is, however, easily my favorite book of 2007. I was so excited when I found that it made the list. It is so fun to know I made it. I love the book. But before I get into what makes the book good, let me first talk about how I feel when it was first published, and why I felt it was worthy.|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me , raving about how well it was filmed , the underlying message I get with this is that in order to improve your relationships, you have to do what works for you and not what others expect from you. So as I said , I would love to see this done for a second time to see how things turn out. I’ve had the same friend who recommended this before as a first time viewer , so if anyone can help get this done, please do so.|0
WARNING : PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . Fans of his earlier films like The Fly and Dressed to Kill probably already know how good they are, and will appreciate them for that. Those of us who haven't yet watched them might not realize that they've been sitting around on DVD collecting dust for a while and haven't really gotten much of a chance to see them on the big screen for a few years, and that's a shame. That said, I would highly recommend any of these movies to a film buff like myself.|0
I love this show . It 's clever and very well acted . David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry . It 's hilarious , it 's very funny and very entertaining . I love that there is one character who is constantly on the offensive , who continually tries to outsmart the others and when he finally loses , he comes out looking like the bad guy . This is not to say , David Morse is not the best of actors , I mean he is . The show , as well as I said it 's entertaining and well written , and it has some pretty cool special effects too .|0
I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before.|1
This representation of the popular children 's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch . I know it is supposed to be funny, but it sure as hell is boring . I know this is the type of film that people go to see when it comes out in theatres , but I just can't stand this movie . I would like to see the film for the original story, but the film has nothing to do with the story . The movie is basically about an overweight kid with no self control who just wants to be a good friend to his friend .|0
The story is about a psychic woman , Tory , who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic past. Her life begins to unravel and it seems that something is wrong in her life. There is an old man in town who claims that he has a vision. The lady is determined to solve the mystery and find out what is going on. However, she quickly discovers that her only hope of finding the truth are the other residents of town, who are determined to protect and defend the people they love.|0
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. Apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst.|1
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who ' history as its most incredible year . Everything seemed to click ; a new series, new cast, a new adventure. But there were three big problems with the last episode of Series 6. The first problem was a simple one : what to do. A second problem, however, was equally simple : what to say. “I am not afraid of death, I would rather meet it head on,” Dr. Watson said in the iconic opening to the BBC’s Dr. Who. “I don’t intend to spend my time in fear.|0
* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films , this is not the film that you're looking for and I really don't understand the appeal for it. I don't expect it to be a great movie, but there's certainly a lot of charm to it and I do enjoy a good sports drama. This isn't a very good baseball movie. I won't give you a plot summary. The Good The film does a good job showing baseball, a subject I've always loved, but has never really given me a reason to watch.|0
"Watched this film with an audience of .... 5 in total ! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... I chose Lakshya. The story is well-paced. I thought that it was good for a kids movie and it was interesting for me too ! I am sure I will come back for the second half to watch the movie. 3/11/09 4:55 PM

"""Flashdance"" meets ""Meatballs III"" or maybe it should just be called ""Meatballs IV"". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: ""This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it"". ""Gimme An F"" has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her ""Clueless"" days."|1
This movie had potential . If it had been handled differently . What it needed was a different director . I’m sure he would have made a good film. The script and the actors in the movie needed some work before it got made. We are not sure why they needed it, or how they had the funds to hire a director. We’ve heard the director of the movie was not interested in the project and it seemed like he just wanted to take a break on the movie he’s producing. It may have been due to some personal reasons.|0
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled Haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best.|1
This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem.|1
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it . Based on a true story , this is an incredible film that makes you feel as if you are there , right from the first scene , you are going to get into this film . The story , directed by Tom Holland , follows two men who must deal with a situation in which their lives have been completely taken away , as they make a last ditch attempt to get back on their feet again . In this day and age , it’s a sad reality that millions of people around the world have lost their jobs .|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well I was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. I was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. They just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. I hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this Motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. And they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware Laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people..|1
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it 's not difficult to see why . its plot is a little complicated but the suspense is high and the action is impressive . there is plenty of blood and guts , too , and you know what they can do ; they can really hurt people . and this is one of the best thriller films we have ever seen in the cinema . it starts with a pretty girl , and then it turns into a bloodbath . we meet her , she is very attractive , we can understand why the director decided to shoot this thriller in a small village .|0
What can I say ? ? This movie has it all ... Romance , break-ups , rich kids , punks , good looking boys , super hot girls , big boobs , but most of all it's a good time ! I saw this film a while ago. I have to say the first time it happened to me was in college, while a girl was giving me a hug from behind. She said she felt like I was the only boy on the campus. I don't remember what I said to her, because I was busy kissing her so hard.|0
An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one isn't like any other as it pits pint-size, wild-eyed, psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots.|1
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier.|1
Whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely . The Lone Ranger is not camp , but `` camp `` does not begin to describe the production. The acting is average for the midwest , and the script is not bad but not excellent either. I found myself wishing for a little more depth to the story . It did not seem like the writers could pull out of the quicksand with the characters . I won't spoil the movie by saying where the film goes wrong . It seems to me that most of the blame is laid on the shoulders of the filmmakers .|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I 'm a big fan of the Star Wars universe'. This was one of the most enjoyable movies for me and one of my favorite movies ever. I really like the storyline and the plot. The action was really nice. I do not think there is a great deal of violence or blood which I really liked. I love the characters' personalities and they really did well in every role they got. This was a lot of fun.|0
"Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel , combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés-and-screams. Then there's a giddy ""Whoa!"" from the director as the camera pans up from below. That's it, then? No, not this. That's just a fraction, but there's more-and-that's-a-whole other, a lot more, and the whole thing-the whole movie, the whole film!-is worth it. It's a fun movie and I like it, but the problem with The Cellblock is it doesn't make you laugh. Not even once."|0
Sadly this film lives up to about 1 % of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves us all with the same question - will it ever be released? For some time now, there has been speculation over the possibility of a sequel. The original game had a much lower production budget, which meant more time and more effort was put into the production of the game than was put into the making of a sequel. I can't help but think that in this situation it might be best if the game wasn't allowed to happen.|0
"my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! ""dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes"" and ""dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again."" what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality."|1
This movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store. It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. The actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. The only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. The remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog.|1
"To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. What a great movie!!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actress ""Simran"", what a beauty. Give her an award for best looking someone."|1
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12."|1
You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey.|1
It`s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I`m psychic ?!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time .|1
"""Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters"" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it."|1
My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store . From the cover it looked like it was made in Italy, not in England . I don’t know if I should mention it or not . I just know I am glad I saw this film because this is the film I would have watched on the big screen . You know, I can’t say that I know much about these people. I know that there were some things that the director had to do to get the film to the screen.|0
There are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) Copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns.|1
"As horror films go, ""Rest Stop"", could have been better in many levels. Director/writer John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. Several endings have been included in the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.The idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first."|1
Well Folks , this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however , the additional downside includes poor acting , uninspired and uninspired direction , and the fact that this is straight men's film . the way the story is told , the main characters are portrayed as gay and the other characters are portrayed as bisexuals who are also straight . if the story was about a group of straight people who were all gay then they wouldn't be portrayed as the main characters in the movie , so why do it the other way around ? it is just another way to portray the gay experience .|0
"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense."|1
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.|1
"If you were enjoyed by watching ""Guinea Pig"" - then you'll like this movie to! ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. Actually the effects are not so realistic like in ""Guinea Pig"", but its still pretty gory. ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. After that you'll see fetish sex scenes. And last one is a torture scene."|1
`` Tragic Hero '' is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films , focusing on a young Michael Corleone , played by Leonardo DiCaprio . While Corleone takes center stage in the film , the story is mainly about the power struggles within the crime family as it tries to get rid of a member of the Mafia in order to expand its power . The film , while not being a masterpiece , manages to create some interesting plots and character developments . It is a crime family in New Jersey . It is being run by Tony Montana , an evil man who likes to make deals .|0
"Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching ""Amilie"". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.The story is great and the ending is a bit funny."|1
This movie was absolutely terrible . The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from those that did see it, is that they couldn't get their heads around the fact that it was crap. If they had watched it with their eyes they'd see that it was not. It is difficult for me to review a movie which I had to watch twice. In the second time I had to watch it I couldn't believe I had not been able to enjoy it before, now it is one of those films which, even when watched again, I have to have in my brain.|0
Seriously ! You 've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it . It's just a waste of your time, money and even time on the Internet ! I would have rated it much higher if I'd seen the first two episodes . But this is not even the story that I enjoyed watching it. If I'd have seen the first part , I would have said it was worse than the original film , and much less enjoyable . No, this is not a good movie, just as the first two episodes , but even worse .|0
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's supposed to be a remake or update of ""The One-armed Swordsman"", by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. The script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, ""And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..."" or ""If only I'd known what a heavy price I would have to pay."" Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Sing?"|1
"""Admissions"" is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make her overworked mother not notice, she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the acting is first-rate especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put in great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the ending."|1
A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel `` Waltz into Darkness '' of the writer Cornell Woolrich. The film itself is one of only two of Woolrich's novels to be published since his death in 1996, and the other is `` Last Night's Children. '' After his death, the film adaptation of `` Waltz Into Darkness `` became one of the best movies on the silver screen of all time, not only because Woolrich's character was a real character but because the movie was filmed in such a way that it had the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen in my entire life.|0
If you want to truly experience the magic ( ? ) of Don Dohler , then check out `` Alien 's`` . This is one of my favorite films of the year so far , and the first I've tried to find on VHS. This is one of those rare movies that is really not like any other horror movie you've ever seen before. And it isn't just the plot . There's some really weird imagery and sound, as well . It's really just a strange, weird movie , that you won't understand until you watch it, but you will .|0
Being a former MST3k watcher , even I found this movie unwatchable . The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful characters and the awful plot . The worst performance by the worst actor ever to come out of Hollywood , the worst music in any movie ever . This movie will be a classic of its genre , if not more , then more and more of its genre . A masterpiece of bad acting , bad script , bad plot and awful plot . The movie is too bad for me to really say it any better then it already is . I found the story a bit too predictable to be a good movie .|0
A woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. We also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse.|1
"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this ""movie"" left me stunned in my chair.It's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.This is the worst movie ever."|1
A good story about Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would never have to leave the house. She has her dreams of making a million dollars and being in the best movie ever made. But then she meets a new man named Rusty who wants to help her in the best way. They start dating but soon things turn sour when Rusty thinks he can do better. He wants Rusty to take a leap of faith in order to get what he wants. But will Rusty finally get what he wants?|0
"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said ""wow what a good movie."" Someone actually walked out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough."|1
There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part.|1
I saw Heaven 's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago . Tickets were sold in advance based on pre-order numbers. In the early 90's, the movie had yet to see a release date. Now, it's one of the most successful film of all time . There are few movies with such a strong, passionate, and successful fan base. Heaven 's Gate earned more money and grossed more than any other film released at the time. Even though it had a terrible ending, it still broke box office records, and made the movie theater owners rich.|0
I liked this movie , the second Naruto feature film . I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better . I didn't know that the second film , which I saw , was called . I really liked the one in the snow , and I wish they would make a sequel . Well , the first film was amazing , and the second , well , I think I enjoyed the first more , it was more of an action film , but the sequel had a better feel to it . I really enjoyed both films .|0
I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't.|1
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron , famous lovers? Both of those men, and many others, have been described as “sex symbols in our time”, and it would certainly be interesting to find out where this was first introduced to the general public in England and America. And where was this “first”, and how do these people continue to be so important to the creative industry? Let us explore some of the early and more recent developments in a very interesting area.|0
"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.I also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, ""that was perfect""."|1
"`` Black Vengeance '' is an alternate title for `` Ying hung ho hon '' AKA `` Tragic Hero '' AKA 两人失露 采霜 健身的英雄 '' AKA 个人英雄 '' AKA 英雄的虚假 李桥沙 凤养骤

* Black Vengeance '' is an action adventure game set in an alternate timeline in which Black Vengeance is a legendary hero, the second of many legendary heroes in the video game Black Vengeance. '' It was released for the NES, Atari 2600, and Sega Genesis on July 22, 1991, in North America and in the other regions on August 26, 1991. Black Vengeance'' was published by Activision."|0
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around, or that they are all the same.Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. But more important this is a great film.|1
"I recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about dreadful! Any movie Ed Wood ever put out looks like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as ""These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me"" Classic! The mad 'Jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter."|1
The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations.Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one.|1
"If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demise. ""Rififi"" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision."|1
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.|1
"Okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time ""horror"" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie?"|1
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. Saw is just that.The movie is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility.|1
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom , thinking it would be a good way to start off the year, and then it just got worse than we thought. It started off great, we were in a local park and saw a young boy and his dog walking and laughing. My friend and I were chatting up about what he had been up to the past couple of days and my friend said he was going to go for a swim in that lake by the lake. I was sitting on a bench, enjoying the warm sun, and watching my friend make his move.|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds ( probably left over from the Christmas holiday) started to make their way down the side of the hill, but it was all good as I watched the film and was pleasantly surprised by the strength of the performances. The set is really well done, as is the sound design, and a few shots really capture the majesty and atmosphere of the place. The sound and the sound effects have been designed to complement the performances perfectly.|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title ""The Broken Skull."" Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, ""Evil Dead"" kind of way.Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying ""hunh?"|1

My favorite thing about New Jersey

It's my favorite place to live in America . When I was first moving here from Texas, I was very impressed with all the wonderful places in New Jersey . The beaches, the golf course I have been told, you can golf on . But my favorite thing I've noticed is that New Jersey has the most diverse population of any place in the nation ."|0
I just got back from `` AGS '' . After seeing it , I 'm convinced that no matter how bad I felt about it , I really shouldn 't give a damn. I can't say it was perfect, but it's not a total rip off , and not a total flop. It is still a movie that should be seen in theaters for it to truly be seen in theaters . That said , it is still one of my favorites of this year and one of my all-time favorites. I can't wait for the second season .|0
After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time.|1
Yeah great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's Australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur.|1
This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could take it back where I got it from.|1
"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?)."|1
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.|1
A brash, self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a role obviously tailor-made for him, William Haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. A grade-A scene stealer, Haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents.|1
I am very impressed by the reviews I've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball.|1
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM , so I had the opportunity to see it. The director has a reputation for not being able to do his own voice, so I'm sure he's worked with the actors a bit on the film to get what he needs from them (I can only imagine he's had a few conversations with the actors). The acting isn't great, which is to be expected for a film of this magnitude, but they were the best I've seen all year, which makes me glad I saw it.|0
"Acting 10, Script 1. ""Hurlyburly"" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. Even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ""ain't."|1
There are movies that are so bad , they 're good . Then there 's movies like Rest Stop that are good but the plot is bad , which makes them good ? The end of the day is when we can tell you which movie was good, which was bad and which was somewhere in between . But for this week , we've got a list that tells you which movie was the best and which was the worst . I mean , if you know which movies are the best you can use them , right ? Well , let 's just take a look .|0
This is simply a good ole fashioned western .. not overly complex or long . It does n't deceive itself as to who or what they are, but is still quite entertaining in its own right. I would recommend it . I've seen a few others before that are quite good too . I'd definitely recommend the first one as far as entertainment value . If it's not too far, I think I'd like to give a shot to the second . I'd have to admit I was a little apprehensive about it at first , but its a good one for the money .|0
"UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange , necessitating a meticulous read , visually stunning Modern Australian

The title of the film is Strange. As someone born and bred in Melbourne, Australia, this is an extraordinary film, an extraordinary film. It is also a film that demands a detailed, meticulous reading and is a film that demands a critical rewatch. We talk to the filmmakers themselves about what they mean by Strange and why, and also about what is most interesting about the film and what we can expect."|0
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion 's cage directly over Bugs Bunny 's home , Bugs is not happy. Bugs is angry at the thought that he is not invited to the zoo to play with the animals. At first he thinks that he is being treated like a freak, a freak that is not deserving of the big circus. However, after he learns about the life of the circus and the importance of the life, his anger is transformed into joy. ""I think you'll like it here. Don't you?"""|0
I saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.I thought the little boy in the film was excellent. Mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this film is plain 'weird.' It's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time.|1
I've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast the plot hardly matters. An astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. His body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. But how did they get there? And where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in Maj. John Corcoran's body? IMDb lists the runtime for Night of the Blood Beast at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes?|1
In fact it was awful . The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director . I didn’t even realise that until afterwards. She was always in his face , making it hard for him to direct. Then again , I think this is actually a very good scene . It’s not like she was just doing it in the hope of getting an easy film deal or something. She’s actually very good looking and very talented . She is a talented actress and it’s great that her talent was noticed and rewarded.|0
The film begins in Latvia just after WWI . Being a history teacher , I knew that multinational troops occupied my country. As it is hard to imagine it in our country, I was fascinated to see it happening. After watching this movie for the first time I have been inspired to write my personal story. My personal story tells about my time in Riga. I hope you enjoy reading my story. Thank you so much for your visit and comments. I had a dream of being a nurse . When I was little I used to dream about nursing .|0
This one 's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already a classic, and the whole film is chock-full of CGI and special effects  so you really have to go back to the basics before you can really understand what you're watching. But what is it about the bird and the alien that makes you fall in love with it? What does it mean to be so powerful, so terrifying, so mysterious  and, of course, so beautiful? Well, to start, it just means you should probably not sleep in the dark.|0
Leslie Carbaga 's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer 's big move of their new camera from 35mm to 20mm, in which they also moved from black and white to full colour. This move was made for two very simple reasons: first to make more money, second to use the full power of a camera that had only been available for half a century. And it paid off in a way, as you can read about in the book. Now, this was no easy task.|0
Just finished watching 2FTM . The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend. So much of that film's success is due to the fact that it was made with a cast that not only wanted to play, but also were excited about playing them. I'm not sure about the movie itself being as entertaining as the trailer says, but I loved it nevertheless. The movie centers around the lives of five high school seniors as they embark on a year of internships at the world's biggest advertising agency.|0
I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play. As I watch Jacobi, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding Hamlet's character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else.|1
This film is bad . Not so bad it is good . Just bad . It is however hilariously bad. Not in a way to make you think “what’s worse?” or think “how are they doing this” but because it is a complete waste of your money to watch. There is not even an attempt to make this into an action movie. If there had been some attempt it probably would have been better and more entertaining. The only thing you are going to be seeing is “what happened to the people they let off the hook”.|0
The final part of Kieslowski 's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with himself. For this installment, he concentrates on what is probably the most difficult thing he has done, and that is finding the right story for a story based on the French flag. Kieslowski 's trilogy will, of course, be discussed at Cannes, and we can safely predict that it will go on to become one of the most talked about works of the festival. The first thing you may notice about this movie is that it is a French film.|0
I 'll give it a two because it has a lot of music , otherwise it would be a one.I think the game would have been better if they had made it like in the original games. It's not really a challenge at all.But i liked this game, because it made me want to play some more action games again and i got more enjoyment from it.Well, if you like games with lots of songs in them , then this is one of the games that will suit your needs.Well, if you like shooters like the original ones, it is worth checking this out.|0
"I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she ""finds herself""."|1
Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.|1
"Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty! ), beautifully bad dialog (""Do you like... ribs? ""), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! My roommate rented this under the title ""Terrified"" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.Horrible movie."|1
This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny , entertaining , sweet and memorable, this movie would be a wonderful film to watch for people of all age groups as well as children that love a good comedy movie. The main character of the movie is played by Christopher Walken , and he plays it exactly like he should. Walken is a fantastic actor and I am sure there will be many people to thank for watching this movie for their entertainment, it is for this reason why I would strongly suggest this movie for your consideration.|0
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoke the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap.|1
If you love Chan-wook Park , you know what to expect . His films are brutal , poetic , tragic and a feast for fans of Korean Cinema. The latest film from Park is “Chun-ho” (2011) which will be opening in cinemas on Friday, May 22, 2011. “Chun-ho” was Park’s return to Hongdae after several years spent working overseas. Park and his co-director, Kim Jae-yoon, decided to film in Korea , with Park and Kim in charge of shooting the entire film , with the aid of Korean cinematographer and cinematographer Hwang Kyung-hee.|0
It starts quite good , but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are receiving. The first half is just alright . The second half is very good, it’s a lot better than what you have been led to believe. There have been several critics who have commented on the fact that the movie is a sequel. There is no doubt that a movie like this should have a sequel, but it seems like it’s never been done. I just think it’s an interesting approach to a sequel.|0
This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work , whose writing is amazing . Sadly , this movie never really got a chance in theaters, as it never got good reviews. The only reason I can remember why it got a second life in my brain was because it was shown by a PBS affiliate in a class in the high school I went to that year. So, yeah, I watched it , but not until now. The movie has a lot of symbolism in it , and a few of them I already explained, so I'm not going through all of that again.|0
"Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting ""whitey"" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's."|1
I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show 's `` contestants really are, if you ask me, and why it takes so long to see them being treated like such. I even have to watch it twice just to see what the kids are saying about them. While I have a hard time watching it with them in the next room, because it's so boring for me, when they are on the television, I can't help myself from tuning in when they do something really interesting.|0
One of Chaplin 's longest films up to that point , Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex study of sexuality, sexuality and sexuality's role in film making (it's also fun, funny and entertaining in its own right). The title refers to a sex scene, but more importantly, Burlesque is a film that focuses on sexual freedom. From the very outset of the film there is a definite emphasis on sexuality, even though we don't see any of the participants in the scene itself and the film itself is quite explicit in its sexual content.|0
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.After every Lnych movie I tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.So, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it.|1
"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen."|1
I love this show . I watched every episode last year . I bought the DVDs . And I tune into the new episode now. It makes me so happy to see so much love on the new show. I have watched the new episode many times . This is the best show to ever come out . It's so great to watch such a big change from the last episode. I love it and I hope they keep it going.. I am happy for them, but I'm hoping that it won't be this long before they renew it.|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen . this is slow , plot less and the acting and special effects are terrible ! i can't wait to go back and see this movie for the second time . the first time i watched it was because of this and i saw it was a horrible piece of rubbish ! i watched it with my family and they laughed and laughed and laughed every single frame ! i'm just sick to my stomach with this film ! this is bad ! this movie was bad .|0
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics . Sure , it 's fluff , it 's not `` the most important movie of the century "" , but it's a great film . It is not a story , it is not a movie , but the story is the story of a group of high school kids . The kids are in love , but their parents are always away and they feel like they have to wait on their love , which in the end they will not get . And then the movie takes a turn for the worse , and things become more than they should have been ."|0
For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ( `` like , why does he show it all? ``), I have a simple answer: because it is. There are no slow-witted filmmakers in this family; there’s no director who has to rush his work. He’s patient with every minute and tries to create a movie that the audience can appreciate and be proud of. He is the family's patriarch, a loving husband, father, brother and son, and I have no doubt this will be their last movie together.|0
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever . It really does not qualify for movie status as far as any of my friends and I know. It's also a movie about a guy who falls for a female stripper (not the actual girl) and a stripper who falls for a guy, and both of their stories line up with each other. The stripper who fell for the striper, I feel is the best part, but you will not see that in the movie . I'm not saying that it was a bad movie .|0
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. I've seen Used Car Dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids but Wow! The plot line seemed OK but the director should have required more from his actors.|1
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles . when it is said that police work can sometimes be as hard and brutal as it's always been. as the name suggests it is the task of an elite unit of four cops to deal with gangs, violence and drug trafficking. these four detectives were recruited to work for the LAPD in 1950s LA . but in the end all four cops are out of a job for some time. but as one of them points out, they can still work out their differences .|0
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which has n't been given the credit it deserves . the documentary, based on the book 'Lone Survivor' by James O'Bryan, is set against the bleak backdrop of South Korea in the 1980s. the film is made from the viewpoint of the young South Koreans who were conscripted into the South Korean army in the late '80s to fight against the communist North, who were supported by North Korean aid. the film shows how their plight was dealt with. there is much more information and background on this film and more can be found on the web site .|0
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see . It started of as a really decent thriller, but then it veers away from that and becomes rather silly and silly. The movie begins with the main character being kidnapped by aliens and brought to Earth, where he discovers a new planet and the ability to fly to it. The next thing that happens is when his sister dies and he travels to the planet that killed his sister, where he finds two children that have been taken into slavery.|0
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie, looking at after war, psychical problem, from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of Vietnam war, causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father.It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past, with whomEmilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal, and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with.Protective mother looks at this problem with warm , and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.|1
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of Jerry O' Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. Anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie.|1
I'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a $5 bin I figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea.|1
"11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. See this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying ""There's lots of mysteries out there."" followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield."|1
Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, Where's Daniel!? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. He could've helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute!|1
Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction.|1
One of my all-time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film.|1
Bad , bad , movie , so bad it is worth watching . As long as you watch this movie , I'm sure you will be shocked . As you can see this is an American movie but this one is very good as well. The music and sound effects are top notch and the cast is just amazing. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end when this one is just too good to be true . I hope you will agree that this is a must watch movie.|0
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from the start and found it to be of the highest quality and the performances by the actors were top-class. However, the show seems to have become increasingly formulaic as the episodes have been released. But this is only one show so I don't think it's an issue if you watch the whole first season or the rest. The original series was better then this new show with better performances, even though the first series is longer it's very short, and not very good.|0
"While I hold its predecessor , `` Fast Times At Ridgemont High , '' as a standard to which other novels, plays, and movies are compared, I don't agree that this book and the book's predecessor are any better than any other. That's why I wrote a book-length commentary, called "" A Critic's Review : Fast Times At Ridgemont High : The Story Behind The Novel"" , which includes a full-length review and discussion of each novel and movie (with a section on the movie of course) to compare the writing and writing styles and overall artistic merits of each."|0
"can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i do n't want to pay money to someone elses help

This is a great thread! And, I am sorry to burst your bubble, I haven't seen it in a while. But, I think it is great! That is why you are here. And that is why I'm here. But, please, I'd like to know how you are doing. This isn't just your personal life. My mom, my sister, my brother, and I lost our father when we were just 2.5 and 4."|0
Most movies I can sit through easily , even if I do not particularly like the movie . I am not really into action movies ( I just want a good plot , right ?) . Now I really need to get into action movies, I will have to watch them, I have never seen one . I really enjoy movies with plot , well it should have a plot . So if I really do not like the plot I will have to do some sort of action movie I do not know . I will watch a few of them, but I won't watch it all .|0
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically . Anyone who calls this an old film has not seen it. No one is trying to pretend this film is better or anything. It's not. It is just a rehash of the same shit. This film does nothing new that has not been attempted before and a lot of the same old ass movies. The story is just as boring as the story that came out of it the last few years. I have seen all of the sequels with this film. They are the same as this one.|0
Movies are n't always suppose to be about deep , provolking thoughts . Sometimes they 're simply meant to be entertaining . The last time we 've spoken to him was a year ago and now I'm thinking of a film he made that was not about deep philosophy or profound thought . This could be the first time that I 've said this to him . But I suppose it is better to start with something than nothing. I know what you're wondering , right ? Where did we last see him? Well , let me start by giving you the short version of the story .|0
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the `` Haaavaad baaa '' to quote books at each other to impress the readers as they did it. We could not find out if this was the actual translation of the song in the song, or just a parody. I don't get it. I got the gist, but could not see it. ""Haaavaadh baa. "" Aaargh! This was a bad song. Not only did we not understand the meaning of the lyrics, but we did not really like the translation of the lyrics as a whole."|0
Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through.|1
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it . I have no idea how the screenplay for this one turned out and I don't care. It's just so predictable and predictable and predictable. I could care less, and that's how it should be with this franchise. ""You don’t know how hard it is. I am a man who has not seen my own daughter for nine months, and I can tell when a woman is lying, and this woman was lying when she said that she was pregnant. There is no pregnancy."|0
I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie . I wish it were available in my native country ! I haven't seen it in nearly 30 years . I was fascinated to see the film. It was very well made and was a very pleasant trip. I wish I was a passenger on board. The movie made me think that there are people out there in the world that enjoy films . They enjoy seeing movies , and I think it does give a positive message to all those who don't have the opportunity to appreciate films .|0
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. Alas, with TV movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap Cosmo questionnaire films. With a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better.|1
Not a balanced point of view . The director should n't express her opinion as truth . The movie has many scenes of violence , but the director tries to put it in a realistic and balanced way , not just a violence , which is very bad and wrong way . I am very unhappy that you are criticizing the movie . I don't know . I hope that movie doesn't end up like the last , with the director and actor being punished for having a bad film . The movie was very good at the start . It was not bad , and this is my opinion about that .|0
"I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it ! i scored it a 1 in 5, and if that's the standard, i'm going home now ! and if you are thinking of buying it, I would advise you to check out my website ! I'm also available for a sale of any of my stuff, I'd be glad to give it to anyone ! Just a warning to those that think it's ""too good a deal"" for your money - it's not!"|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours , I ca n't seem to forget this haunting film . It is not a bad film . . . not at all . . . a little slow , perhaps . . . but still haunting . . . a bit like the haunting of an abandoned house . . . it is just the way that it seems . . . an abandoned home . . . that you see , when the night falls and you have left your house . . . , and your wife has not returned . . . that it is no longer an abandoned house .|0
Don't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.As I said, the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing.|1
Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but lack Ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. When Mondo Burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like Good Burger is history, until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door.|1
Mean spirited , and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children 's tale not only lacks the charm of the original, it is an outright insult to its fans, as no-one is going to believe that this is actually what they grew up with, and if they were, this would not be an accurate portrayal. In fact when you see these movies, they should be taken at their own face value, but this is one thing that is missing in all of them, in fact they are even worse in the first two.|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori. That might be true but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced.|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store, people around me started laughing, doesn't matter the age or gender. A teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears.. Episodes had a touching and funny ending, specially last one.|1
I loved it . In fact , I watched it over and over and over , and I could watch it all night , and the next day , and the days after that ,and the day after . It was so wonderful , so romantic , that it made me forget everything , everything , and everyone around me , I couldn’t help it , my eyes fell , I fell , I fell , I fell, and I couldn’t stop . . . It was so great . I was in a trance like state .|0
I loved this movie . My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart . There are not too many movies geared at girls , and this film is special for me . This is the best movie in the world I watched it with my daughter . We were laughing our but off with the movie . It's a beautiful film that I recommend to my daughters . Thank you for giving me a movie that made me laugh . It will be hard to watch next year when she is a grown up and has to pay attention in class .|0
"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down."|1
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas but there is no way to avoid it. We all have seen it happen before. I’ve been there myself and even I can relate. When you think of all the toys, the toys at the end of the day, that seem to get put down, you know what you are going to see and it is not so much about the toys. It is not the toys that make a toy a toy. It is about the company and what it can do as a company.|0
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg 's . I had to try it. The movie was a little slow paced but it is really good and there is a great voice for the voice actors too. The song was great too! The song has a cool tempo and it has a great ending! There is also a very good special effects for it. I will definitely buy this song on iTunes! Overall it is worth buying and you can listen to it on the iPod. You can also buy the album for free!|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
"Computer savvy John Light (as John Elias) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon. But, Mr. Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to bed down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a naughty Internet sex session, Ms. Dodds shines Light on. He may lose is ""Digital Dreams"" Internet empire, too!"|1
This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted those hours of my life back . For god 's sake , I'll never make another movie like this again. You can bet your ass that if it happened again , I'd kill it with my bare hands. Not because I was trying to hurt anyone ... but because I was just having so much fun playing with you all. But, I guess I have to say that I'm going to give this one to my brother , he was so sweet . Not to mention he is the only one that saw this .|0
I really couldn't get into this movie. The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. He eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets the blame.|1
Underwoods goofy story about a young man(Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, Arquette is annoying throughout, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable.|1
"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits."|1
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci 's character in this film . If she was supposed to have had a heart, he could not help but have a broken heart . . . not that I have a problem with a broken heart in the first place. What I find so sad and painful about this film is its lack of subtlety. I don't have any complaints about the story as it unfolds, though . . . it's an interesting one, and I do really feel for Ricci in the scenes she is forced to act in.|0
"Dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X.When it appears that a straight laced Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character.Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls? ""Naturally, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore so as to ruin him politically."|1
The subject matter was good, direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major. The acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle.|1
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard about this movie before. Simply, I lost track of Seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. Here, again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. The plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. I simply don't have any idea why Seagal did this movie.|1
An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to blast people to bits, and then using his massive strength to destroy buildings and destroy entire cities. With only a few weeks left before he’s forced to leave the planet, he makes the decision to return to his own planet to continue his attack upon humanity. He also wants his son to succeed in life and take his place within the government so that he can rule over the world from his throne of power.|0
My two daughters ( ages 11 and 13 ) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this film a few days ago. Our girls were the ones who wanted to buy it and couldn’t find it elsewhere. They got the tickets for $9 each and we paid $10 each. On a whim we gave the kids $5 each as a gift, and that was that. The movie is pretty, and I love the story, and how it was made. It’s an entertaining and funny movie (I don’t mind a comedy).|0
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches , each one of them focussing on a female personal device that is in desperate need of a repair, either by itself or with someone. In the beginning of the collection, a character is sitting on her sofa, wearing a night-dress and holding a glass filled with milk. It’s cold, and there is a film of dust on her hands, as well as a trace of saliva on her lips. In the distance, a woman is walking across the street. She wears a night-dress, and she is on the verge of a heart attack.|0
"Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it 's hard to single one out."" ""When you're in a business like this there are so many other things to think about besides talent."" ""There was the music."" ""He was also very famous for his dancing."" ""But that's just one element of a man's career."" ""So you have to start thinking about the people that come behind you."" ""There's the manager."" ""And the band.""

I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone . He 's one of my favorite actors. He's a wonderful guy and a wonderful performer . I feel very safe with him , and when he was in the cast , he was so wonderful , and when he wasn't , it was sad . I've always wanted to work with him again . I always want to see him in something more , like I did with him , I went to see him , and now I'm seeing him .|0
Well I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the cast album and I've listened to it a few times I've never actually seen this show performed and I haven't seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. This version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett.|1
So I caught this one afternoon as `` What Lies Above '' and actually watched it because the beginning was so awesome. But then I saw it again on the big screen (and I've seen it on TV before, too), and I remember I kept wondering, is it worth it to get it on VHS? If so, why didn't we just rent it, or buy it? Anyway, so when I saw the trailer for the movie last night, I immediately checked it out. And it was awesome!|0
"Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie--who woulda thought? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed--""Wisdom"" (with then girlfriend Demi Moore) and ""Men at Work"" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy films---badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on in pure curiousity--it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if it didn't pull me in.It concerns Estevez coming home from Vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there."|1
CAUTION SPOILER : At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days ago. It seems that the bridge was being rebuilt by the same team who took a trip to Mars to make it so they can return to Earth and take some more pictures of the ruins of the city. A couple of weeks after the collapse we find out there is a new president. I’m unsure if this is going to be a new president of the world but I’m guessing so.|0
I must admit I was n't expecting much on this movie . I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as a whole . I was expecting a lot more from a movie this size, but it actually turned out better in my eyes. I don't even really think this is as good of an ending as I thought it would be , but at this rate , I could be the one to convince the producers that this is worth to see a sequel . It's a must see for the horror fans . I will be waiting for it to come to the cinemas and see what everyone thinks of it .|0
And obviously I didn't see it! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.Did Jason Gedrick really decline this?|1
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. It fails at the first post by not being scary OR funny. It is a dull grey movie that I guess went straight to video. Hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school level script. Zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores.|1
"It 's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a huge hit in the past few weeks. I've seen a few episodes of this series, and I like them. It's not very different from ""The Simpsons"" at all. I'm not going to go into the details, but suffice it to say that the characters are hilarious, and the dialog is always amusing, and the humor is on par with the best ""The Simpsons."" It's a nice blend of the real and the cartoon-like, but it's just not like The Simpsons."|0
"This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa . A Canadian systems analyst , Zach Straker ( who was also the first to use the term ""cryptocurrency"" ) is hired to visit a gold prospector in the Namib area where he meets an eccentric scientist who is convinced that gold deposits are being illegally mined by a tribe of war-torn nomadic people . When he meets the man's wife, he is intrigued to hear that she is an African woman from Namibia and the man's daughter is being raised in the area ."|0
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera 's Eve watching an amazing drama. For all the talk in recent times that India has started to make a real attempt at building its own film industry as a result of the ‘Gangplots’ that unfolded against it in the 1980s and 90s — and that this has only now been achieved, it seems India has finally managed to build a good film industry. Not only has this industry grown, but the industry is also being led by the government’s own people.|0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were Greek or Italian so I guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.|1
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.|1
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS , and all my friends and I thought it was amazing , but it took me way more time to watch than to appreciate. It's still an amazing film , but now that I have seen it again I will say the same thing . It is a beautiful movie , but once I got into it, it was just like watching an action movie with no real emotional connection . There is no real emotional connection to the story, and I think that is the point.|0
* * * * Contains Spoilers * * * * As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook , I watched every episode of Supernatural. I really wanted to learn more about Jesse, Dean, and Sam, and I ended up buying the entire series. Now, it seems like Season 4 might have been my most disappointing season. Why? Because there are way too many secrets. One of the first things you need to know about Season 4 is how the season started and why the season ends in such a dramatic manner.|0
"SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yep, that'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of ""Lord of the Rings"", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now, with ""Everything Is Illuminated"" he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character."|1
This movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. I find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.This movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.There is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. There is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten.|1

Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic . Rosemary 's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied in his mother – but he has never been to see her. On the surface, it all seemed like an ordinary family holiday in the countryside. But, as Adrian gets to know and love his mum in the years following her suicide, we begin to see the depth of her problems and the pain that she was forced to endure for decades as a child and teenager. It is only through Adrian's experiences that he can discover his real mother in Rosemary.|0
"""Eaten Alive"" goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" but it's also a far more sillier film. I mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. Tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov)."|1
A snore gore. I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (Now the famous Crobar Night-club)on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three buddies and I laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. The theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. They didn't miss a darn thing. The Worst acting ever.These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema.|1
"This forth film in the ""Angel Guts"" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.Nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. Her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. But when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer."|1
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. On the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.I'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi.I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised.|1
Gracie ( Minnie Driver ) , a woman in her late twenties , is on a waiting list for a transplant . Gracie has been on the waiting list for nearly a year and a half . The doctors have told her that she will be the first woman ever to receive a kidney transplant from a deceased donor . Gracie is very emotional when she hears this news . She tells me she hopes they will find one soon . In an email to me, she describes herself as an introvert, who enjoys spending time reading, writing and cooking. I ask her why she is on the waiting list.|0
It's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches Froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.When it started I already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players.|1
UP AT THE VILLA (2000) **1/2WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's hard to know what is the point in UP AT THE VILLA, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning Oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her.|1
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I did never want to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks.|1
As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome?|1
Yes , it 's a SBIF ( So Bad It 's Funny ) classic . With a budget running into the tens of millions of dollars, no matter what the source , it 's sure to make the cut on any list . the film has all of the trappings of a B-movie . The plot , though , is pure B -movie . It 's a revenge film about a gang of kids stealing money to finance a film . To make the whole thing even more fun , the filmmakers also include an appearance by the film's lead character , who is a character we never saw on screen .|0
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.As a whole I will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialog was even half way decent in Far Cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.Now besides the fact that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role.|1
This film is all right , fairly silly and to be taken lightly . But what I ca n't stand are those scenes where a woman fainted when she saw a man walking down stairs with his hand out . I have to ask , what was he thinking ? She must have been a complete wreck and she must have been afraid he was going to take it out on her. It's just not nice. This should have been avoided . It is just the way I like it . I thought the first half was quite funny . This movie is good .|0
"Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense has n't yet kicked in . We get a pretty sweet teaser of what is to come. This is the second episode to be directed by Chris Tashjian (who has previously directed the pilot and will direct episodes 3 and 4) and this one is a bit more comedic than previous. I'm actually excited to see him take on the lead. In addition to the first twenty minutes, there are some pretty great bits in this episode. Some of the most memorable are:

"Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, ""Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian"" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. Not well done."|1
This is one of the most laughably bad films I've ever seen. I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was connected with making it. It doesn't have anything going for it. There is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project.|1
No redeeming features , this film is rubbish . Its jokes do n't begin to be funny . The humour of the actors , actresses , and directors , makes the film hard to stomach , but this will only worsen . The special effects , the cinematography and special effects do n't deserve the money spent on this film . Not for the squeamish. This film was made in 1998 , it was made in the late 80's , it will probably be released around the same time , the last time this type of crap came out .|0
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school . I thought I’d like it but I didn’t really. But I saw it on the big screen when I was younger and that’s exactly what I wanted.” He laughed again. “My wife and I have watched every installment in the trilogy and I love it. We just finished the last two films. We can’t wait to go and see the new one. But I don’t think it’s a question of ‘when’ we will watch the new trilogy.|0
I watched Love Life on holiday , when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida . It was the first movie I'd seen in which I could identify all the actors and actresses . I can remember thinking I was watching the first film I'd seen where an actor wasn't the lead . I was delighted at the prospect of finally being in the cinema for my own viewing pleasure . I sat and watched , the first film I'd seen in which an audience didn't have the luxury of having their own choice of film .|0
Sure , most of the slasher films of the 1980 's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on , that's why the ones that really did stand a chance , were so bad. This is the third installment of my slashers series, I've been writing them for years , it's like they were my kids , and I just love it. I've seen a lot of good slasher movies since then , and that's what makes me a fan , I think I'll watch every one of them. Here are the slasher films I recommend watching.|0
I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. *spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they aren't scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all.|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr.|1
"""Black Vengeance"" is an alternate title for ""Ying hung ho hon"" AKA ""Tragic Hero"" (1987). I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, ""Gong woo ching"" (""Rich and Famous""), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called ""The Black Six"")."|1
"Well , SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea , and despite the mostly negative responses that it got here in America , the film still got a ton of praise here in Korea. It was pretty popular with the younger generation here as well, even though a lot of people who grew up with SWORD said that it was a terrible film . Here is a link to a video review by a Korean girl who lives in America:

Here is the official Japanese site with English translations: http://movie-japan.org/view_movie.php?title=SWORD."|0
This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun , friendship , and romance, but the story was flawed in that the love stories were weak and not believable. The story was well-told and kept me interested from beginning to end. But it just lacked that spark and I just wasn't into the story all that much. Not to say it wasn't enjoyable to watch at times, though. There was a great amount of humor and action, which kept me coming back for more and more of the same movie, especially in the last half of the movie.|0
This is only the fourth effort I ’ ve watched from this director ( whom I met and found quite charming ) and I was impressed with the style. It felt like a horror film, more than a horror movie . The music added a nice atmosphere to the movie. This is definitely one of my favorites from this year. What did you think? Good or bad? Did you feel like this was a good or bad movie? Let me know! This movie was an interesting and original approach to the genre. You have to love this guy for being so good in this film.|0
I watched this film last night, i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out. The opening scenes were so long winded, the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere. The story line seemed so poor to me, she gave him HIV and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected ( i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people) Then when he dumps the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet, was in the forest and saw him dumping the body.|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best . She 's all wrapped in horror & suspense. She makes her first attempt to kill the wrong guy and ends up making the wrong man her lover. When Traci gets a new job she's not expecting to work with such an amazing man... but she doesn't have much choice. Traci works in a high stakes casino, her boss is a big jerk & she's not getting the money she needs. The only problem is that Traci can't afford a divorce & can't live without her lover.|0
When a loser teen is bitten by an insect , he becomes the superhero Dragonfly ... Superhero Movie is the movie which you will watch when you are hungry. The hero of the story is a hero because they are able to overcome all these problems that the hero has faced before.The movie shows that there are always heroes in the world of the world. The movie also explains the importance of the superhero of the story. The hero's power is based on a superhero of the story. This superhero can be the hero himself or a villain.|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-TV-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session.|1
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. The father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama.|1
"Well,this movie is really ""PLUMPED"" HAHA Get it? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if ""PLUMP"" (haha)! is really unbelievable.The storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. It did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. I mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh."|1
"I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I wondered to myself, ""Why have I never heard of this movie?"" Then I turned over the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters."|1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie . Except for the sister . She reminded me of Janice on Friends . If that’s the kind of thing you want to do in your marriage , you should have her in your life . If she were younger . You would have to ask her if you’d like to get hitched and then you’d go to the wedding and get your wife and her sister to do the same . If she were a younger sister . You could have the two together . If she was a brother . You could have him as a friend .|0
Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was horrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it is a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrible.|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating . If you 're trying to impress some girl, or meet someone new, this could be the movie for you. . You will love this romantic comedy, based on a book that was written by a very famous French writer . The movie features a strong male lead, and you will be in for an action-packed experience . The movie begins with a trip to the dentist . This trip is followed by another to an amusement park, and a trip to a zoo. The movie is all about love and heart-touching .|0
"Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name ""employee of the month"" might ring bells with ""Office Space,"" and the show ""Office Clerk."" I think not. This isn't even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7."|1
I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on `` Mystery Science Theater '' have received very little fan mail. One of the reasons why is because the fan mail section is usually filled to capacity by people who like the films and are interested in knowing what to expect from the next entry. If you are going to review a film for a magazine, do so and let them know what you are looking for in order to determine if the film will be good. As I said, I have received a lot of mail, but it doesn't tell the full story.|0
"`` Son of the Mask '' is a terrible excuse of a movie . I went to see this with a couple of friends a couple of years back . We had a really nice time but there were some moments that did nothing for me . And I just thought it was terrible . When I first saw it I thought . ""Well this is awful"". But then after watching it a few times I realised . ""Well, this is a great movie!"" I mean, this movie was really good, in a bad way ."|0
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. We get a pretty good look at super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end WWII. Except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. Note how it's a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. Once through, it's like any-town-USA, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family TV on the blink. Later on we see little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates.|1
"Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. Sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his card buddies. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family.Faith, family, and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune--""Return to Me."|1
A moderately interesting start , some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan , and a promising idea . But the execution leaves something to be desired. In a series of scenes in which a young girl is forced to stand in front of a mirror, all the while being subjected to cruel, degrading and humiliating treatment, the movie fails to do enough to impress and make us forget the fact that there is no hope of seeing anything like this again in the future . On the other hand, the director has shown a lot of promise in his earlier films and his latest is definitely better than his previous ones.|0
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came.|1
"The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. It is obviously much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. As long as the material's right.The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D"" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage."|1
this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. On the other hand, if you are a die hard Jim Varney/Ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. It does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between.|1
I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed. The special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. A typical unimaginative slasher flick.It's hard to believe, make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots.|1
"There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. How ""Mostly Martha"" was remade is awful. The title of the movie is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of combining good cooking and USA is awful. If you have seen ""Bella Martha"", well that is the original title and it means ""Beautiful Martha"", this one is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms.Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better."|1
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park. It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free.|1
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice , as my original intent was sold on it . I’m sure I’ve seen a bunch of these movies . So, I was really looking forward to seeing it , but the whole thing felt forced. It had a lot going for it , but for the most part it just didn’t work as a movie . It has its moments , but overall I felt like I was watching a movie rather than a TV show . This was the first time I’ve ever seen a movie that was not in the theatre.|0
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence.|1
What an awful movie. Full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. It is hard to believe the same guys that wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of Top 10 Worst Movies of All-Time. Didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Let alone make a sequel for it!!?? Amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released!|1
"As is the case with many films of this ilk , my non Catholicism got in the way of my love. But, after watching this film again, I can honestly say I am more aware than ever of what Christianity has meant to me. Because this film brought it back into my awareness, it helped me gain a fresh perspective on myself and the church. This is a documentary that really needs to be watched over and over. Here is how I responded to the film:

First off I will say that this is a beautiful movie."|0
OK , this does n't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part 's opening sequence ; nor to the almost inaudible opening of the second part. However , it is interesting in its own way , for two reasons. First , that , if the first parts of ' s opening have been compared , they could just as well stand in ' s stead . and second , for the reasons given earlier. For the moment , ' s opening does not differ very much from its first parts , except in detail . but , as will be seen , it is not a good starting point in ' s narrative .|0
"i ca n't even describe it . it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen ( i 'm being brutally honest about it). i 'm soo pissed that i 'm going to hate it because i 'm not sure it' s a good movie or not. however, the actors are not to blame. why are people so blind? this movie is soo bad that they don't even think to take a second look at it
how can people sit there and say, ""this isn't a movie"" and not even see the movie?"|0
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime . Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and regret and are ready to start over again . . . We met Shobana (Babbar) when she was just seventeen years old in her early twenties . Her mother wanted her to marry . . . which was fine with Babbar . . . But once she got pregnant . . . they had an argument. Her parents disowned her and when she was sixteen she had to leave home . . . As fate would have it she came up with a new name .|0
"Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. This film does not. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, ""I don't remember sending for room service"". The main entertainment value is in its badness; I recommended my local video story put it on the ""Turkeys"" shelf."|1
`` Driving Lessons '' sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on , when Grint 's character comes up against his wife 's very jealous husband. What happens if Grint doesn't make it home, or if he finds out something that he doesn't like about his wife ? The solution to both of these dilemmas is found in the film's very believable and sympathetic storyline , which makes for a very watchable and very enjoyable film. The action begins as Grint 's wife is in the middle of an argument with her husband , while Grint 's father is away at work .|0
"I grew up watching the ""Bowery Boys"" on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. Still it was fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs would beat the crap out him. The East Side Kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am repossesin about my childhood."|1
"I worked on this atrocity ten years ago . Luckily for me , no one knows it because I did a lot of work on my own project and kept it private for my friends and family to read. But I'll post it here anyway . There is a very simple reason why people do this. They feel it's a good exercise for them, or to make a name for themselves (I'm sure you already knew about this one, but I'll repeat it):



""I wrote a blog post that nobody would ever read...""



You know what ?"|0
Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public on how to choose films to see. But I don’t do that. I offer what I think is a reasonable analysis on what is and isn’t worth seeing and recommending. I’m sure I’m not the first person on the planet to offer such opinions so I’d like to be clear about that. But I have to do it from the bottom of my heart and not from a financial or political standpoint.|0
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it.|1
I have always liked the Carry On films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. Basically, many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g.|1
`` The Love Letter '' is a somewhat pleasant , very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of music and dance is a minor, secondary part to the drama, rather than the primary, main interest. There's a nice balance between the two, and it isn't too insistent that you get what you want, and if you don’t, it isn't so hard to get out. I also enjoyed the ending, where the two lead characters finally admit they are attracted to each other for real, though neither can say they want to marry each other.|0
This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part).|1
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military.|1
Where do we start with an offering like this ? I nearly said film but that would be going a bit overboard. What I am interested in hearing is how people would respond. As someone who has spent a good number of years thinking about this and is now in the same position as you, I'm sure that you would want to start with your story first. What's the story that you would like to make? If you were going to make a movie, what would it look like? Is that a movie you'd like to see or a documentary?|0
"As cute and adorable as they are , the story of three singing chipmunks just does n't seem to have the right feel , it should really be like the first three movies in the Chipmunk movies series, and in the end there should be a singe chipmunk movie with chipmunks as protagonists, but it seems to be like the third one. The first one is so much more like the second one though and the second one should be more like the first one. I guess that makes it a bit weird to me, as I was expecting it to be much more like ""Chipmunk: Chipmunky Sings""!"|0
"Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in. I have not seen all of his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him best from ""Live and Let Die"" where he played Tee-Hee and which was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona!"|1
I 'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. I enjoy them, and to me, I like them a lot. That's because, as I've often noted, there isn't a single TV show or series that I don't like more than the films. But then there's this. I'm going to go ahead and break it down into two categories. The first is about films that come out that I like, that I have fond memories of.|0
"As was mentioned by others , could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see it? Is there a chance that it was the reason why the film was re-made? __________________

Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious.|1
"I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty ' Arbuckle movie . I really liked him in the movie ""Fatal Encounter"" so I wanted to see this. It was fun, but I am not a fan of ""Arbuckles"", so maybe I am not really interested in a comedy about fat people, but I will still go see this if it is good enough. I did like it a lot in general, I really enjoyed it. ""Arbuckle"" movie was not that good. At the beginning it was very funny but at the end I did not like it."|0

This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. For god's sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. And where do I begin? The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@!|1
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book . So of course , I have some of the first chapters of this novel in my personal bookcase. I can't help but wonder why they were left in there for more than 50 years ! I have to admit , the idea of an assassin, a terrorist , a spy-in-residence and a hero all working for one single organization is a very intriguing concept . In fact , I have been wondering about this very subject for many years . What I had hoped to do was to write an action/thriller like this novel .|0
My wife and I could n't even finish the film . Truly , it was rather painful.First , the historical facts: It's set in a pre-1917 New England town in the 1830s in what is called the Old North State. It's one of the smaller towns in Vermont , and its population in the early part of the nineteenth century numbered about 400 people. This was a time when the United States was at war with Britain, and at the end of the Napoleonic Wars , the Treaty of Amiens came into effect, and France and Britain ceased hostilities.|0
I ca n't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely haven't heard it said by any other fan of my writing. I had never heard of it until just the other day I was checking the reviews on my website and I saw that the author in question is a horror fan and had mentioned the book a couple of times. Well I knew I wanted to talk with the author of the book and talk with you as well. And I'm glad we got that chance. So what are you working on?|0
My grandad gave me this DVD . With friends like these . The front cover looked quite scary thought i had not known about it before . But it was not . This DVD was about a war which was about to start in South Africa . A war which was fought for the freedom of the white race . This war was started to end all wars . One day it was going to end up in North America . But that day never came . I was born in the 80's and i grew up on this DVD . This DVD was made for me .|0
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too.|1
"Where do we start with an offering like this? I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms ""League of Extraordinary Twaddle""."|1
"Does anyone else think that ""Reba"" is basically a ripoff of ""Roseanne""? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who's married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor."|1
I have only praise for this film. From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. This one however changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have actully played Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does he turns to gold.|1
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco's powerful message. The film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people.|1
"Brilliant actors and brilliant picture ! ! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning , it's so cool ! ! I've only watched the first 3 days, I'm not into action movies anymore... I'd really like the 2nd movie of the series ! I wonder if anyone saw the preview for the first movie and was able to tell the difference between the 2 ? Thanks for reading and for giving me your feedback... :)

I'm so happy for you , it's a great show ! My only criticism is the acting is not that great ."|0
I watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of Beth being the younger sister, and making Amy the 3rd one. And Jo interpretation, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying Jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl.|1
"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting."|1
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a film. The acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried.|1
In my opinion , a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and entertaining, and that’s not really what it’s been in this case, at least not since the first hour or so. But then again, I’m not one of the people who watch a documentary like that; it’s rare that they have much to say - and if I’m going to be honest, I’ll be frank; I feel that this kind of stuff should not be made into a film - or anything resembling a film - for that matter.|0
This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. I did not laugh one time during the entire movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in America and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. I cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth caring about.|1
"I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of film-making (shot on DV, to boot) is quite an eye-sore! I liked the script's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer. As to the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the 'star' of those horrid ""Redemption"" intros) has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious."|1
"""First Snow"" has an intriguing beginning. A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. From this point on the movie plays out like a bloated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience."|1
"I'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with ""Go Fever""."|1
"Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever ... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe . The music from award winning composer John Corigliano was the perfect accompaniment to the great film, and I could listen to it all day (and night, even) and forget what happened next. This was an absolute must for any Bogart fan, and you can expect it to be a regular addition to your listening list. In the years before John Wayne starred in ""Bonanza,"" he was still trying to be the perfect actor in the roles that were given to him."|0
As a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge Jane Austen fan , I was delighted to see the return of a show I’d watched many times, and had even grown to love, when Jane Austen was alive, but I hadn’t read a lot of of her books. I was also pleased to see that there was still a strong interest in Jane. Not just for fans of period dramas but for readers also. While there were many shows that focused on a particular Jane Austen character (e.g.|0
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities. It's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.The movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product.|1
This movie has to be the worst film I have seen . There is a reason it was made to be in the cinemas. What the hell is going on with this movie !? I don’t like it. It is boring, unfunny, slow paced and very dull. But it does have some good points. It has great action sequences, an awesome ending, as well as an amazing cast of characters. But the plot of the movie is just too bad . There is nothing funny about the film whatsoever. It is just dull, boring and unfunny.|0
For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.|1
I hope this isn't a portent of things to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst.|1
"Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman (Robert Ames) as the ""front"" even though she is the brains.Of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running everything and teaching him class. She loves the dope, but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos."|1
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan, I have to say that this film while not awful, just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out...If you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the Swedish tundra...I am so disappointed...|1
"Take a bad script , some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you have? An abomination . The first thing I think of when I hear a story about a movie that's so awful I've never heard it before is that the writer/director has completely and utterly wasted their own talent and talent in writing this bad script/poorly acting movie/poor moral tale . So how can this bad script make it to the screen ? The answer is:

The answer is: They don't write bad scripts . I don't mean bad writing per se."|0
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself.|1
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city . A low rent affair with no name. It went from bad to bad in about a year, but never really went anywhere. It was still there in 2009. It's now being rebuilt. In the late '90s, Tedium was at the top of the charts in a country known for its punk rock. It was a hard rock and heavy metal country band. They were called The Doves or Doves or something similar. The Doves were the UK's answer to The Beatles.|0
"For several reasons , this movie is simply awful . Other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical accuracy , but it isn't anywhere near to what is portrayed . This film isn't history , and doesn't represent anything close to what happened . I'll give you a synopsis :

In 1777 , French troops marched out of France with the intention of destroying the American Revolution . The American colonists resisted the French, and fought them in France for five months , but were eventually defeated . On the way out of France , the French troops were followed by American troops , led by Colonel George Washington ."|0
"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann."|1
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple.|1
I , being a fan of Rupert Grint , rented this film a few months ago . I thought it was an entertaining watch , and I was more than a bit shocked when I saw it again today . There are some really good scenes in it , especially the final battle in which a group of elite soldiers, led by one of the most well-known people of all time, is trying to stop a group of crazed civilians , led by one of the craziest characters of all time. The cast of the film are outstanding , and there's an impressive amount of great acting throughout .|0
I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger 's return to action after the dismal movies he 'd made after ``The Silence of the Lambs''' and ``Dark Knight'' had come and gone. And I got my wish: I have to say, I was rather disappointed. What I was looking for when I read the press release for Arnold 's new role was a film that didn 't require him to be a star to sell tickets, but I didn 't expect to get much of a performance from the man I 've been watching on ``The Simpsons'' since 1989.|0
After watching Stop-Loss , I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker . Gone are the days when films such as this one and others would get a big budget and come out with the best films ever . For a movie this good, there are not too many things that you can expect from a movie like this one that is so much better . At first you will see a girl looking in the mirror and say ‘ it’s a girl’ and then she will go and do all the right things and she looks so lovely .|0
"How offensive! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those at NBC saying, ""OK. Let's make a movie to appease those pesky Christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order."" Well, they were wrong. Anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0."|1
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated.|1
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. Besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss Jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday.|1
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like ""Waterworld"" than anything else. I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like ""hoist the mainstay!"""|1
"I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote ""i also expected a Steven movie"", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. In had a little doubts cause i read that ""Ja Rule"" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. And offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. Steven was broke and needed cash?"|1
(Possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away. )I just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic.|1
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios.|1
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.Normally I don't write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer.|1
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie . Of course as I 'm sure you know that there are two sequels coming. I was looking forward to this movie since I haven't seen it for ages. Well I have and I have to admit I just loved it! There were quite a bit of twists and turns in this film as I did not expect it and I'm really glad I went for it since I didn't expect any of the things to actually happen. However I did find that the story line of the movie was quite different from the original novel.|0
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there.|1
This is almost Ed Wood territory . Yeah , that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between Thor and the Mothman. What I don't get is how the car is so slow moving , and that is when you know they are coming. It isn't as though they don't see the approaching monster, that is one thing I have to say , it doesn't feel like they are seeing it. It looks like they have no control over where they are, that's why it is so slow moving.|0
"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an ""intelligent person"" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported ""genius"".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them."|1
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother.|1
"Two years after this short, the last ""Our Gang"" short was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. The quality of ""Our Gang"" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unfunny and Froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of film making."|1
The Toxic Avenger , Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger ( John Altamura who is the leader of a gang of supervillains who work together as a team ) gets his hands on the Hulk, he does not just take him away but actually makes him kill himself, in the scene with his head in the trash, he has his head wrapped up and is put into a body bag , and he is given a helmet to wear and a body suit and he is thrown in the river.|0
"I think `` Rosemary 's Baby '' is the most overrated horror film out there . Not scary , interesting , or that good . Rosemary's Baby was not the best of horror movies , but it is the worst of them . It's the most overrated film in Hollywood history . I do believe that "" Rosemary's Baby'' has become a horror classic . "" Rosemary 's Baby'' is such a great movie that it was made into a musical by the time it was released in 1967 . The score is so bad that it has a cult like status in the horror genre ."|0
There are no saving graces in this dreadful , stagey , boring snooze-fest , which brings to mind `` The Man Who Planted Seeds of Doubt ,'' starring George Clooney . The movie is not a particularly good movie but Clooney does look like he would be better off in `` The Descendants ,'' which is one of two movies he has done that are worth looking at . He is not terrible in those two movies but not great either. This is not a great movie and Clooney should have just done one more film.|0
"I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work.I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that ""Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah."" Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""Oldboy""?"|1
I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. There's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this.|1
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks.|1
Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie It's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful.|1
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they go to a place where there are all kinds of sharks but they have to run out of water because the sharks are too big and it’s too high to climb back up but you’re just supposed to swim around in the sea. and the water in the sea isn’t really blue and the whole thing takes a while. I thought the movie was a lot more like a documentary than a movie.|0
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ! 'Rock Star ' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen . There is no question it was an enjoyable film , although I did find myself wishing that more characters and scenes had been shot . A lot of the action scenes were just plain boring . While it was well acted and quite well written , the film often seemed too long and had too much story and dialogue . Perhaps this was intentional , or perhaps it is simply a case of being an older film . I did enjoy the film , but it should not be seen as the definitive version of its genre.|0
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film.|1
Great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration.|1
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad . This movie is a prime example of present day cinema .The plot goes something like this – a gangster has murdered the mayor. Now the gangster’s gang has a contract to kill the mayor, and they have to kill at least 2 other people first. So they go for it – they kidnap two other people at gunpoint and they do it. Unfortunately for them the mayor, and his henchmen stop the contract. The movie goes on and on . It ends with the gangster being hanged and his head hanging off of a wall.|0
The St. Francisville Experiment claims `` this ai n't no walk in the woods '' , a direct slap in the face of the very people the experiment is supposed to help, the community that has been through the worst economic crisis in its history, the middle class families who now rely on the experiment for their very survival. The experiment has failed to bring back lost jobs to the rural areas where they once were. Instead, this experiment has created new jobs at a higher cost to our tax dollars. It has lowered the wages for the hardworking people who now have a higher need for work.|0
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I only wish Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms...sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. There isn't much interesting going on here but Mr Ford and friends are eye candy.See him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune.|1
"This is an odd movie. On the surface it's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out. Firstly, the main killer character is really weird. How the heck a guy who only ever clucks like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me. What was that female parole board member thinking: ""he's totally reformed and rehabilitated"". He clucks! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script/direction for the women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine I'ld slap her."|1
"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, ""Rainbow Connection,"" Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a ""rich and famous contract"" to entertain."|1
"I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view. I was sorely disappointed. From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it any more obvious? If that is the intended ""twist"" in this film, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem."|1
'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half. 'Thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story.|1
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I have never seen such a cheesy film, but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction, and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins. Goodness they just don't get any better than this. Rush and buy this tape right away.|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays so I know a few things are true. However I have a question. My husband and I bought a new house this spring which we have been working on for quite some time and I have already started painting. He is an artist and is taking it slow because he knows that it may be an investment. As I said this is my first real painting and to me it is one of the most beautiful.|0
"I have never seen this in the theater , my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to the projection screen

Originally posted by TheLoudspeaker
The sound quality is excellent, I've only used it with surround speakers and I love the way the surround sounds. My only issue was that the sound would be a little ""muddy"" on the top end (like I had in the theater), I think it's probably because there are a ton of reflections in my room. However, it did seem to be more ""loud"" than I remember it being on my home theater system with speakers."|0
"A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving a very bad movie on the table. A movie which could have been so good. My favorite line in the whole film. I hate that it's been used in a way that's been used so often over the years in other movies but it was so effective. ""I hate that I am so in love with you that I could forget you are not really there, but I am in a room with a guy and I've never seen anybody look like this""."|0
Why couldn't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him.The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans.|1
"There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the ""most obvious"" woman she's ever met."|1
Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise!!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy.|1
"The back of the DVD for this movie raves, ""Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films."" This isn't so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. Flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility."|1
If you're looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there, don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here.|1
Never, ever, have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. In some ways a little like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time.There are a heap of lead characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as persons show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter.The closest equivalent in a US movie, I can think of, which then is far weaker in every respect, is the Royal Tenenbaums.|1
"But it's not. The plot isn't all that bad, the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent. Instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those ""I can't believe he/she is so dumb"" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character. Also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie. Anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up."|1
There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about `` cold spots '' ( signaling the presence of a `` hot spot ''). But, it seems that there is no such thing in this movie. This is probably because of the limited time period in the movie and the fact that, for example, there are not enough characters that could be called `` people '' in the movie. In other words, you do not really care about what the characters do because they are only people doing things. You do not seem to care what the characters think or say.|0
I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrid and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age I did not laugh once at the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the 'R' movie my parents were in.|1
I'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although because of the poor story flow, I'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. The story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on.|1
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (luscious brunette looker Katja Biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the Mabutos. Director/screenwriter Jess Franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache.|1
Oh what a disappointment this movie is . I ca n't believe it was directed by Wajda . There 's not a single character on screen , that I can identify with. Not even one . What makes this movie even more disappointing , is that it was the first movie he was directed, which means he directed this movie . This is the 3rd movie he directed in that year, all of which are crap . I hate him for that . In any case , this movie was a disaster , and so I was hoping it was the last time I saw him .|0

Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars.|1
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show.|1
This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80 's entertainment . Oh do n't get your hopes up just yet because the movie has to end in something like 2-3 hours so it may not end as well as many other movies I've seen in the theater in recent years . It's been 2 years since the series ended but there is still more to come in the form of the prequel that is going to pick up shortly. The movie is not perfect , it has some rough spots and is a bit predictable , however I thought it was great.|0
"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated ""Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)."""|1
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset.|1
Well well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it by all ways. It's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA. So copies disappeared into the underground scene. All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. So it made this flick unique.|1
...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its a kind of mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! If anyone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.|1
"When a movie's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. ""Soultaker"" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.The plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be."|1
"I just found out before writing this review that ""Komodo vs. Cobra"" and another movie called ""Curse of the Komodo"" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. That might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. They both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. What differences are there?"|1
"""Tragic Hero"" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. Also, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time.One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable."|1
I love this movie . It is the first film Master P have ever done . It is based on the true story of master P . This is a story of a guy who was a legend of the street fight in his time . He fought for justice and integrity against many evil people . And most importantly , he fought against racism and white supremacy. The movie is very real and tells the story of an old man fighting to make his community safe for all . This film is a must watch . The story of the real life Master P is very emotional .|0
"This film is just as bad as ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"". I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast.I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news."|1
This movie was much better than I expected . ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate . I'm pretty sure he was playing the pirate at one point. I really wanted more action in the movie so I don't mind that the pirate character is a bit flat in the last half . It's not a bad movie , but I'm just not a fan of it in the long run. ++++ The action is good for a movie about pirates. The plot is great so I'm glad they decided to go that route .|0
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons.Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson.Acting wise everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller.|1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80 . The jokes in the show are so lame that it is difficult for a person with low intelligence to understand and enjoy them . The show contains many vulgarities and some vulgar jokes that are used for entertainment . This is a good way for you to get through your first month of work . You don`t need to be a perfect comedian to do so . You will need a minimum of 1 year of experience in stand up comedy . The first month will be very easy to get through .|0
This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th Century and early 21st. So when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about telling us that.Also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country.|1
"Two years after this movie was made, ""The Juror"" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See ""The Juror"" instead. ""The Juror"" is essentially the same story as ""Trial By Jury,"" with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her."|1
"Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. At the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers to ""What's this? "", ""What will happen? "", ""What's happening? "", ""What's wrong? "", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.Because everyone's looking at the TV, normally shy students become vocal."|1
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud.One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments ( much less hundreds of 'votes ' ) speaks for itself. I don't see the need to explain why some of them are 'bad', so I will do my best. (Also, it would be a good thing if they could explain what the 'bad' means, as it may be a simple thing, but this is an example of it. ) What I would like to know is, what's it like being a person who has this problem, and what you think it is like to deal with someone who is mentally ill?|0
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung . The acting was over the top , the script was ridiculous , and the casting is even worse , the only reason it made money was for the music . The first half of the film has a lot of things going for it , but when it ends it doesn't feel right . Maybe it's because I am in love with this character , I am so tired of her . I could watch this for the next three hours in a hotel room.|0
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City , contrarian director Mike Judge decided to come to Iowa City for a screening of his new documentary about addiction to the weed. But as the film opens, Iowa City has a lot more to offer besides weed than a bunch of potheads. It's Iowa, a place where the average income is closer to $30,000 than the average income in any city in the country. That makes it a place that's much easier to become addicted to than places like Toronto or Los Angeles, places that are more expensive to live.|0
Yes , why ? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80 's and 90 's Gus Van Sant did one film before he got into directing, I remember being impressed by his style and how he wrote and shot a film. Then he was invited back to write the screenplay of his film and I don't think any of that had anything to do with his directing skills. It's his first film and I would guess he did it as a favor to the people who wanted his film made, it's a good story that has a happy ending so maybe he thought it would be a good investment.|0
I saw this film when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed 2 or three times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous/poorly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed at the performance of Larry Bagby , whom I usually find entertaining. If you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film. Then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts.|1
This is one of those movies that you just do n't want to end . The characters are rich like most good stories are , but it can get a bit tedious at times and the movie doesn't even seem to be interested in any story . It's a great movie if you're looking for something to put on the wall as a reminder of one's life and all the things good and bad we've got to go thru . I highly recommend this movie , but only if you're looking for a little good story to go through .|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century , Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded as a great war leader. Rommel served with distinction in all theaters. He is credited with many victories, some of which were decisive, but was also at times caught in the mire of his own misdeeds. Rommel is best known as a German soldier. Like many German officers of the time, Rommel felt he was an outsider in Germany. Rommel was an avid sports fan, and enjoyed tennis, but he also liked horseback riding, fishing, and hunting.|0
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie . the girls were lame and pathetic , i could feel this in my veins the whole film but that was only a minor annoyance . but it was so refreshing to see such a great film to be honest , i thought i would enjoy it more once i started to see it but there is no way i will ever watch it the same . the reason why i won't watch it is simple , the movie was not good . it was simply boring . what made the story of the film great was the way they shot it .|0
This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. The plot is something that's been done over and over again! However, this one does it the worst! The acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. No one developed any concern for the main character. The movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie.|1
What can I say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, needed the money. What story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. The DVD is out at the moment in the UK.|1
What I hoped for ( or even expected ) was the well known `` stop motion '' imagery and extreme slow speed of the action scenes. So I guess you could say I was looking for it and after watching it I was expecting it, which I guess is all that matters. However, I was still very dissapointed after the first half hour because the film didn't hold my interest for very much longer. I couldn't get into the first act except for some brief moments of dialogue. The third act was more exciting but still not up to par with what I wanted.|0
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.It's a poor mans' CSI. Or actually, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought.|1
'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east, her country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991).|1
OK , so I got ta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for sure . Well what the heck am i gonna say about the movie ? I really didn't know how to review this film when I watched it . It took me a whole half an hour to decide to review the film . After I finished it , i was really impressed . This movie deserves a 7 . I will not be surprised if this movie gets a 10 . The movie was very well produced . Its was very well made .|0
"First - nick-623 , Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941 , not 1942 . They did n't have to predict the U. S. would be attacked and they had to predict that the enemy would be attacked. 2nd - what do you think about that? I really don't get your point. The ""war is over"" is the most important point. What you should know is that there was a war and the Japanese were fighting it. It's the only way they can be defeated. I'm just trying to show you my points."|0
When the movie first started I thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring . After the slow beginning I thought that would make for a great movie , I thought it would be funny . I was so wrong . I thought I would have a lot of fun watching it . I thought the movie would make some kind of sense . I thought the story would have an interesting structure . The first hour was really boring and the story was a bit confusing . It wasn’t fun . I felt like the movie had a lot of cheesy jokes .|0
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out.|1
This movie is really bad . The hero ca n't play . You see too much that he learned his character in a film that was meant to be a joke .The only way to get around this problem is to have two bad movies and then make up the whole thing yourself. This film is not for the weak of heart . Its not funny , so you have to think about the story you are telling . This film is not for adults , kids , or children of any age. It has to appeal to those of you that are older than 3 .|0
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and I've always been a fan of Foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, HATED this movie.Although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in Lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.Although the story chiefly revolves around M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.|1
My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count . This is worth seeing for all you people out there who can’t afford to pay for your cable so they can watch it . There is a reason why it has become a hit on tv. If you haven’t seen this episode , you have been missing the point and this clip will help to explain the episode. I have watched it a thousand times but never knew how it was presented until now. I thought it was just an in-your-face political satire that was funny as hell.|0
Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. When jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her.|1
"As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still going to get ""classic"" x-files, Drive showed that the X-Files was going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive, with the news camera footage. It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events. I would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking, ""Am I on the right channel?"""|1
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen . It looked so amateurish . Chris Hegedus was clearly a nice guy . There were some interesting insights about his work as an actor . I can't help but feel some of them were lost in the editing . Maybe they could have made it better . I enjoyed it for what it was . Maybe if they had hired a proper director . Chris Hegedus should be in the film . A few of the scenes were really interesting . I can't wait until he is featured in a film !|0
...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no thread to follow. I guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky.Not much more to say, really.|1
"Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. You'll enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. I appreciated not having to be concerned about ""questionable elements"" in a children's film for once. That, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film."|1
"For me , reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film -- and of horror cinema , in general . I grew up with horror movies and films which make no sense -- movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and movies like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Saw"" are some of my favorite movies. So when I read a review about a particular movie , I find it interesting and often I get excited about new movies. So when I came across a review about a movie which I thought was great -- but I couldn't put my finger on exactly what made this movie awesome."|0
Who does n't love the muppets ? ! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy. And if you didn't think this show was full of great humor, you would be absolutely right ! I must admit, I had to laugh once during the entire episode ! I think this will be the last muppets season, because I cannot believe that this season was so much more funny ! And I'm not just talking only about the humor part, I want to show you one thing which is funny about this season.|0
and there are not many in cinema history . `` Rouge '' seems to be a bit of a hope of the impossible in terms of genre cinema, the genre films that are so rare these days, but it is one that I would definitely like to see more of. The story, the music, the special effects, the writing, even the acting (though I would not necessarily call it the acting as I believe there is a good number of fine actors in the cast), the story, and the writing - that's what has made it worth making a movie this size.|0
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.|1
Review : Nunsploitation films . They 've been around since forever . A few that pop to mind are the classic “Jailhouse Rock” (1946) and “Carnivale” (1955) . Not much is known of the director/writer’s life other than that he had to be in the Army at some stage and was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia during WWII. This was after the war had ended and his career had begun as a film director. The fact that he died in a plane crash is of no moment . “There was a big film coming up that I’d love to direct.|0
"This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of ""Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" and am now watching ""Enterprise"".I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It is more like an attempt at slapstick.It does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. It does little to build the series.Why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. Was it the writing? Was it the directing?"|1
"This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as The Robe , Quo Vadis, etc., are set in the same period, with a similar religious setting. In general, the ""religiousness"" of the movies of the late 1950s, as with the religious mood of the post World War II period, is a function of historical context, of which religious themes in films are one component, as well as the political context, of which the ""religiousness"" is another component. Thus the religiousness of the movies are also a function of both."|0
If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Do n't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good looking man.I love to have fun when I'm with a guy who makes my heart beat good and my pussy get wet. P.s. I have never had anyone tell me how to make it, so if there was a recipe out there somewhere I'd do it, but if it doesn't make it then it doesn't make it for me. So what the hell do you think, how does it taste? I could eat that shit for breakfast.|0
This movie was sooo bad . It was n't even funny at all . Not even the sarcastic scenes were amusing enough. The actors and actresses , the director and the script were all atrocious . Now I just don't see how anyone could have made a good movie these last few months . What was that director's name and why? The director should be shot . All he needed was to direct the director of this one movie. I would never watch this film again. I had to watch this film at least once . This film should not be available in theaters.|0
Was excited at the opening to hear part of `` Chevaliers De Sangreal '' but wanted more so I bought the complete work of the film and I can't say enough great things about it. It has a very high degree of artistry to it, but is not so violent and it is very well executed. When I was a little kid in the early 1980s my brother and I would go to the local Blockbuster video store which was owned by his parents. We had to walk past the movie theater to get to a door that led to the video section.|0
I am the sort of person who never , ever watches animated movies , but I make an exception for this one because I had never seen it before . It was the first time I have ever heard about a movie called The Princess and the Dragon , so it was an exciting movie to see , especially for someone like me who has never watched films before . The plot was pretty simple . A princess goes to a kingdom where there are two princes . One of the princes is called the Dragon , the other one is the prince .|0
"If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, ""Yep. That's exactly right."" It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice."|1
Have you ever read a book , then seen the movie , and wonder-How did they screw it up so badly ? In the book you see the person is very smart , he or she is well trained and has a good life. In the movie that person looks very smart , very well dressed, very clean and he or she looks the part. That’s how it’s done, but there’s a problem, the person is not real, and you don’t get that sense from the movie.|0
The greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director.|1
"The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief, too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first ""chase"" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well."|1
"It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen , and who will die . It is harder to tell exactly what could happen but I am going to try . . . . . . , and it may be true

I have not been able to write in the past two months because I am afraid of what might occur , I fear that some things might not happen or may occur in a way I would not have expected . One thing I know for sure is ,

that I am not afraid . I am not at all afraid to tell what is happening ."|0
"Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.Basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's ""Real Genius"", with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself."|1
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story.|1
This story starts at the end ! So the film's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950's. The story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.The story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke.|1
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen . If so , than the third part , and so forth. So we can't wait to find out what will happen on June 8th. It seems that the 4th Underworld is going to be an epic battle between 3 of the characters of the first 2. It seems that the 3 of the 4 will compete in it, so that's why a 4th Underworld is coming. But is it going to be an epic battle? Well, I guess it will be because all of the heroes are going to fight each other in the battle.|0
Well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's.|1
Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. The actor i liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.Plot is a little uneven, about Lt.|1
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water.|1
I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance.|1
OK , so this is horror ? I get horror - but I do n't get horrific . Black & white - and I have seen it with my own eyes . What a horror . Oh well - time for a more pleasant time in bed . A good horror film is one that is full of horror . A good horror film is one that has real fear . It's hard to be scary without real fear in it . It is hard to be frightening with no real fear involved in it . There is nothing good in a horror that has no real fear .|0
1931 also presented `` an American tragedy '' , the original tale of `` who will he take up with '' . For the first time , the book has been produced in English. It was published in the spring of 1931 and had sold more than 100,000 copies in Britain . In Germany the book was published with English subtitles, as well as German translation . According to Bülow, the book was written `` to be published as quickly as possible by the Germans . It was not very easy to get hold of German editions of the book and it took almost a year to find a publisher .|0
Death Camp Opera : Right Here , Right Now ! Ten years ago , I read that a very special musical performance had taken place in Moscow at a very special time, in the life of a very special composer, the composer himself was dead. The show was the first performance of the composer’s last and final composition. Now , a few weeks ago, on the same day, a completely different opera took place at the same place and time. An opera that has had no composer at all for ten years.|0
"Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonize Venice. Idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. It is, absolutely, a"" memento mori"". and a exploration of illusion. A old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. ""Death"" is a Orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality."|1
"Wow . The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid . I realize that this movie was supposed to be a part of the prequel but it didn't feel right to me because it wasn't really related to the actual movie . It was more of a parody . The movie didn't try to be a serious film but it was just a stupid joke . The music in this movie was really bad . There was some good stuff in the film . My favorite line from the whole film was ""We're about to witness one of the most epic, epic battle sequences that you have ever seen."""|0
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema . On the left , there are movies made mostly for entertainment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there is cinema made by the filmmakers themselves. That is the case with the latest release of Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln . On the whole, Lincoln looks like a movie made by filmmakers , not by the famous director of “Eagle” and “Raiders”. However, if there is a single movie that has completely defined Steven Spielberg, that movie is probably “Lincoln” .|0
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it wasn't good. Actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to Nora Roberts.I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, Forlani wasn't alone.|1
Art imitates life imitates art . Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A . in this tragic and suspenseful gripping novel of love and intrigue by American author J. D. Robb. After a car accident nearly killed her husband, Detective Atticus Finch is now the chief investigator at the district attorney's office, but the case isn't over with her husband in prison. Now that he has escaped from prison and has moved to New Mexico, Finch has her own agenda. She is looking for a killer, and the only way he will confess is if he is allowed to see the victim alive.|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that , I believe , is not equaled today . The colorful history of WCW , the second longest-running, and most successful wrestling promotion in history, begins here with a match that , in my opinion , has not been properly acknowledged to be a match at all , at least not in the same way that WrestleMania 13 was and that WrestleMania 12 was . The Great Muta (Macho Man) Jr. was in his prime at the time , when WCW had its heyday. He had worked with the likes of Sgt. Slaughter, Sgt.|0
My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit.|1
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director , but he has made some interesting work in that department. His work as a producer on the first season of the FX series, “Argo,” was acclaimed by critics for the way that it utilized the best elements of “hard-core crime” storytelling. For Clark, that meant creating the first three episodes of that first season in just a few days. As a director, his first season directing was a series of short episodes for TV Land. That was followed by a short film for MTV.|0
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a Hill Billy. Her famous New England enunciation slips through, making lines like, ""I'd better rustle up some Vittles"" pretty ludicrous. She's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of American Entertainment well into the 1940's."|1
This movie made me so angry ! ! Here I am thinking that here 's a new horror movie , this is the first time I watched it , but after I saw the movie I think I will watch it again .. I think that you can watch this movie by yourself and I will give you the review of this movie as soon as I watch it . This movie made me angry. I was in the mood to laugh and I watched this movie, I got so excited when we started to see the horror scenes. The movie was interesting , I enjoyed the movie.|0

Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero.|1
This is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had I known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. When finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime.|1
I never comment on a film, but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves.|1
"I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear"" that was shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own ""twist"" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a much better adaptation than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it is a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short."|1
If there 's anything worse than this movie I do n't want to see it . I remember so many of the things I see . And I think that was why the movie was so great . The people in this movie aren't even human . But I wish they were human just to be on the other side . Maybe they would make some of these bad movies . You know . Maybe I should make some of the bad movies . I wonder if I could really make that many bad movies . That I would actually want to do that . I don't really know .|0
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product.|1
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young , not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill , telling her story in what will go down in history as the most romantic book in the world . For years after her husband's tragic death , Henstridge was convinced her world was crumbling , the house was a wreck and the children were dead . But it wasn't until her own death in 2010 that things really started to fall into place. Shelves were pulled from shelves and books on the walls . The children's toys were removed from their beds . When asked whether the children were safe , she said no.|0
Spoiler with plot explanation : a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy in the town, and his family that is trying to get him back, to the country side. One day, the son, a young boy, runs away from his house to play outside of a school to play in. A young boy does not know how to play. So he finds a game, by asking his uncle, who is in the game with him and his sister in the town, and he starts to play.|0
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.Yeah, it is.A patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time period covered was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book.|1
Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By the way, what has become of Ms. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry.This to me was almost like an 1850s version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver takes a position as a governess to a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity.While I realize that this is a period peace, it was awfully dull even for 1850 England and Scotland.The lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers.|1
A real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for TV movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. Stacey Keach is too soppy as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies TV spin off, of Planet Of The Apes.|1
Frank Falenczyk: It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly.Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'You Kill Me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007.|1
Dreadful , stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be working against LPL. I don't see anyone in power who wants this to go down. Why would anyone do this? No one on the government level wants to lose LPL. They have the power to do whatever it takes to keep this in the news media. I can't think of another state that would do this. Maybe they just want the LPL in the spotlight so everyone can see how corrupt it is. That would be a shame.|0
Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting.|1
Ocean 's twelve is probably better than Ocean 's eleven . I know most people would disagree , But I personally feel that Ocean 's twelve is really great . It really has more action in it , more story , more characters , more suspense , and more action . There are just so many ways to get better at playing Ocean , and I think I can find a few more. I will have to write a better story for it , because I think the best way to get better is by writing and reading it . It's really not that difficult of a book to learn to write a good one .|0
"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion."|1
"Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian-built military hospital in the middle of war-torn eastern Ukraine

Sitting behind a desk on a small floor inside the Russian hospital, I listen to the Russian doctors’ and nurses’ banter and banter, and I begin to wonder if this all really is happening, what it’s like to witness a war zone. I ask a nurse if the doctors there are aware of how dangerous this is to them. She laughs. No she doesn’t really know."|0
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I would think you could get that from the title. Also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when. Only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. Good luck finding it at your local store though. I doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution.|1
"Without doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of ""AAA"" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, ""G"" rated family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the ""GRAND CHAMPION"" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, JULIA."|1
Allegedly the `` true story '' of Juana de Castilla , the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (Queen Isabella de Castilla ) and one of her many Spanish lovers , who fled Spain during the 16th century and lived in England where she began her life in 1603 in a convent. Isabella's first marriage was to Charles I. In 1614 she moved to court with her husband and their young family. She had two more children by her first husband : Carlos, who died as an infant, and Juan Carlos .|0
I 'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been said. You are all entitled to your opinions, but we are not all going to agree with each other so I won't get into the argument. I do however find this film a little bit insulting. This is not a documentary in the way that many people on this site would like it to be. There are no interviews with any celebrities, no music clips, not even an interview with director, or with a representative of the film industry.|0
I love Japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to Westerners. They might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others view things Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton!|1
Yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. The acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst i have ever seen. It is a very low budget movie. There is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. Mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol.|1
"Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.Have you ever heard the expression ""as exciting as watching paint dry""? That pretty much sums up Satanik."|1
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that's the way it should be.But on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out.|1
"It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes, trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more, where it failed miserably. Some may like the nontraditional ending, but the attempts at ""deep insight"" into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere.But if you were interested by the story, the movie tried other methods to distract you. The unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was the most obvious, served to do nothing but annoy. The camera-work is erratic at best.One note of caution, however."|1
The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is awful, the female leading actress is chubby, and the story is... wait a minute... There is no story...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to to see Piranhas, you might be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas.The only thing that I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end.|1
"The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not? I am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries, ""Vietnam:The Ten Thousand Day War"", from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. I know America was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war."|1
"There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's ""Robe d'Ete"". It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl."|1
"This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on. But, I'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like ""The West Wing"" or ""Commander-in-Chief."" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in ""Early Edition""). It was a pain to sit through this show."|1
I 'm sorry but I ca n't agree that this was a good movie . Yes , it looked good , it was exciting , but the story , story , story . This was just a very long movie . Not a bad movie , not a bad movie , not a good movie but this is a very long movie . The story is a little bit complicated , and not the kind you can watch it in a couple of sitting . The story was good but it was a very long story. It takes about 30 minutes , and the movie ends in about 1 hour .|0
I have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly). The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember having seen it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been released on DVD or VHS although I shall browse around for a copy.The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young, mute Irish wife.|1
When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV . I just watched the last 5 minutes, and I just couldn’t go on, I was just so happy. After that I wasn’t as excited anymore. I just watched the whole show and I could barely get it together to move. I know that I won’t ever have that ‘feel’ again but I’ve come to accept it now. I’ve accepted that they’ve gone. What I’ll never be is the girl that just sits and watches HAIR all day.|0
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense.|1
"One of my desires is to be a film-maker , and I just have to say there 's no way I am making it with that sort of equipment."" I love it. I really do. And so do the filmmakers who worked on it. It was not a problem. They just sat there for a while and then did what they had to do to do what they wanted. And that was to make a really good film. They just didn't have any more tricks and they didn't have any more gimmicks and stunts that they didn't use."|0
Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who set up the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him.|1
Van Sant copies Hitchcock 's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets : a walkman , and nudity from one of the stars of his films . I'm still amazed . I thought that it was just a joke at the beginning but it was just too perfect. I really hope that he won't leave it as it is. I really hope that he will give it one last chance to do so. This time it is not a joke, it's a real film. I've read in a few places that he is planning on directing it.|0
"Ok , if you like yer monster moovies sullen , stiff , starchy , and thunderously dull , but with an eye for a little color , then yer gonna like this one , and the best part is there is no nudity or blood , you get your ass kicked , and you get to see the aftermath , as well as having sex with yer monster . _________________

This movie was a major bait and switch . I rented it because of Rebecca St. James , a popular author I’d never heard of until her book, How to Write a Novel, came out in 2013. And she wrote it while still working full time as a psychotherapist. And her book was very well received by both critics and readers. In 2014, it was optioned and it was released in September of that year. So I was looking for a movie about her. I didn’t want to go into this without knowing a bit about her.|0
You know , this is one of those `` Emperor 's New Clothes '' films . It 's like , `` A woman in the middle of the desert with no water ? '' That is a good description for this whole story . The movie is based on true events . So let 's start with a very brief background of the film . It was released in the early 2000's in America , it starred the late John Travolta , and it was directed by Christopher Nolan and released in the US on his own Darksiders series . This film has a very good plot .|0
"I've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read "" better than save private ryan""....mmmmm ...i thought cool! guys....is just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun. Nothing to do with a proper war movie. I want my money back! Why the f...k the peoples lies??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light....but they didn't make it. Sorry about this.....but the movie is awful."|1
Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this is n't bad ! In fact it 's quite funny , a real funny Musical with the same cast as a musical . This is the first time I watched a musical that I have not seen in the theater . So I was quite impressed . I will watch it again and again . I think I will watch the next one and also see the film with Julie again . But the next one I have a feeling is not good . I mean I hope they do well in the theatrical . I really do .|0
THE worst movie I 've ever seen , and I 've seen allot . Acting is horrible , plot is terrible , camera angles are terrible , and the worst thing is they didnt give a reason why there is a war at all ! I would rate the film as a 3 . I would rather see it for a short movie rather than a feature because the story is terrible and the acting is not the best . I'm just disgusted with this film . I don 't know if i'm gonna watch it in theatres or on DVD .|0
"Dark and bleak sets , thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife ( or razor ) a perfect soundtrack to an epic battle for the souls of man

I had a great time recording, I’d never recorded so much before and got really into this stuff. I hope you enjoy the music I made for this album and it is available for download, you can buy it from my page. I hope you guys enjoy this album if you’ve never heard it. Thanks for stopping by. Please feel free to message me with any comments or questions you have or suggestions about the album."|0
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it 's best . This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is a must for all comedians and is the type of sketch that will have your audience wanting more. Cynicism, satire, absurdity, and absurdity . These stand-up specials will make you laugh and cry in equal measure. If you're in the mood to go off and find yourself in a funny comedy club or comedy bar then these stand-up specials should be the entertainment you've been waiting for. This is a must for all comedians because this show has an amazing cast of characters and comedy sketches.|0
Although this movie ( and I use the term loosely ) was made in 1997 , we just watched it 3 times in a week in May of 2018. Now that's a long way back for a movie that has been in production since 1987, so that's a long enough time span. There are a few reasons for the delay, the biggest being time, money and lack of knowledge in the industry. The most obvious was the massive amount of time we all put into writing, producing, filming and editing the movie.|0
"If you 've ever been to Ukraine , this movie is absolutely hilarious . From teenagers wearing gold chains , to men in suits , to a young woman , standing up in support of the independence . I have watched it several times already and I'm sure it has made me laugh so much that I can't stop watching it , so thank you for your help :)

I have no idea what all I have here, but it is hilarious and I just started watching it...I just started watching it on Netflix because I'm not sure what else to watch...but it's so funny and entertaining!"|0
The material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.Give this one a miss....even Yancy Butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.I'm amazed people rave about Yancy Butler.....given what I've seen here and in the couple of other things I've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.Last thing is where was this shot?|1
The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only `` star power '' if we can call it that. I mean there is hardly any of it. What do you get when we mix a very young and very thin actress (Bianca Maria) with a very old and a very rich guy (David Bautista) in one movie and then add a whole lot of drugs to the mix? Now I am not going to say that David Bautista doesn't look and act like a guy in the movie but that is not a bad thing for any man.|0
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early '80s Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show.|1
Significant Spoilers! This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.|1
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the ""F"" word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this."|1
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of Director Jack Swanstrom. Clearly, Swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.This thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. As with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie.|1
"It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I have seen the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fits very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character being a gun toting, badge wearing, pair of butt cheeks, shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or ""guilty"". So far, the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, play's the sobering retort to assy's A.A. antics and random ""I've got a hunch"" leads."|1
OK , this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments , but there are a couple of points that were brought up , but not quite addressed, that need to be added here . One is the role of the government, which I didn't get , because I haven't read the source material yet, but they always talk about this government being an evil one, and they are not happy about it . This movie was made in a time period where the government didn't really care about the public , so I guess they could just let this happen and see what happens .|0
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years . The script for James Cameron’s sequel to the original “Alien” was almost never made public, but we now know the film was still in development. This is a sequel that was written and developed by someone else and not in the Cameron mould. The story is told in the first person perspective of David Hicks and his wife Lorna. I think the movie was still in development, so the movie that came out was a continuation of that story.|0
"With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar-race this year. Part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails in delivering the ""message"" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense)."|1
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick , it would be recognized for what it is: an homage to film and a tribute to cinema. That it is a tribute, however, is less a result of coincidence and more a product of the craft and craftspeople that created this masterpiece. As a work of visual arts, no movie can compete with the visual qualities of a moving image, especially on an enormous screen. From the moment you land on this movie, you are in a film. In the sense that this is a film you have seen.|0
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story , I was a little disappointed because the story was not particularly compelling and seemed like the kind of thing where a movie should have done. The film was a bit long, but I enjoyed it as a short horror film and if I’m being honest, I think that it is the best horror film I’ve seen this year at least so far. If you liked the film, I suggest watching the film. The film also includes interviews with key players in the production.|0
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala ""Ocean's 11"", and pin it on the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated."|1
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry ' because this was 'like playing a video game' and that's a fact of life these days in this era. This is a game film that is based on a video game and I can assure you, if you are not already familiar, it is nothing short of awesome. There is no mistaking this film for anything else and I do not think it is a coincidence that this movie has a soundtrack by John Legend and I also can guarantee you that there will be many more movies like this to come in the future.|0
I don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. I'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. Really, actually, I should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. Production is... well, okay. Barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clichés, and an abrupt ending.|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . I would recommend the movie . I liked the movie. I did not enjoy it . I have no idea what the reason was for this movie not being well made or for it not making it to the best seller status on Amazon . But this is still a good movie , I will see it again . I would recommend to everyone to watch . I will go out and buy a copy . It was a good thing I went out and paid for this movie .|0
One of Bolls better attempts . Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just to stay ahead. And i'm sure that if you do things long enough you end up with something good that you had no way of achieving but got lucky and got good results in the process. If anyone has more info on him I'd love to hear it. He was a good pitcher. I'm not sure what your point is. I agree it's not a good move, but I really think you are saying it's a no-brainer.|0
Dire ! Dismal ! Awful ! Laughable ! Disappointing ! Right , your trapped in `` The Cave '' with an extremely poor view in the distance. A few people seem to be enjoying themselves at the table but it doesn't really look like they're enjoying themselves as much as their fellow patrons. I can't see any of them enjoying themselves because they don't have the best view, they do have a very good view but I have to give them that, but the other view isn't that good either.|0
Sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the surface from time-to-time . Her mood changes from being very calm and well adjusted , to out of control , erratic , dangerous . She has always been good with animals and has been known to be very friendly and fun with them ( at least in the house ) . She is a very well educated , cultured lady with a very high profile job , but she has not had any formal training . This has not kept her from being very bright and in a number of fields , very well informed and quite intelligent .|0
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd.|1
There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak.|1
I went to this film having no idea what to expect . I actually took a date to it in my local cinema. From what I was told the film was well written and acted, and the plot was decent. I did not see any of the set up for the character development which I was hoping for, especially as there are only about 10 minutes of it so I just didn’t know how to get into it . I will not say much more on this as I found out that I have to pay full price to see the film.|0
And obviously I did n't see it ! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back and back to normal again I don't know how much more I can take ! Oh no ! But the worst of the worst were the days when I had to sit at a desk and work hard to get things done. I found out that I had cancer and I didn't know for a long time. It was scary but at the same time very exciting ! And I still have a great deal of energy when I'm on my feet.|0
Christopher Nolan 's first directorial effort , a year before he did `` Memento , '' and this is almost certainly his biggest, boldest movie since `` Memento , '' in 1999 . `` Memento'' is, as you may remember, about a young boy who stumbles upon a disfigured body and decides that life is a bit more interesting and less grimy if he has a little of the past left over from his life. Nolan's film is about a lot of things, most of which would seem to be a lot more obvious than most movies, but none are as important as what it's about.|0
It looked cool from the movie sleeve , but after five minutes we were n't sure if it was a cool idea . . . we watched it with a smile on our face and were amazed at the idea of a movie with the main characters from a series that wasn't based in reality and was in a fictional world with real actors . . . then it occurred to me what this would be like , as the main characters and crew had real lives . . . and now I had to wait and watch this until I saw it with my family and friends .|0
When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb , FBI agent Dick Martin and his sidekick, Dr. Donna Troy, are drawn into the story. When Dr. Troy is shot, she asks Dick if she can be of help. The man who has been killing these people must be stopped as soon as possible. But who is this mysterious stranger in the shadows? The man, who is now in her body, asks her to stay with them until his return. What will it take for him to leave them alone again?|0
I could n't stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime . Comparisons to Hitchcock are inevitable , but the story and characters are much different . So is the ending . It's an excellent suspense thriller . However , I felt like this was a pretty slow film , in terms of pace . A couple of the story lines were slow . Some of the plot twists weren't that surprising , and the climax felt like a stretch . I was surprised and disappointed with the ending , but I would definitely recommend this to anyone . The only problem with the film was the soundtrack .|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (I'm hesitant to call ""Cimarron"" a ""film"", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it...mainly speaks against it.Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character--an overbearing and over-ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office."|1
This woman is a terrible comedian . She ca n't crack a joke . She has no real character . She makes jokes about people that don t like her . And she s not even funny . There s no spark in her , theres not a joke to be found , and you wonder why she makes it ? I m sorry , that was not good for the evening . I d rather she made a joke , just like all the other women who just like to make jokes . She s got no character , she just wants to get attention from others .|0
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it 's Seattle Film Fest screening , and was blown away by how different the film looked , the cinematography & editing were just spectacular, and the acting was so amazing. It was a must-see for me, and for anyone who loves great visual storytelling, this film will knock your socks right off!! If you're curious about what kind of story the film tries to tell, there is an article here that talks about it, and also gives some insight into some of the details.|0
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett (A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper... and it delivers just what I'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected it to deliver... and a bit more: Brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale.|1
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover of this DVD make a direct reference to its theme. I had to dig a little deeper into the story, to figure out what the real story was, before I found the answer . . . I don’t understand this film, which is a romantic suspense, set in a small town. I can see how that might be difficult for some to follow. But it makes sense once you understand who is involved with this tale and why.|0
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not Europeanbut a sleaze Americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. This installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.Now what I find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.These sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre.|1
Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age.|1
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life.|1
This film was great ! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job . They both look good together and have a really great chemistry . I really like their looks together , they are both good actors and this is really a fun movie . This is not a romance , this is real . I liked how they show the real story from the end , the romance is just a plot device that happens just to give the movie a nice ending . I think the movie is pretty good , but the romance does make it interesting and I love the ending .|0
You know you 're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you . I 'm okay with it, but it's not as great as it could be. There are moments when you can be a real man, but then the scene changes to something else. If you 're having a hard time figuring out what it was, I suggest you take a few deep breaths, and just let yourself relax . I guarantee you'll come out the next day with a better sense of how you 're enjoying the scene. That's just what I do , I tell you!|0
Having been raised in Canada , I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC . I have seen it on TV (and read about it on other websites) but the movie made it to theaters in Canada. I read a lot of reviews and it is a great film, with a good story and the characters are real. Now that it is getting it’s time, it will probably not get as much of a release there as it would with the US but I hope that I’m wrong and there will be another film made about this story that is even better.|0
Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping . Were they run into the same kind of situation and were they able to help each other get through it? Who are you rooting for? It’s a pretty interesting situation. I actually didn’t think about this before, but the thing is that it’s an age-graded camp, the Cub Scouts have to be in their 20s. Some of the older Cub Scouts are on their last legs. They’re probably going to the last camp and say, “Hey, this is really hard.|0
One of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that we tend to forget the most important thing from the era: women. And I think that is the most important thing. We need to forget about women because they were not nearly as influential in that period as most of us realize, which is that they weren’t “the cool girls”. They didn’t have the hair, the fashion, the celebrity status, the attention. They were just normal, ordinary, everyday women.|0
Reba sucks . It sucks hard . It 's about this awful country singer attempting comedy . They might as well have called him the King of R&B . I guess he 's just not trying . It sucks hard . The song is catchy . No one will be surprised that the song is awful . It's about this awful country singer that 's trying to make it in the industry . And I'm not a big fan of it . Maybe it 's just the way I am . Maybe that 's it . But the people aren't surprised . The song is catchy .|0
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor 's planning to hijack a casino , ala `` Ocean 's 11 ."" Their plan is to steal the slots . But the only slot that's really for sale is . They say the $10,000 slots are so scarce that no one will play 'em . Their plan is to buy 'em and pay off with $5,000 to play them . I think it will be a lot of fun for the guys and gals. For $5,000 you get to do whatever you want to do to that slot machine ."|0
`` Hoppity Goes to Town '' was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave, and is the only surviving original Max and David series animated feature film. It also has the distinction of making the series popular enough to make it into a TV series, starting with a short run as a weekly syndicated series in the early 1960s. In the TV series, this story is set in the 1970s. There is a lot more to this story than I was able to properly explain, but hopefully this will give the general public the general idea of the story.|0
I just caught this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww , not even fun in a bad movie kind of way . It is a documentary about a band that goes to a strip club to show off their new album ... the strip club owner is disgusted ... then they go out on their first date together and he tells them their new album is not the same as the first one ... which makes me think ... it must be the first record that has a few things wrong with it because it was released two months after the first album so it would be totally obvious ... but no ...|0
[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it.|1
First of all , let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I 'd been sold a bunch of BS in order to get my money, I don't expect a review to last more than 20 minutes. The first thing that came to my mind upon reading the review of this movie was all the complaints I've heard about the movie, I thought that maybe the main problem was the story itself, not just the quality of the writing. As I watched the film, my mind wandered over to what I felt was a few minor flaws in the plot of the movie.|0
If you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll want to find an online alternative. If you 're tired of the same boring and predictable plots , you'll want to check out The Art of Animation, a web series created by acclaimed animator and filmmaker Richard Williams. Here's a glimpse at all of Williams ' videos , and if you can't find anything there , you're in luck because this one is on DVD . The Art of Animation tells the stories of six talented, hardworking, and imaginative young artists working in a variety of mediums.|0
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen . The story line is a joke , the effects are terrible . This is a comedy . I have never seen or read this movie but I was told it was good because it was based on the book of the same name by Stephen King

The movie was written by Jack Kesy. The story is based on a true story. It was the story that inspired Stephen King. There is also a documentary that is about the book, but I haven't seen it

The movie was filmed by John Hillcoat and directed by Robert Benton."|0
"Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the ""magic"" transcends all that other stuff."|1
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut's between important parts. And leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all.|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films -- yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions as he sees himself at his most vulnerable. The actor is in the best possible shape when he returns to acting in his 30th year of acting. That he is in the strongest possible shape is in part due to years of exercise, and part due to age -- he is at age 77. He is also at his most powerful physically and emotionally in his performance, in part thanks to his love for and appreciation of his wife Rosalind Russell.|0
"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film ""Howl's Moving Castle"". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold."|1
"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic! ), than the man alone...) and to link the ""adventures"" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying ""Oh, a boat!"") were awful."|1
"Earth Final Conflict began like a new world , a new vision from the creator of Star trek , something so different than all the old stories , the new world , the old world a place of hope where there is a new hope and hope is the way

The world that we know and love are just a dream . the world is just a dream we are dreaming for the future of the whole planet . there is no such thing . there is no such things as evil . all evil things have a past and a future ."|0
I loved so much last Bellocchio 's movie , the masterpiece `` L'Ora di Religione '' . It had a great impact on a good part of world . This film , in particular , will be remembered , as well , for its extraordinary story . So , I do not know how to describe it . At the end , I think , we can say that it will remain one of the most beautiful films , in fact , that I have ever watched . After all , the story is one of a young woman , born without a uterus , who is forced to have an ectopic pregnancy .|0
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, I still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans,and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Medieval times. Lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion.|1
"Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Shall I go on? There is one, I repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing Amateur Hour Special of a film: Fares Fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking Swedish ""actors"" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning."|1
"`` No one really knows how the Power came to be . Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its descent into the realm of demons . But that doesn't matter, as the truth is in this, that the Power was once pure and holy and the very foundation on which it rests . ""I'm going to leave you now with these words. They're meant to give you a taste of the power, and an inkling as to how much is there . The Power of the Book of Power resides in the mind of the Power."|0
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively . Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi. But I’m not a Buddhist, and that’s why, I have to ask this question, is it worth it? If you’re not one, you should go ahead and go back and see what happened. You may not understand. Do you have a reason why you’re angry, because this is for you to judge, is it your will or your desire? You can do anything you want or desire.|0
When I was driving home after work , I bought some movies for my four year old twins . I was very impressed that this movie was rated G . My friend told me that this was a movie I have never seen and that I should not see it because it is too scary. Well, here is why . It is not my friend but a good friend of mine . I do not think this movie is scary at all . In fact , I thought this movie was great . This movie was so much fun that my friend and I both cried .|0
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was . Once in a while you see an organization that makes me question just how blessed I am to even be a part of it . . . and to have the opportunity to work with these amazing people is an unbelievable blessing . I am not quite sure just how I would ever describe this company . It feels like a family . I love these people . They are my family . . . I love the job I have and would do it again . . . I feel that I am blessed.|0
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie . If at one point i had known what was in store, i would never have recommended it to you. But there is a lesson to learn here. I am sure many will disagree with this, but I promise you, that this is true. I am also going to tell you that i do not recommend reading or watching this because you are going to be disappointed in it, but I will explain why i think this is a bad idea.|0
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford’s name. ROCK STAR is the true story of Ripper, a British bandit who’d robbed hundreds of people across London’s East End between 1879 and 1885. As he tried to escape with the loot, he was pursued by the police, including a posse led by Halford. The story has been retold in a dozen films and countless books. Here’s how it became a hit in the 1960s:

ROCK STAR was first released in 1962."|0
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing ( especially when they were talking to the man ) i thought the entire time it was like a zombie movie , like it was real and not fiction . and then theres the scene where they all went to the store and they ran into that old man in the back of the store where all of them had to run through and then they ran back into the man who killed all of them i thought was so crazy i had to watch it over and over .|0
River 's Edge is an excellent film and it 's a shame that it has n't made more of a splash. It had promise but it never managed to catch fire. There are no real flaws, just a few good scenes and some nice moments of genuine horror. The main reason this film is so underrated though is because there was so little to say and so many things that we can do with the time we are given. As you would expect the film starts with two kids on a road trip and a car breaks down.|0
Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now!Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was acted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually.Over the years, I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would, by coincidence? Anyway, it's yet an old story. I saw it a short while ago.|1
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies . My only quibble is that the director , Peter Yates, is not particularly good. It’s a movie that’s well acted , and he makes a lot of sense in his dialogue. The story itself, though well-conceived and executed, was a bit of a bore. I’d have loved to see him stick with the movie and try to make something interesting out of it , but the movie just doesn’t work. So I saw it again, only this time I didn’t enjoy it as much .|0
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me . I made an account on IMDb just a couple of hours ago. So I am sure this will be my last watch on this series. It was a very good series and one that I will always keep coming back too. But, I could not be mad at all at this . I am sad to see this go. I have seen so many great series this past year but I am very glad that this will not last longer than 2 seasons. Thank you for this show.|0
This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and her children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.This movie is based on a true story--like Jesse James was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader.|1
A group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. They each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself.This not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie.|1
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness, ""Half Empty"" is a must-see. This original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make ""The Producers"" seem boringly staid. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. When his book on happiness, ""North Star"" finds zero success in the States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour."|1
"The ""silver screen"" gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy, humor and lust for life. The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to ""live each day as if it's your last"" and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!"|1
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story.|1
"Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart does n't appear to be in it . . . at least not the way he's been telling it for over a century. . . . ""I was a fool to think I could win a case in the United States . . . I knew that I could not win it . . . not even with all my efforts could I win it."" . . . Alfred Hitchcock, in a speech in Washington in 1963 to mark the 25th anniversary of his trial. But that's the thing."|0
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever.|1
I saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as I hit the street, like ... you see, I can't even think of one!|1
"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster."|1
"What has Rajiv Rai done to himself ? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now at loggerheads with Rajnikanth over the direction of his upcoming film. Rajiv has given a letter to Rajnikanth in which he has challenged him to direct a movie in Hindi or not to work for him at all. Rajiv was quoted saying,

If I can't tell you whether I want to work in Hindi, I am not going to work at all. I will let you have the final word of that. I will be writing a letter in your name asking you whether you want to do an English film."|0
"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris , more shallow than the Big Book of Jell-O salad, you needn't look further than its latest incarnation. For the first half of the current episode of ""The Venture Bros."" (and the first episode of ""The Venture Bros. Original Family Series,"" which I'm pretty sure is the best in the bunch by a large stretch) I'm referring to one of the most ridiculous, unearned character arcs of the show's young life."|0
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'.|1
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it's all over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. There is enough of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.|1
"Chupacabra : Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made . I had to give it at least one star, I could not give this thing a higher. It just does not deserve the title it holds. There are so many ways in which Chupacabra can fail. The first and most obvious flaw, is the use of the term ""chupacabra."" It makes no sense, or at least any sense that I'm familiar with. It makes even less sense when you see how the term is defined."|0
In Everything Is Illuminated , Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer , a Jewish American who is looking for the woman he loved years ago. A woman who can’t remember his name, but doesn’t have to. A woman who is looking to reconnect with a man who can. Foer, who has a troubled past, takes a job as a clerk at an antique store, hoping to reconnect with the love of his life, his mother. Foer falls in love again, only to lose his job, his new love, and his mom.|0
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels.|1
This movie is amazing . You will NEVER laugh harder . It 's a target . No , I think that the target is all of us , because it 's about how far we are from God and from each other , and if you are not careful , it will be like that . In the movie we learn that there is only One , but we are told to love and accept and respect our fellow man . If there is another man in our life that we want to kill , it is our job to do it .|0
If extreme activities (and I don't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts's obsession to prove himself against great odds. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.The filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him.|1
"I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, ""Destined to be the next stoner classic"", hardly.Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on."|1
"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.The fights are not of high standards. They are way too ""simple"" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success."|1
I have seen this movie three times . Going back to VCR 's , in the 1980 's , and the first time we went to the theater. I thought it was one of the worst movies ever made. I still have nightmares from it. I guess this is not too long after the fact. The movie is supposed to be a sequel , but the writers have decided to kill the main characters . They don't really give a fuck about them . It's not even clear what part they're playing . All we have is two actors in the roles, and no director.|0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkinscreates a film like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. After they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in PunishmentPark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). I can't say enough about this movie.|1
"What to say about ""Dead End Road""...Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, writing, effects, and everything in this movie was just horrendous. That doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had to sit through. That is also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally I didn't care what happened to the characters. I have seen bad but this was definitely the worst. I got hyped up for this because I am a fan of Poe and this was just bad."|1
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot.|1
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. This one though, is missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.Im in agreement with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. In this one, he is heading the emergency office. Being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. Clever thinking.|1
Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that David was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts.|1
I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera . I think it 's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movies . In my case I am not fond of the camera . It has a strange way of focusing . Sometimes when I try to move the camera lens , I am not able to move the camera at all , or I am able to move a little bit but it is useless . I did not have this problem while shooting . Then I was curious if you can help me , it 's really annoying . The camera seems to be too heavy and it does not work well .|0
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.|1
This is the first porn I 've ever tried to review . It demands a different approach than usual , and I think that's a good thing . There are several good things with it , that make it worthwhile , but I won't spoil it for everyone . The first thing that I noticed , is that it's a bit dark . I normally like a bit of contrast and contrast and contrast . So I guess that the contrast is what made me decide not to like the film . There is some very strong contrast between the two types of porn , and that contrast is what makes for a different experience .|0
Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless.|1
Okay they tell you it's real. They don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - It's not real in the way you were hoping for. The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). Therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage.|1
This film reeks of production line planning . It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and decided that the formula they had established for those movies was still applicable for this project . If I were to guess , the filmmakers have decided that the way to market this movie is by trying to appeal to every possible demographic with this film . The fact that this film is a big budget production , with huge budgets in the film , and this is a movie about the Vietnam War ? Well, that's an easy sell .|0
I know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; I was , at first , a little sceptical about the claims of these books , but , after looking through them ,I have become much more impressed , with what I have read . I think that this is what the science of this age is about , it is the advancement of science . These books should be read ,and studied for years before they are believed , rather than just thought . It is strange , but , there is no such thing as a scientific truth. The truth is simply what works and what is true.|0
Mikio Naruse 's examination of the lives of three idling , constantly complaining , single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a fascinating look at the lives of individuals and their families. Naruse's book has a lot of potential for teaching us about Japanese history. The life of Mikio Naruse has a lot to teach us. He is a graduate from Tokyo University and a post-graduate from Oxford University in history. Naruse's books are based on research in Tokyo, Japan and in England. Naruse has lived in a number of Japanese cities. His books are also written in English and are available in Japan and in English.|0
First of all I hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their forehead.I would rather listen to a decent rapper than any of the stupid ones, but this is something that should never have to happen.I dont care if you are black , white , latin or jewish . You are still a man and you should always treat women as your equal .If you do then thats all that matters. I hope you get the message and realise that you have your place and you dont need to put a gun to a woman's head.|0
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I've liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies but I'm afraid that having the other characters call him Chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris.I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film.|1
"This show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the contestants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was ""Survivor"" or something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together."|1
"If you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. It did for me, at least. I'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the ""underwater shots"" of the ""fish"" ""swimming"". The sound which accompanies those shots is great too.One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as ""The Greatest American Hero"" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since."|1
Going into the movie with the right expectations , I somewhat liked this movie . Like most reviewers who have been around for quite some time , I enjoyed the movie . I felt the story was strong , but it did not make me think it would be an interesting movie . The movie was not exciting , and the ending was not one that made you feel like you were watching something special . There is something about this film that I liked , I felt the story was interesting , and the characters are well done .|0
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted.|1
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait , but ended up getting so many tickets for both concerts that I could have easily taken them home and done with it. I have a couple of DVDs of both concerts I would like to watch but don’t really like to waste my time on them. I also have a DVD of “One Night in Paradise” that I watched with a few people a few years back, which was a bit too long at only about an hour and a half.|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at a different stage of life.The movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you have seem them before. Yet I would not want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note.|1
"After five years in prison , Tony le Stéphanois ( Jean Servais ) meets his dearest friends Jo ( Carl Dixen ) and Jean ( Roger Allambert-Lambert ), and decides to leave prison. The film ends with a scene showing Jean's departure from the house in the film with his friends and the departure of Jo and others from the jail. The house is empty, Jo and Jean left behind in prison. Plot
At the beginning of the film, Jo (Cherie) and Tony (Jean Servais) are locked up in prison, and have no friends or relations."|0
( Possible ? ? spoilers included , but nothing critical given away . ) I just watched this classic low grade B movie which was made back in the 90's but you could still see where it was coming from. If I'm not honest I just want to write a review on it, so if you're willing I would like to share this review. It is so bad it is funny and very good. This is a classic. This is probably the only good movie this decade, if you want to watch this film you have to wait a few more years to see it.|0
I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.Not only did Master P start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him.|1
This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audience. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average.Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. All through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding.|1
"I am a firm believer that a film , TV serial or any form of art should and would be produced in a time and manner which reflects the times . It should be so, so good that it is worthy of being preserved forever as a treasure to the world . Friday, October 25, 2012

I know you are wondering why you are here. You are looking to know what kind of film/TV serial you should watch at the right time of the year . This is what I am going to tell you about the right time and the right way to watch films/TV serial or any other form of art."|0
"In the twilight years of his career , Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors , most notably J. Lee Thompson and Charles Vidor

“Charles Bronson and I had a very good time together. The first time was when I directed him as a supporting character,” said Thompson, who first met him in 1938. “He was very funny and a brilliant writer, and I found myself in a position where I could be creative for him on screen.”

“I first met him a few years ago. I had an idea to do something with him in ’42 and was trying to do something."|0
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout."|1
As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was Bad Acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse.|1

When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year.|1
A vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.|1
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is, then this would be it. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but rather this year alone, I haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far, be it from the West, or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great premise, but poor execution, relying on clichéd techniques (I think these are the only tools of the trade available?)|1
I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features, and classics, you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son), and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it.|1
Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots , yes Camp Blood ( or if you are from North Texas you just know about it, and if you don't it's still pretty good) , is the best place in Texas for a picnic and get away from the noise, the crowds , the people and the pollution. I'm not kidding, just a little tip of the iceberg for me. I've been camping in Texas since 2001 and have done it a few different times. You won't believe the noise and the pollution!|0
Another sequel ! Why on earth do they keep making these ? This has got to be the weakest 'franchisee' movie I've seen in my lifetime and I saw it 2 years ago so maybe I have a bit of bias but it was a bit crap to be honest. 1. It's obvious from the trailers this was going to be crap and the only way to get past it was to watch the trailer for the second one. 2. The characters are not developed enough and it seems to be a waste of time to go through the character list for this one.|0
I viewed my videotape last night , for the first time in at least ten years . I found the story a little more disturbing , but also a bit more humorous at the same time . It is also very well written , with excellent character development . I think this story is worth a read if you want to hear more about the life of a serial killer and how he has been treated in court by both the media and law enforcement . A little bit of backstory can add a lot to the overall story if you take the time to understand how the victim of this heinous crime was created .|0
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess.|1
"( This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie , however it may change one 's expectations )

Somewhere during the late 90's there was a well known band. They used to get together for one or two gigs and then split up. Well, that was until they came out with their first full length album and started making music. This was a period where a lot of bands were starting up. One thing that I love about them is that they wrote their own songs and were writing for themselves as well as other bands."|0
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan. I figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15 minute mark , I was begiing the others to let me rip the DVD out and fling it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore it had to get better.They were wrong! This movie was lacking everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it.|1
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending. Heartwarming performances, action, humor, and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget.|1
This is a classic continuation to Bleu , the likewise excellent film , with Juliet Binouche as a main star. I can’t quite remember when this one was released but it was probably about 4 years ago I believe. I found the movie quite enjoyable but didn’t think much of the plot. In fact, I found it rather odd at first. I was very disappointed when I started watching and realised it was only a prequel story. The story was good and all the characters were quite interesting. I did have some issues with the movie though.|0
"I just watched this , an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his `` glasses '' character on Kino-Eye. This film was released in 1931. Here is a clip of the film. I watched it and was impressed. Here are a few of my own thoughts about the brief but interesting scene:

1) The glasses are clearly the most important of the three characters and the most important to this film. 2) Lloyd had a definite sense of humor and made a few gags with the character. The scene is brief and interesting enough."|0

My Mother Frank begins as a warm , amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman ( Frank , short for Franciscan Mary ) who decides to take her troubled son out into the world to try out his faith. When she learns that he has never gone to confession, Frank begins to see that there has been something wrong all along. But it turns out that she has never asked for forgiveness from her son, or indeed for anything, and she will be forced to give herself completely to Christ if she will accept him into her family and into her life.|0
Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.|1
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age . Clayburgh goes to take pictures of himself and his mom and dad on vacation and gets to know his dad. Clayburgh is in his 20's and his mom is in her 40's and he thinks he has a future in music. He also thinks that he's a lot smarter then his dad. He's a very nice kid, but he also has his own little issues that come to the surface. His mom gets very depressed and he is a little too sensitive sometimes.|0
First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie. 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven.|1
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.|1
"Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot ""Thirst"" - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong."|1
The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. He does -- I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments I found amusing -- Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions laid on productions by the Hays Code.|1
Until I did a Web search on `` What Alice Found '' , I did n't realize that the name is the one on the title page. This means that the book was published more than a year before the actual title was published. There are also a few footnotes and other material not included on the title page. I've included the actual book page and the page number for the title page on the back matter. Thanks for pointing this out! My question is: is it possible for me to have a link on the front of the book for the author?|0
In yet another case of misleading marketing , this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called `` Women in World History '' . The title is misleading because this DVD set includes several of the best films on women's history . What is interesting is the fact that the other 9 films on this set are all films by male directors . When you compare these 10 films it is easy to see why female directors are not in the running when it comes to film awards . In fact it seems to be the opposite when you consider the movies in the `` best films on women's history '' DVD collection .|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . The story was kind of weak . The acting was good although I felt like there was too much dialogues . I thought the music was cool but it wasn’t very well done . And the animation is really bad . The characters don’t look real . The story and characters of this movie look really old . I would like to see a story where there’s no story at all . The story and characters were pretty good but the acting wasn’t that good .|0
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. And trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.|1
Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation Robicheaux is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers? ?, What a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected. it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time. Another FLOP, i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1:42m of wast-full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence.|1
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies.|1
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her great fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection.|1
"I have never seen this in the theater, my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.Hitch's pallet here is the ""game play"" between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice?"|1
A vg Brit rom-com , one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy . Quirky and quirky are the keys words here , and a couple of things you won't see in the trailer . First off , for some reason the trailer is in 3D . Second , I don’t see any woman on the screen , they’re all white and bald , it looks like they are all wearing a white dress , like the people on the cover . Third , the plot is about a girl trying to find her way in the world .|0
"""The Man From Utah"" opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. This is how we're introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), heading into town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also happens to head up the rodeo committee."|1
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique , brilliant , and very twisted at a minimum . Well , I will be the first to admit, I am a sucker for Park Chan-wook and his films . His films have always had a special and special charm for me . While the films themselves have been very good in their own right . I can’t wait to watch his newest one . What I really love about this movie is that Park Chan-wook has never been one to follow the rules of the traditional box office . So , he has created an interesting concept in his latest movie .|0
"We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back . Knowing it was an old-school film and a bit rough around the edges (as I'm sure you've noticed) , I wanted to try my hand at making my own. It didn't work, but it was worth it. It's a little more ""old school"" on the outside (as I said, I don't mind it), but inside it looks fresh and the production is top-notch. (I'm not complaining. I love the story and the characters in this."|0
"SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with ""Oldboy"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, ""sang"" means ""blood"" in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim."|1
I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was.|1
This movie was so frustrating . Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time . But then I felt it was getting way too long. I am not talking about the whole movie here but I felt like there is no real ending and that it is just a filler to get us through the movie. In fact I would not put it to the level of The Hunger Games and I feel like it should be a better sequel. I have read a lot about the movie and I did like it and thought that it was good.|0
This was such a great film . It was done with such beautiful design , such symmetry . I love the way they did this movie . It was so great .I loved it . Thank you for making a great movie . Love you . Your work is too beautiful for me to describe . Keep up the beautiful work of you . I am really enjoying this film .I am happy that i have watched it .It was really beautiful .It made me happy .I am very happy . I am going to watch it all the way .|0
"It seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. Some manage to do so with great talent. Hervé Hadmar doesn't. On the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very ""décalé"" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade."|1
I do n't care what anyone says , this movie is hilarious ! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with the light-hearted humor of Home Alone . The characters are well fleshed out, and have some pretty funny dialog . It's not perfect by any stretch, but it works and has enough charm for me to watch every day . If you have never seen the movie , do yourself a favor and see this one for sure . I can't imagine anything that could have made it worse , and I am still in shock over how good the whole movie is .|0
Based on the comments made so far , everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . I don't know which it is. I've seen some very good and some really good reviews from people that are fairly well known in the industry and they seem pretty happy about it. I just read this review from a person that works in the industry and she has a great opinion of it and a lot of other people feel the same. I am going to see it and I hope I like the movie a lot.|0
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in San Jose. It's a musical, which normally I don't like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q & A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany!|1
"This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series, creepy beyond words. The tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed, in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie. This episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as ""Home"", ""Humbug"" ""Bad Blood"" and ""Milagro"" for being the best in their respective season.Mulder and Scully's growing relationship is put to the test in this episode: Can they really trust each other?"|1
I ca n't knock this film too terribly , because it 's obvious midway through the the watching of it, you 're not watching it as a film anymore. The action sequences are excellent , and the editing is well handled . I 've seen a few films these days where the editing is awful . But this movie is not one of them. It is the perfect blend of everything that I loved in the first film and all of the new and old things that have come along with it . You can 't really fault anything here except maybe the music .|0
Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders.|1
I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it.|1
"I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really too bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. Why Joe didn't just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode where the ""message"" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end I was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and I won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse."|1
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a father and daughter, a mother and son, a widow and a son, and the last remaining son of the town. The film is about the struggles of the family and the people who they meet and the love that binds them. As well, it deals with the issues that affect us all and the importance of family. I first learned of Lackawanna’s film when a friend forwarded me a link to the movie.|0
"This must be the most boring film I ever saw . The only positive I can say about it is that it has a happy ending . Not the usual happy endings for these type of films but it was a pleasant end to the film for me and I got the message of what would have happened in the film . The acting was fine but the script was just boring . And the ending was just so predictable . I felt bored to death . This was just the typical ""what would have been"" type of ending but it was boring to me as I said before ."|0
What a terrible misfire . Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda , one of the most famous and well-known films in the world . On a positive note the film was actually very good indeed . Not only the plot and the dialogue was interesting , the characters were well written , the performances were all excellent , and the direction was very good . The script was really good too with very well done characters and an interesting plot . The film is also a nice addition to the library and is a shame to miss out .|0
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics , it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable. Even the film itself seems to be a bit “sci-fi” like. I’m not entirely convinced that they had a point to it. As with any Frankenstein movie, the idea that all life on earth is the result of a genetic experiment is a bit off base. I don’t think that anyone would want to go out into the countryside and shoot all the trees in a given forest.|0

I 'm a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 's subgenres . Name one  I 've seen  and they are all terrible. The first  I saw  and I loved it . It wasn't that bad of a horror film  but there is one  and that  is terrible . I think I saw a couple  and they weren't good . The second one  I thought was really good , and that was the one  that is still my favourite , and I'm going to rewatch it one day . The second  I saw  was very scary .|0
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mark Dindal ) : Fast-paced , frantic animation effort by Ted Field to fill his time. It was good. I'd recommend it. ( Dir-Ron Miller ) : Good . In fact, it would be the best movie I've seen in recent memory. However , it had nothing new or exciting to offer . It was just old fashioned , but good. 1st watched 6/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 ( Dir-Denny O'Neill ) : I found the movie entertaining and educational. However , the movie was a bit too slow-paced for my liking.|0
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne , the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school . Daphne 's a good kid. She's athletic, athletic, athletic. Not the athletic types you find in the movies but that's okay because she's not the type of girl we'd normally think of. And it's not just her athletic talent that makes Daphne a great role model. She is also smart and independent. But she's just not quite the innocent you'd want to imagine for your next high school sweetheart .|0
This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. Yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm making out, but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.|1
^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap . Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for , they are the worst people on earth, they do not deserve to be here and they are the reason that I quit watching a movie because I could see how this movie ended . I will not give my review here but you can watch the first part to get a feeling of how the movie was and how bad it was and then you can go to the second part where it is not bad, the second and third part are not bad either, they're just not bad.|0
1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-John Waters ) : Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny moments. Not sure where it'll end but there's not a bad movie. 2/14/2008 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mitch Leibowitz ) : Terrible film from a terrible director, with terrible music. Not worth renting. 2/5/2007 - 5 out of 10 ( Dir-Robert Downey Jr.) : Not a good film but still watchable, with great music and some cool scenes. 3/5/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Downey Jr.) : Not a great film, but a decent movie.|0
"If you just want gore , and nothing but gore and torture , you 've come to the right movie. There are a million movies like this . You know that you have found something you 've been waiting for and you 've got your money's worth . __________________

The only thing I'm trying to do is make my life a living hell for those who don't have it and who think they 'll be okay when they are. I'll never get my money's worth for watching this , but I'm hoping that it does have a bit of a plot ."|0
This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better than this) and Blackadder (Not better than this).Mr Bean is a no talking, human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof.|1
"In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short, we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed ""Serpentine Dance"" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era."|1
`` The Moon Is Blue '' director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ''I Married a Communist'' about an alleged Communist family in Czechoslovakia who killed their son during the Prague Spring. When they were executed, Preminger decided to take the film to America in order to raise money for his family and the Czech film colony in the U.S. Premeditated murder in a communist society was a controversial topic for most Americans, and Preminger found the subject very difficult to broach, so the film was released in Europe as a silent film to avoid any controversy.|0
A few yrs ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that Rozzie R. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'.Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading.|1
"""The Racketeer"" stars Carol (deprived of the ""e"" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines."|1
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and I had read two books - 'A Voyage for Madmen' and 'The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst' before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece.|1
"The basic idea behind ""Dungeon of Harrow"" isn't all bad. The acting, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really isn't much there to recommend this film. You know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say ""Special Guest Star"" and list someone you've never heard of. Might as well say ""Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln."" because there's really no one in this movie you can identify."|1
"A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as mad. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals)."|1
I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well.|1
This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea.. However, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one.|1
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB). About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star Hugh Grant or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences.|1
Okay , so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to achieve a success as a filmmaker. But that is not enough for someone to succeed in the film business. He must know the right people and bring them into the picture. This is all a part of the success of the movie business. You must have a very clear picture of who you want to cast, who you want to play, and what they would be capable of doing. And if you haven’t figured it out, you are in for a rough ride on the career front.|0
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black.|1
THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes.|1
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it.she is 6 and she loved the film, some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was Eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was Jordan's video?! but she did enjoy it. i noticed the mistakes such as at the end Jordan was not actually playing the guitar, but she never.|1
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall . In many ways , this movie was much better than Moulin Rouge . 1. I can’t believe I actually had the pleasure to watch this. 2. This is not Moulin Rouge. This is the same Moulin Rouge you saw on stage. It is a different story, and I do not think it is worth comparing. 3. This is a French movie, and this is the same Moulin Rouge we are seeing on TV and in our living rooms.|0
As a fan of nearly any period drama, and at that a huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaption. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short. It felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtly to the relationships, particularly that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location. Despite having looked forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas I turned this off after an hour and went to bed.|1
"You can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this ""freedom fighter"" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murdering scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men, Women, AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar."|1
There 's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material . One of the few instances I can think of where Cheech & co. actually have a good idea. In the first video of this post we find them talking about their idea for a new TV series. It's a bit like a scene out of The Dark Knight Rises, which is probably the best movie I have seen in the last 12 years. The idea is to have their characters play video game characters and live together in a video game world.|0
( This has been edited for space ) Chan-wook Park 's new film is a complex film that is not really a mystery. In fact, I would say that I have no real clue as to what is going to happen on the film. This is the only explanation that I can come up with for any of the weird things that I see and hear as I go into the theater. I also have no idea what's going to happen the other night. That said, I would say that this film has a few different elements.|0
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while on an assignment for Germany.The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. I loved the film. Some will say it's a ""chick-flick,"" but so what. It's wonderful. Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped."|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen . If I was n't watching it for free , I probably would not give it a second thought . I just can't see the point . I can't even finish watching this movie and I know why. But it is so bad that I feel compelled to tell you this. If you haven't watched this, please do. It is the most disgusting movie ever made. I have seen worse, but I am not ready to see this yet . If I'm going to recommend this, I would recommend it to everyone.|0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Hans Keller - I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it.|1
Think Jumanji but with a death curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. Supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. Okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.Frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy has run but certainly its not the best.|1
This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie.|1
I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's Friend's House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, Anyone Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman.|1
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers , if garbage could ruin motion picture careers , you would have a ton of careers ruined by this garbage and would probably get your own film. I hope you are happy with your life as it is. I don't know how your career might have turned out if you hadn't gotten involved with this garbage. I hope your career was better than it is in the movies. If you can't get out of this mess, you are still in this mess.|0
This is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to Penthouse Serenade just as the opening premise (Hoppity's coming) may well have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name Disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect.|1
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago , Jr. and his family, their lives, and their extraordinary lives. Nanny is the best of us, the kind of nanny you want in your household, someone who’ll take on the mundane and make every moment of our lives count, someone who will take us out to dinner on the weekends and make dinner for our kids. She’s good-natured and easy-going, but at the same time, she doesn’t let life get the best of her.|0
An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people.This beautifully crafted horror well, actually it's more fantasy/romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life. Problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button.|1
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff ( splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne ) is the victim of a series of bizarre events. As his body is gradually decomposed by the mysterious forces that he has encountered, he is left stranded in a strange town on the outskirts of a strange village. It is here, with his new-found powers, that he encounters a small boy who is the last remaining human being in the place and who is now possessed by a mysterious creature from the depths of the Earth.|0
"Yah. I know. It has the name ""Sinatra"" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this thinking it was some movie I missed in the theaters. It's not. It's some garbage ""movie"" made by the folks at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! It's not good. I am as big a Sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb."|1
It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes , trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something much more. The plane, in particular, has long had a lot of appeal. I can recall sitting on an aisle seat as my father waited for us to catch our plane back to the UK. We were flying from Sydney to the USA and my father had told me that there were planes in Australia. My father is an Australian, and although he didn't know it, he was making an important statement.|0
I would just like to point out ( in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD and Blu-Ray), that if you like this, you should consider buying a Blu-Ray or HD DVD version. The DVD versions are out of print and are being sold at very high prices. This series is definitely worth your time to watch or re-watch - but if you have the money and can't justify getting it on DVD (or there are special circumstances) then consider buying a HD DVD version. I think the series is worth watching, and I have already re-watched most of the series.|0
"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from ""evidence"" to ""violence,"" I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money."|1
Having just watched Acacia , I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here . I like many of these movies but if you want to see what I have been saying for years , don't bother . I loved all of those films but I enjoyed it even more after rewatching the movies on DVD , so I feel that it is my fault . If you think the movie was better off on DVD , because the film has a better story or better special effects , well, I would agree with you.|0
"This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended , I was seething with anger, rage and hate. What happened was this

1. I’m angry and I want to beat the fuck out of the people who pulled that off
2. I’m not a fan of the film and it has a lot of flaws that I can’t accept and I think it should be left alone
3. My family, friends, and anyone who was there who was offended by the film will never get over the film
4."|0
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen ""Dahmer"" (2002) I can say that following what the media put out about Jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. I have studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood."|1
This film , also known as `` do n't look in the basement '' is actually not bad . It is not that bad . it is actually really good . The idea behind the movie , which is directed, written and edited by Joss Whedon , is to make a satire about modern society . A lot has already been said about the movie . The problem with making a satire is that there is so much that has not yet been said , but we have plenty of time . We have already seen what is the movie . We know what is going to happen .|0
Admittedly , when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie , my expectations were pretty low. After all, it was well known that the movie was a rip off from the popular film , The Last Emperor. So when I finally went and saw the movie, there was a lot of hype , and I was really wondering whether the movie was worth the watch. So I decided to give the movie a chance and now I have decided to give it a star out of five. The story itself is not very good at all.|0
Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house.|1
Just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . Take Mike Myers , for example . First of all , he doesn’t seem to know the first thing about acting . Second of all , his acting is so bad it is unbelievable . And he makes it look so easy . There is so much stuff going on in this movie that you really cannot see it for yourself . If you are going to laugh at something , you better be laughing at the wrong stuff . Just watch the movie , there are a lot of laughs .|0
"It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. This movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. The box lies, this is no ""erotic thriller"", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. This movie fails in pretty much every way."|1
Anyone that is looking for an episode of `` Law and Order '' or `` CSI '' would have to wait. In fact, I was at the library recently and had the opportunity to browse through some old episodes of those series to see what it was like in the early 80's. And it was, indeed, kind of interesting. And it made me feel that I missed out on one of my childhood favorites. This is because there were some things that just had to be said about the legal system of the day in this particular episode.|0
"Why do people make bad movies ? Did n't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making was bad ? And why don't they have any other ideas ? Well they did have a big idea in their minds but they were just wasting their time and money

You are welcome. But I'm talking about the films of the last 2 years or so, that are still being made and released by the makers of the movies you've mentioned. Some movies are terrible in my opinion. There is no doubt about it."|0
This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norris's best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks.|1

"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but I must say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, yet all is not as it seems; a sort of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things an people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis, and thought, ""this can't be the whole reason?"""|1
Watching the first few moments , you realize it 's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is*. I won't spoil any of it for those that haven't already seen the first film - and that includes you - but here are some of my favourite lines from it that I've picked out to use in the trailer. It should be fun - just don't spoil it. It's just that simple! So, what is the movie about? We get the first part of this movie a few years after the last one was released.|0
Despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just because it’s entertaining enough to make you turn the damn thing off the first time you see it. The basic premise is set in the year 2046, and it’s being directed by James Cameron ( who wrote most of the film’s story and was credited with co-producing the film ) who also produced it. While it’s being filmed at Universal Studios Florida, a few scenes are also being filmed on location in San Francisco.|0
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean.|1
There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims.|1
I 've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie , But Just The Half . Because I Only Watched It In VH1 . I've Seen The Muppet Movie To The Part That I Like .

I Just Don't Really Like Muppets On Comedy .|0
My favourite movie of all time . This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary made me like the film even more. I’d like to go through the various scenes and explain what went on. The whole film is based on the murder of three teenagers in 1968 in a housing estate in central Rome. The film is based on the book, “I mio figlio” which was written by the son of the three victims. The film takes place in 1968, when these three boys were killed. It takes place over about 3 hours.|0
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . i have not made one movie yet which i know to be bad . i will not make another and i will not be making a film like that again. that is not the way to be making a movie . and that is not a message that we want to give out. but that is the truth and that is the message we have to tell . so there you have the truth as we see it . and to give us an example i will just show you one.|0
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have been much better in the hands of a director such as Steven Spielberg. And it is very interesting that this film, which was directed by Howard Hawks, was originally produced by the legendary Hawks himself. I also think that Hawks’ career has suffered as a result of the film. It was also one of my favorite films of all time, not just because it is a classic film, but also for the reason that, although it had a number of great parts, it was never a great movie.|0
"How sad it is when a film as wonderful as ""Jurassic Park"" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name."|1
There was no need for this movie , plain and simple . The original , although hated by some , is loved by many. I loved the first one and still enjoy it every year. And I also enjoyed the first two movies. So I thought I’ll see if there is anyone else that likes this movie. I can only say that as a fan of the series, there are a few who still hate this movie and others that loved it. So if anyone else is going to give a good review , then please do.|0
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie this is down right awful. After reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews were so right. I totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow.|1
"After a meteorite lands in `` Boston '' ( really somewhere in the Isle of Man ) , a hideous creature takes over the area. Its name is Vampira . It kills its victims with vampire bat slugs . Vampira is a vampire who was born to kill . She is the vampire queen of the Isle of Man who is in fact a vampire from the first film, but this was never explained in the movie, so the title was an invention . This title was changed to the Isle of Vampire in the original version of the movie in which it was called "" The Vampire Queen ""."|0
"Jerk hazer Mike(David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam(Caleb Roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. They get PO'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty(Kristina Sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."|1
this film sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards? I couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes their entire armoury and disappears again!! Nice work if you can get it. It's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. Arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film.|1
Okay, that was just brilliant. I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong. It really needed more episodes like this. The cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. Writing was fantastic and so was the editing. Great job in all accounts. The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. Which is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but failed until now. The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being this good.|1
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough.|1
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent.|1
2001 : A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon ? An account of the history of mankind ? An exploration into the mystery of man ?

A detailed account of the most significant discoveries made in the last few years of man ? The creation of man and a short explanation of the beginning of life of this new creation ?

An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea , May 1891 ' . A small lifeboat is being launched. We see the sea is rough and there are several other lifeboats on board. The boat is being pushed off the deck of a ship into the ocean. The boat is headed towards shore. We see a group of men loading their lifebelts in a rowboat. One of them, with his lifebelts secured, climbs into the rowboat. We see a woman holding a bucket and the boat is being pushed towards a beach. Suddenly the rowboat is spotted.|0
Low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The alluring Tania Frankenstein(Sara Bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux.|1
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons , I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might have lingered for me. This was the first time I’d read a book with so many characters, and there were so many I didn’t expect would be friends with one another. It’s nice to meet new people. So, what’s new today? Well, you know what’s coming next. But, for now, just remember that the next chapter is out! (I hope you all like the sneak preview, because I do!|0
"I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another ""Biblical"" film again, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. Hello? EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to scripture."|1
I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic , sexual , crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this. It didn't disappoint. It was not, as I had hoped, what I had come to Expect. It was better, but not as good as I hoped it would be. In fact, I found it to be a lot less than it needed to be, more than I would have expected from this production, much less what the producers were going for. The story is set in a fictional, small town in Kentucky.|0
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair).|1
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity . My friends and I went to the cinema to watch this movie in the hope it would be as good as it's reputation. We were shocked when we actually got to see this movie in cinemas instead of the usual movie theater. We could not believe the terrible acting, the bad CGI and the mediocre story line. This is one of those movies that you either love, or hate, depending on your tolerance for bad special effects, bad CGI and bad storytelling.|0
I love most movies and I 'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least read a review of the book that he wrote (The Life of Sean Bean). It is a collection of some of his greatest work (all of which I own) and some of his greatest failures (which are all in the book). It is a very long book but I really enjoy reading it because it shows me that Sean is a writer who has learned from his bad movies and has tried to improve.|0
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning: a lot of dialogue. And while there are some good bits of dialogue to be found, overall there was really little for the audience to focus on. It makes it hard to get into a character and feel like you really understand him/her and his/her world. In fact, I found myself feeling like I knew the film's backstory a little bit before I saw most of it and even before I saw the movie.|0
Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context.|1
"This movie took me by surprise. I first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. It's got it's just plain boring points, and I, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, ""What the hell is this?"|1
Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime pictures (particularly Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need, and was ahead of its time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-WW2 France. Its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off.|1
After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY ( which is still my favorite Dassin ) I was more excited than ever to get to see THE MUMMY. It is not that I have not had my share of horror flicks in the past (I still do ) but to see a film from director James McTeer that was not just about the sex but the horror and that was more than I ever got from Dassin. I would have loved to have seen a scene where the mommy is being killed by the monster but alas, I was not going to get anything more out of that film.|0
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on a couple of blogs here and here. The main problem with this argument is that DOGS (and other people like him) aren't the ones creating the content. The article itself was posted on the R DOGS website, which in turn is managed by someone who isn't R DOGS and is using the R DOGS name. I don't care what the actual author says or believes. I'm here to discuss things and get a lot of disagreement and disagreement that is based on facts and good logic.|0
Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance . Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said in an article that the title is a bit of an ego contest. That’s because it has a big price tag on it, and he thinks it’s for the best. But what do you really think? You could be the next champion. We all have our favorites. Who do you like? How do they compare to the other champions? The next question is how long does it take to achieve a certain rank in the ranks?|0
"This is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word ""credit"" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman."|1
The core issues at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film). End of Days, unfortunately, is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon. Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time , I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this shit, it's like she has some mental problem. She has no talent and she doesn't need to be told how to dress. She has some talent and if she wants to be a singer she should go for it and take the opportunity to prove it. There is nothing sadder than a girl who cant sing. She has no self respect. She has no talent and no one will listen to her, she doesn't need to be listened to she can sing for herself.|0
Predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page.|1
"Like a lot of people, I loved the original; ""American Graffiti"" was one of the great movies of the 70s. The sequel, ""More American Graffiti"" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. It wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as ""Laurie's"" character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and ""Terry the Toad"" and ""Pharaoh Joe"" somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam)."|1
"I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up . I was greeted with an ""unknown"" writer with an accent who said he had no idea who the character was and he had no credits. The description on IMDb was that this was a musical adaptation with a story about a man and a woman who meet at an art class. He then says he did not know any of the other actors and that the show did not go through the usual stages of writing and auditioning etc."|0
"A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley and have to be rescued by an old friend who's come to town for a weekend. It was made for TV as a pilot for a movie, not for theatrical distribution but I never did see it, so maybe someone else out there did. There is a scene at the beginning of the first film, when they are just starting out from the beginning, and one of them is saying, ""I'd like to see a movie."""|0
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel . Kennedy was a well known good writer but it was his movies that had the most commercial success. In the late 90's he made 4 of the top 10 fastest movies of all time as a director and a producer. I think this film could have been the most popular film made by him if he was more willing to learn from past mistakes but he didn't. So if he made this movie I think it would be a lot more enjoyable to see it. It is well worth watching for this alone!|0
...and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. Some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. A lot of people think Troma's Terror Firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but I'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck.|1
Personally , I have no problem with the acting , nor the script . I do have a problem with the characters , who should not have even been allowed to make it out of the studio . I am so angry , when i hear this crap on the radio , on the radio, and then read it on sites like this one , when they are trying to explain it all , it is as if they didn’t even see it , and are still trying to get people to buy into it. I will be watching the show to see if anyone is able to pull this off.|0
"This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank , a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo . Kingsley's career took off as a child actor with a small role in the 1973 movie of the same name . He is then cast as the main antagonist in the 1982 crime film . Kingsley has appeared in such films as ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" (1987), which was a box-office success, and ""Bloody Disgrace"" (1991), for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination ."|0
Wow! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) Terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. Lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film.|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film.|1
"""The Planet"" is an astounding piece of film making. For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original sci-fi films for a long time.Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well planned action. From the opening space battle, to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above it's budget.To start with the special effects, while certainly not ""Revenge Of The Sith"" standard, they are on level, if not above, the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape."|1
Watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav...(realized then I should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot...India v Pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian super hero goes on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. I left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place.|1
"This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . Its been a few years since I saw it but I still remember the first time I saw it, I thought, ""How could they do this to a good man?"" and that got me to thinking about it. After that it was hard to stay mad at it but I think I've got to do my part to make it right. That being said it's not for everyone. I don't like that it's about a serial killer."|0
"I watched this film last night , i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got scared , i got scared by the scenes in this film i felt like i was going to die or something .i thought i was gonna die and i still think that , but atleast now i think that is a good thing and if i didnt die , i would not be so scared now

Well, i thought that was good . i could see it. i was not going to rent this movie if it was real . and i'm glad that you enjoyed it."|0
As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it 's not going to contain any historical inaccuracies, and is just a movie about what happens next, you have no problems. But what you don't know is that the whole ' movie is not a 'true' story. And that makes you question if you have the proper knowledge to enjoy it. I say that 's because I had read the novel, but not the movie. It does have a pretty good storyline, but it is one that you have to see to believe.|0
This movie 's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free , and that it gave me something to do. I think if you don't own a movie theater you are going to have a tough time getting a ticket, especially in this economic climate. The other thing that the movie has is that you are treated to a really great soundtrack in this movie. If you can get the soundtrack then you're in good shape, otherwise I'd say it's a very bad movie. I've never seen anything like it.|0
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. This is my second trip to this film, and I am in awe of this director's talent. It has been well over a decade since I watched it in theaters, and the quality is so much better today. It's been awhile, and I know I haven't read this review by now, but I'm going to get it now since I am going to the theater to see it. I have to admit that there are some things about this film that are a bit off.|0
Just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review? Yeah.I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to put into the script. I doubt it'll be published considering how poorly I worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. The sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.|1
"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous rift, a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"".The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife."|1
I ca n't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb . Of course , if you think it isn't a masterpiece, then go back and click on the ratings to check out some other movies of this type. But, for me, I was blown away by this movie , and I really don't think that it is going to get much better in the future. Of course, it won't take long for someone to find out that this movie was a big flop, but it is certainly a very well put together movie.|0
I was waiting for this movie for a time . In the first day of the air in Turkey , I was waiting to watch it in the cinema . Then on the day I came , I went to my office . Then I started to go to my office . It is my office , but I didn’t come to work . It was in the afternoon . On the other side of the office , there was a window , and I could see the sky and the clouds in front of it . My wife was working at the time . I said to myself .|0
I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war.|1
I love this movie . Yes , the main character lies , but that 's why it 's called ``. . . a ``. . . a love story . ''. But there are no words to describe the acting. And the film is very funny . Well , it's a comedy movie. It doesn't matter if it 's a funny movie , or not , it's still a great movie . The only reason why the movie doesn't earn a lot of awards is that there are no awards awarded for a movie that can't make you laugh and that's all it takes .|0
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time when I was young and foolish enough to think that the only thing I wanted was for my mother to be there. Her absence was a burden I had never really accepted; I had always imagined that if she could not be here then something had gone wrong in my relationship with her. This film was the first of its kind I was ever aware of; not a film that was based on true facts. It was a fiction and was set in the early 1930s.|0
It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors.|1
The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate ( i.e . ground , air , and space operations ) over the entire period of the Cold War. The second season essentially covered the events that happened after the Korean War. This is a story that deals with the Marines from the Cold War to Vietnam. It has been a while since this story was aired, but there were enough details about the period of time that I was able to watch the second season and put it away. I have now re-run the whole show and am glad I did.|0
"I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say ""Like Pelswick"" and go on with what ever he was originally doing."|1
"Worst movie ever seen . Worst acting too . I can not imagine a movie worse then this . Nothing good there. I was so disappointed that this movie ended up being one of my top 10 best movies EVER . I think that was one of the worst parts of it. I just cant wait to hear what people think about it and how they really felt when they first saw it. It was so bad to see. I think most of you did too . I dont care what you think of it I just don't care

It was so bad that I was so sad when the movie ended."|0
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich, and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly prejudiced against the 'goy' characters -- content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures -- and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with.Feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine, and start dealing honestly with issues.|1
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it 's not without trying. It's just that, it seems to me, it's not trying hard enough to win back some of its early critics, who thought it had 'solved all its problems on its way into the theaters, which was the only way to make sure it could deliver its promised blockbuster. This is especially true for an indie, which the first time around is not a sure bet that audiences will be satisfied by the film, but that there's still some hope for the company.|0
"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his ""wedding."" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The ""joke"" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his ""bits and pieces."""|1
I 'm glad they finally released it on DVD . I bought the video tape years ago and watch it every time I'm out on the street to get rid of stuff in the garage. It was the first video I ever watched on VHS but my first experience with VHS. But I also watched them in high school and they're still quite popular, so that made it a great learning tool. It's very fun to see how people's reaction when they first see this movie. I hope they make a DVD/Blu Ray version that I can watch a second time with my kids!|0
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. I've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.The acting's all good and the direction very solid. The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?|1
Firstly, I am a huge fan of crap films. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is just plain bad. I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning, it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot.|1
"To paraphrase Thora Birch: ""I kind of like this movie. It's the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film"".This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD, you could do a lot worse."|1
a great movie, with a rather unclear political message. it´s shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear, but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie.|1
OK, so maybe it's because I'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like the guys in this film, but I found this great fun. Cheap fun to be sure, but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually quite effected when they died. In particulare when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well it;s a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered.|1
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness . The water is crystal clear , nor cold . A giant robotic fish is taking a swim , and no one noticed . But then one woman noticed .

"First of all , since I 'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this, let me explain...

First off, there was a MST3K fan site that put together a version of the show that was basically an episode on the show. (I'm sure this was just a one time event) But, as a fan that loved the series and had always wondered, if the show existed, would it have aired on a syndicated network, or did the show really exist, only to get cut apart into episodes that never really aired?"|0
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it and I've always had a soft spot for her.Basically, the owner of a book store, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it.|1
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time , I was n't expecting a show with complex characters and a very unique style. It took me almost 3 hours to finish the first episode, which is probably a better way to define this show. It was not easy. In fact, I didn't make it until episode 4 before I had to go back to watch episode 5, because I didn't understand the whole episode, which I didn't see in the first episode. And then, I had to re-watch the entire show again.|0
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your films with a guy you can root for, and relate to, if you like your films in black and white, you gotta see this film! Watch it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a beat. It is sometimes slow, and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen, then when the plot begins to unfold, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was!|1
A rather mild horror movie ; if not for a couple of sex scenes , it could easily have been a romantic thriller ; if only it had some good character development, it could have been something a lot better, something with a bit more meat. I suppose that the horror genre needs more and more of this, especially in a genre that has the ability to deliver a ton of action and excitement. It can be difficult to keep the suspense up long enough for all of the main characters to have a good emotional experience.|0
"Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films, and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the ""Wanted"" signs. The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene at the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking, as sound is never something you needed with him."|1
Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless cliché. Leconte doesn't waste time trying to prove his point - he wastes his talent as a filmmaker by allowing the camera to do the talking. At the time of shooting, I was in the midst of filming my first film, and Leconte was producing and starring in another feature film. He was not available to chat to me about the second film; nor was I ready to chat with him about the first film.|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin.|1
"This film easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of ""12 Angry Men"". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie."|1
Surprisingly well-acted , well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom : his favorite heavy metal band. Directed by Mike Clattenburg . Stars James Franco , Nick Kroll , Kevin Pollak and Rob Corddry . Gives plenty of insight about why James Franco chose to become a star and the reasons behind it, including the fact that his dad was a very successful video-game player and that he wasn't the most popular kid growing up and that his girlfriend was pregnant at the time, which made him so popular, it made his mom very angry.|0
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the '90s (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."""|1
Talk about creepy . If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was dating her boyfriend for over a year starts to suspect something is going on in the background you will find a lot in this video that makes the show worth watching. Just remember to be careful of what you want to be watching at the end, as it could very well be one of the creepiest videos I’ve ever seen. “I love you. I don’t know if I love you back… I just wanna be with you, you know.|0
I saw this film via one of the actors ' agents , and it surely conforms with a great deal . the story is very well constructed , the cast are all very believable and the acting is fine . if there has been any mistake , it seems to be only minor , because this is one of the most well known films of the 1970s . but the film is very weak . the story begins in the early 1960s , and is told in first person . in the story a group of teenagers , who are studying to become lawyers , set out on a trip through the desert in the early 1970 s .|0
When I first heard about `` Greek , '' I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous . But I knew that was just a hype and I decided to give it a chance since I wasn't a die hard fan of the show . So I got to the first episode , and the first two episodes I thought it was going to be boring . Now that the third episode started , I knew that the show was going to be so funny , and I was pretty happy about that . Well I wasn't so happy about that . And I was disappointed .|0
"Oh, my. Oh, this is a *really* bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.What does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. ""Oh, s/he died? Huh... Figured they would"" was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who."|1
I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The acting is good and the story line was OK except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.The film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. It has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for Ash Christian I thought it was good.|1
`` The next Karate Kid '' is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises . It has a very simple story with a couple of very memorable characters . The plot is not complex but there are many twists you will enjoy . The movie is a real heartbreaker . It's a good movie for the karate-jitsu fans who want to know what goes on behind the scenes . The karate kiddies love it because karate is not a sport , it is the way to defend yourself , protect yourself , and make sure your family are safe . Karate Kid is really a movie that is a must see .|0
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy.|1
A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away ( sound familiar ) , water has become the fuel to power the sun , creating all things on earth in the process . . . and now , it has been revealed that some of that water might actually be made from the radioactive waste of a star that exploded over a quarter-million years ago . . . The explosion is believed to have been so massive that it created a massive shockwave , which is what is left over after the original star explodes as a result of it's own thermonuclear reaction . . .|0
ExCUSE me , but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o ' poop . But I'll do my best to bring it back up in a little while. You have to remember that in this day in age that's a really big deal . And, I'm sorry but it doesn't come around often that we get to spend our time and talents in the spotlight . So I'm sorry . But it is time. It has to come . I'm sure you are all very happy to hear it . But you know what .|0
If this movie would have been in English , all critics would have trashed it . The language is extremely difficult . I don't know why the film has been released . Maybe because it is not good . Maybe it is not even good . Perhaps, it's because people have a problem with it . It's not good . One thing, that I believe, is extremely important . There was a great writer in the late 80s and 90s in France , called Jean-François, who wrote some really good short films. He became a cult figure , and all his films were banned .|0
I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD, particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, particularly at the finale.I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is just so so lame compared with the original. What where they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the finale?|1
"Okay, enough. Every time I think I've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that I think that no one could possibly find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual inane ""Undiscovered masterpiece"" ""GREAT film"" - I mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox/MGM/UA DVD. There are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning."|1
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. You get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, I imagine that caves are dark.|1
"Somehow, I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert,(Diana Pennington),""Thank You, Good Night"",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain."|1

The film has an incredible story and an incredible cast. Here's a brief list of all of the actors who played a key role in the film. In addition, it was directed by a master of the art.|0
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title ""Acrobatty Bunny"", it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that, it's quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in ""Big Top Bunny""."|1
"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of her husband. That’s when she realizes it. “If I was a girl,” she writes, “my parents would have wanted me to do things like this. Because I’m not supposed to get married and get pregnant!”

But it’s true. As a 16-year-old in her small town, she was “trying to get pregnant.”

It happened twice. Once she slept with her school teacher, and another time she tried to have a baby."|0
Normally I am a typical `` creepy-crawly-hatin ' '' girl , but after watching this film ( on YouTube of course ) I was really impressed with this film . its a movie that has a story that makes you want to check it out every time you watch it because its so well done . it has a plot , a few characters , a few plot twists , and some really cool and unique ideas . the film starts out with a girl coming home to her house in her bathrobe , and her parents asking her to tell them why she is in the bathrobe .|0
Before you watch this movie - clean your ears, take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life-long enough. If you're Jew/Russian/Ukrainian/immigrant - yes, what popular-movie-minority so ever - laugh within your memories. If you're something else or whatever your are anyway - laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family. It this movie, nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem.|1
Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through.|1
This is my first Deepa Mehta film . I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its subtitles and it was excellent. I wish that I can see this film again on TV. The film is about life of a child in an arranged marriage. I have just seen this movie in the Tamil version with its subtitle and it was better than this film. The film starts off with the child being separated from his mother and he goes to live with his aunt. He meets his friend, Anand, who is from a rich family but his father has not come back to him.|0
This was my late wife 's favorite film . I 'm sorry she did not live long enough to have seen it. I 'm sure I will enjoy it one day . I do not watch movies . It is not that I have anything against movies but I cannot stand to see all of them . The only exception is when I can 't wait for one to start, but that is rarely the case. The story is about a woman who is involved in a gang fight and goes to a psychiatrist . The doctor prescribes her a pill and tells her that she 's had a few bad trips.|0
I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.What I AM bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL of the episodes were staged. Hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.The premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer.|1
"Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.This film is about a young boy, Alejandro ""Ale"" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar ""Izzie"" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (that I did not even know existed--Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops."|1
"One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings, and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse).The story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. It may be a little below ""Seabiscuit"", but not a lot."|1
Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious.|1
I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable.|1
"Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist ( Mike Connors ) who wants to prove his innocence and get the world to know why he has disappeared. It's also a time of rising tensions in the country and, with the help of a secret agency, Mitchum investigates a series of brutal murders that link to a power struggle for the government. Along the way his personal life is brought into focus. The film's title comes from an expression, the phrase ""kill the messenger,"" used by gangsters to intimidate potential informants and informants in turn intimidate other gangs."|0
"The movie is nothing extraordinary. As a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...It's just another case of ""another teenage horror movie""-seen one and you've seen em all. First few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. The worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. Would have been better if it's written in Spanish."|1
"The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. It's because this film was only made PARTLY in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3.I have a confession to make. ""Carnosaur 2"" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just WORKS for me."|1
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. But, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town.|1
"I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.The dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?It felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. The stereotypes and jokes about ""men's groups"" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.Apart from the attractive Irish man - this film was a dud."|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years . It was about the late 1960s when I was 17 and I found out that I was deaf. I had not really had any issues when it came to using the phone or any other type of communication in general but when I met my first deaf friend for the first time I found I could hear him clearly and I was immediately hooked. We talked for a long time about this and it brought up some of the things I had gone through in my life.|0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment. We all have seen this film, know it's a shambolic mess of a film, and are expected to love it. But that's really not the point. The point is, the film is a complete and utter failure. The premise is that an evil demon called a demon child or demon baby makes an appearance and kidnaps a young boy. He then proceeds to murder the boy's entire family and take the boy to an occult shrine that's supposed to be located in a castle.|0
"This film gives new meaning to the term ""uneven"", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him."|1
This is a film that has to be taken in context . It should n't be seen unless you 've got the money . I have the money but I want you to take it on faith . I'm not going to get involved in the film and I'm not going to take a risk . This is the kind of movie that can be seen on the big screen . That's not the fault of the film's director . He made his movie with that in mind . I'm not saying this is the best film you will ever see .|0
... than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie . What was the motive ? The details of the plot are known. It was to create an illusion of a happy ending. It never happened. A couple of things you may ask. What does this mean ? It has to be mentioned that all the main characters of this movie were played by the same guy who made this movie. It was Michael Cimino. His name was played in the title screen . He was a major player in the movie industry and had many friends. But not only this he was a bad actor .|0
"This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the exercise of public power which are essential to any form of government. I should also make reference to A.N. Whitehead in his ‘The Social Problem’ which was published in 1933.”



And what is the most important point you make here? That the state can function as a form of private power? What I think is wrong with this argument is that the state’s functions in society have been made more complex by the fact that the private state is more complicated in its structure."|0
Bought for £1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. PV is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.A vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control.|1
"An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the film she ""throws back"" the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur! The high-toned English set she moves in is such a clichéd bunch of harummpf-ers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! ""My violeen! How weel I ever play eet again!"" ""Patreecia, my meelk is cold!"" It's campy beyond belief."|1
I think the `` Bone Snatcher '' should go after anyone associated with this movie . Watching this will seem like a fun movie . There are a couple of flaws that will make it a bore . But for the most part you will find that this movie has a great storyline and it's well acted . If you're a fan of the series then there's no reason not to check it out . I would say that I would like to see this movie a bit further down the road . There's still much to be seen and explored .|0
Sweet , rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him they kick her out. She comes up to town to start a new life with this guy but finds that he’s got more in common with her than she’d originally thought, as he seems to be a good catch. They become good friends despite her snobby ways but things take a turn for the worse when she finds out her crush is also in town and she must decide between being friends or trying to see what the attraction really is.|0
"I just saw this movie for the second time . I first saw it back in the mid-90 's as a young kid and then when I was a teenager in the mid '90s . I did like the original but I found the movie kind of over the top , which is why I haven't liked it very much since and I've just finished it up . I'll tell you a bit more about it

It's not so much of a sequel to the original , but rather a prequel which tells the story of a young college kid who discovers that he's a mutant from a mutant world ."|0
After watching this film, I thought to myself, they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really nice eye candy. They really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of Hollywood just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.Why am I critiquing this film? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver.|1
What is this ! ! its so bad . The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 remake . I've never seen such awful animation with such awful characters and dialogue ! It's so hard to tell if the actor's voice was in real-time or not , its just a mess , and it makes me sad . You could always just go to the net and see if there's any of these animations . I don't have time to do so. I have to do my school work in time . But thanks for the link .|0
"I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow, I've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up very much into punk rock, and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. Not every punk song incorporates ""Oi!"" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion."|1
The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. But the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. And, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers filmed mostly in Russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability.|1
First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I have watched it almost 10 times just because I've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece.The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert.|1
"Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film ( except note that it needs a DVD player). In this blog post you’ll find: a review of the film and how to watch it, a comparison of the film to some of your favorite horror movies, a short description of each of the actors, and some additional information you need to know. All this stuff can be found on the movie review. Enjoy

A review of a film which is in my opinion the perfect example of how horror movies work."|0
"I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of ""Grand Champion"" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her images were used for PR."|1
"Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough? ), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!)"|1
Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire , and , as always, very good soundtrack ! The movie is a mix between old war movies (one of them, I can remember from the late sixties/ early seventies, about a bunch of soldiers fighting in the jungle in a country far away) and modern action movies with an occasional bit of comedy thrown in here and there to keep things interesting. This time, the action was in the jungles of Vietnam. The movie tells a story of the two main characters in the movie, an older man and his wife.|0
This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.The cast are good though, Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome A.J.|1
"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""Letyat zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the verge of WWII. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war starts. Boris is promptly sent off to war. Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son, whom she does not love."|1
They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.OK, the plot. Some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there are no more.Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent.|1
Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal , Stallone , Willis , et al -- manage to survive for so long despite being the cream of the crop of American actors and directors? There's a good explanation for that too. In this series, I'll take a look at how these guys became actors and directors. I've always been curious about this. I've seen and read interviews with a lot of different people from every walk of life. But I always have wondered how these guys became successful, or, more importantly, why they are still alive today.|0
I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. This show had potential to be good. But my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in every episode.|1
This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge, the Sargent, the kid, the creepy old lady, the slut, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way... never give your patient an ax! This was before Cukkos Nest, AND surpasses it.|1
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels . There were loose ends with the writing and plotline but in general it failed to hold my attention. Even though I found the actors in the film to be great , they lacked chemistry with one another and the film was too long and boring at the end . A film like that should have been shorter and more entertaining . I have a soft spot for this type of film and after seeing this I'm hoping to see another sequel. This is not a review about this film .|0
"I 'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR ! ! ! I did buy this film for a dollar and I can tell you that it is a great film. I don't see what the big deal is. Everyone's got to do everything on his own, no one is going to force you to see a certain movie. If you didn't like it, you could just walk out. I don't even know what it is, but that's not the point...

And I was going to buy this, too. The reviews are all positive."|0
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy.They're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex.|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist.|1
Definition of documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and barely learned a thing about them.The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anybody and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And is listening to people recite TMBG lyrics like they were supposed to be funny/interesting? It was neither.|1
The concept : show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together of the week. The first two families have already arrived at the get-together, which is just starting, but they've already set the scene. Next up, two families are about to depart on holiday, one from England and the other from Canada, and then two more are about to leave to go on their own vacation. Then two families from the same city, Los Angeles, will leave, and then there are two more from another city, San Jose.|0
Spoilers . This review has been edited due to word limit. ` The horror . The horror . ' Marlon Brando is in the final stretch of his life as an actor. It's not the end, but it is the beginning. The movie is not about him but about him and about what happened to him during the last six months of his life and what his death will mean, not just to those who know him but to those who have never known him or to those for whom the movie is being made.|0
"""River's Edge"" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw ""Blue Velvet"", you know thats saying something. Viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated ""Kids"". The previews for ""Kids"" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. ""River's Edge"" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better."|1
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that ""cranked out"" is written all over this production. Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent."|1
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote . I 've seen neither of those films. They have their merits. But they aren't Chop Shop. And in my opinion, Chop Shop is better than neither of them. It's about a man who tries to change the world but ends up destroying a lot of what he wants. It's a story that could easily have ended up being too depressing. I can't say I'm disappointed with Chop Shop, but it wasn't a movie that excited me.|0
This is pure CRAP , and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever ... Absolutely inaccurate , I mean , seriously , why do they do this ? I'll give you an example , if that is ok , I'll write a review for this film in an hour. But for now , lets go to their website, which has the trailer and the plot for the film. Now the plot and trailer is a bit long but I'm gonna write the plot first anyway , because of the length that they are not going to take you for the story.|0
"""Black Dragons"" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him."|1
One should not be too critical about the director's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.However, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.Any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.|1
Hey guys and girls ! Do n't ever rent , or may God forbid , buy this piece of garbage ! I'm just glad it didn't get deleted . Now I have to buy it on Amazon if I want it to stay on the site ! You may not like me, but at least you should know something ! I like this piece of shit ! What can I say ? It doesn't help me to get my money back when I'm not sure I'll be able to read it myself. That's what I've been told, and it's the same story from this one as well !|0
This isn't a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties.|1
I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, though. Maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime.|1
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. And of course us Americans just have to remake everything successful into English, because man reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard isn't it! From what I've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant Jessica Alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) It looks EXACTLY the same but probably w/double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks I have seen in any language in quite a long while.|1
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain Nolte. Foprget questioning anyone. Nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. His methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut.|1
This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.Some matches were a complete waste of time.|1
Honestly - this short film sucks . the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still has the same issue as many of the short movies Ive seen. The dummy looks like it should be used as a stand up and I dont really know why it is the way it is. I know the director used it because his wife asked him why the dummy was in the scene. In all honesty I think this short has a lot to offer as a short but it's not a great one. This is definitely not something you'd want to see more than once.|0
To put it simply , this was a pompous piece of canine poopie . Overly stagey and everyone being the center of attention. It just didn’t have the same impact and it was such a boring film that i couldn’t care one whit either way . The acting and directing was pretty bad , but then you’ve seen a lot of bad movies these past few years and some of the best ones are still made with bad acting . It’s kind of sad , i can’t wait to see the movie with a good director and actors .|0
I don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki...) someday will direct the REAL Neverending story.|1
I was really beginning to enjoy this show . It just started out slow and it was n't given the time to play around with. The story was very intriguing and I loved all of the side characters who were just so well-rounded. The music was also great! It's very hard to do an awesome soundtrack when you're watching a TV show that's been out for years. My husband and I both loved this show. We watched it for a couple of weeks before going on vacation so we didn't miss much of it but we did come home with a couple of DVDs and we still watched this.|0
"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just a look at his new film, ""Everything is Illuminated"", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector."|1
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.|1
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess , horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal 's latest works , this one has Snipes being chased by his ex-wife , then being shot by his wife in a jealous rage and finally being dragged away by the police and forced into a life of crime . In other words , it has been some time since we have heard about Snipes in action and we have only just now come to expect this sort of thing . As it turns out , it has been a long time and this film is only a part of it .|0
I love his martial arts style , it is quick , close up and oh so fast , but it is also extremely effective , I use it all the time , I also like the way he moves so fast , it is like you are watching the movie you know the whole time . I want to try his style. I can't find any videos of it. What are some good videos to see him move. I am interested in seeing how he does it. I would love to see him move like he does in a movie. Thanks.|0
`` The Apartment Complex '' is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story. The story of the movie starts out in the 1950's with the two main characters, John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe, playing a couple in their early 20's on their way to marriage. They have been married before and both of them know what the other person wants. This is the perfect setting for a movie with a happy ending. As the movie unfolds, the story evolves and eventually it reaches a conclusion.|0
"Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. ""Mostly Martha"" or ""Bella Martha"" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, to the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original."|1
A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore . However , it is the case for a horror film like the above that you don’t need a budget to create a movie that will be a hit regardless of what it costs to make it. That is what makes it so great. The only reason it may not be as cheap as others is because it was written and directed by a guy who actually cares what people think of his work, and has a genuine love for movies.|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on watching this movie DON'T! I warn you... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically horrifying, not in the Horror movie kind of way, to watch. I mistook this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I had noticed I made a mistake I decided to watch this one anyway. I wish I wouldn't have. This movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent.|1
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or sad. They will then go into the song alone. Some people have their song sung until they meet someone and find out they have all the components they need. Some people sing until they encounter someone and discover that they are alone and that the world has abandoned them, leaving them with no one to cry to or tell their own stories of heartache. They will then sing their tears out until their song is ended and the soul with the sorrow is finally released.|0
I could n't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a bit long but it was definitely worth the trouble. The film has some really well shot and edited scenes but I personally think it was slightly too long. The entire film seemed very long in some of the scenes and the action scenes in particular seemed rushed. However, in my opinion this film is a decent one and it could very well be an entry level film for fans. For the most part, The Last Airbender feels a bit repetitive with the various battles and battles against the snake people.|0
Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there ` s no real hard core sex in the game. The sex is just something you can get if you hit the correct button. It may be more than just a sex, but that's the best you'll get in this game. This is a very cool game. It has some cool graphics. The controls are very well designed. This game has lots of cool stuff but the most amazing part of this game is how well the sex work.|0
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon . The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines' voice. He has been on my radar for a long time, but never saw it until I saw the trailer and then it was too late, the trailer was so bad, the movie was not even close. It has some funny parts, but not enough . I think this movie would be more funny if it had a little more acting, and less voice work, and a little more plot . But the trailer is the best thing, it really makes you wait until the end.|0
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui.|1
"... the last time I laughed this much . It 's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he still has the capability of laughing, when it matters the most."" ""I don't even know where you were."" ""You know, you've got a rather unusual set of grandparents. I was talking to my mum this morning. We had a very funny chat about all the time we spend with Grandad. We had a few laughs. He was a good listener. I think you'll find that in him, a great listener."""|0
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. It's very cool and entertaining.There's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie I've seen.|1
In short this movie was awful.I understand it 's a Disney movie , which are generally shallow movies with mediocre characters. I am surprised it took that long for a director and a writing team to complete something so basic in story. I'm not sure if you can call it a movie or not, as it lacks a climax or an end, although it definitely ends in a way that could be called a climax. It feels like the story takes a back-track to the beginning, but if you think about it, its pretty much in the middle of what the story is about.|0
Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M . It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously .... Scott is still alive but the movie is slow moving. I was shocked at how the movie ended and how long it went for. It was suspenseful for a long time and the characters had depth in their personalities. There is still much to be learned by the next two films that are coming out. This one was very well made and I would watch it again as soon as I could. I hope that the next two years are as good as they were here.|0
"I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I was hoping it would end.It had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and Years) together in ""Separate"" beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. He does kiss her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible about it. Very little substance to grab your interest. The acting just does not hold up. He is very passive."|1
The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges . The story is told through the eyes of Stan Laurel, the hero/heroine/saviour of the film. It is also a great look at how a family can be broken and rebuild their life. When you are the “father’s keeper” there will always be things that have to be done and he will always try his best to do his duty as best as he can. That is exactly what Stan did and that is what we should all do.|0
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids , this movie centers around some freak named ""Rudy"" (Drew Barrymore ) who comes back to town and finds himself the owner of a rundown bar in the middle of nowhere . The bar is run by Rudy , an old buddy of Mike's father who was also the owner years before , and it is filled with his kind of customers, and there is the usual mix of alcohol, cigarettes and pot. The bar owner is an alcoholic and is constantly getting into trouble , but Rudy does a good job of keeping things under control ."|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help.|1
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. I don’t like his theory at all because it makes God and the world too “small” for Him to exist and the universe too much for His existence. It makes God too small for us to understand He is all that is and we are too small to grasp His existence. I also believe God exists but we have to accept His existence as we cannot explain all we know as we are unable to see Him and we can’t comprehend Him.|0
This movie was pointless . I ca n't even call it sci-fi , since that requires more from a movie . I don't really mind if it's in the category of fantasy or not . I mean , it has some good lines that I didn't get until it was over ( I think there were at least 3 I didn't get until the end) . I guess you could call it a drama , but it doesn't really have that feel . I think it's pretty good and I'm going to see it again .|0
This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie . Remake a classic film shot-by-shot . I hope nobody makes a remake of King Kong or The Terminator. If you do, you should just give up and go home. If you don't , then I suggest you find a new genre of entertainment. There is only one reason why this idea is a stupid idea: you have no idea what you are doing because you are too scared of making a remake. You have not been watching films in over two decades. You have not even been reading about the original film.|0
This movie , which I just discovered at the video store , has apparently sit around for a couple of months, waiting for someone to make a movie based on it ? This is not good for the film industry, not at all ! As it was stated in the trailer , this film has been made by a team in New Zealand . I have seen nothing about them having ever been here , nor have I seen any info on how they created this movie . But , if they have never been here , why should we care ?|0
"There was nothing remotely funny about this movie . It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing that could make this a comedy . It has a great cast with good performances and it has a couple of funny lines but its also a bit boring. The movie has an excellent script and a good storyline that I enjoyed as much as the characters and the comedy. I recommend this movie as one of the best action movies of the year . Plot

The movie begins in a hospital room where an American businessman (Matt Damon) suffers from the sudden onset of paralysis after he falls from a tall building."|0
"The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was... not very good at all.Like others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.I thought the ending was rather unbelievable.By the way guys, about the ""blow torch in space"".Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name ""Oxy-Acetylene torch""). Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.So a ""blow torch"" would work just fine in space."|1
Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA , which is a beautiful town where I grew up, this was also filmed at Lake Placid. We went to Rockport the day before the movie was shot and were told that the lake was about to be drained and that there were no ice skaters and we could only hope to see one in the end. So we spent the day with the cast and crew of the movie in Rockport and took a walk around the lake that was being drained.|0
The idea behind Dead Silence is great : zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show . But the show itself was not really bad . It was well presented . I didn't know how many zombie movies were made before, but there were many . So Dead Silence was not that great . But it wasn't a bad movie . It was a zombie movie , so I think it had a good chance of winning . I like horror movies , because they can scare you . Dead Silence is a zombie film , because it was a very scary film .|0
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can't figure out which is worst; Norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.Visually the film does nothing for me.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of Best Actor nomination. His only win was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. He actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross.|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act!|1
"It 's a shame . There 's an interesting idea here , but it gets completely lost in a confusion of detail

This is an interesting point but I do not think that it makes the most sense. You know what's a shame here? This is a pretty cool idea and I'd love to see some more research done on this. It would make for a better article though. You know what's a shame? A lot of people don't realize that you don't actually get to see much of the movie. The first thing you see as you go out into the public is the movie."|0
THE OTHER is a supposed `` horror '' movie made during the 1970s . It is not to be confused with the movie of the same title . I found this link on the interwebs. If you can get this movie in your DVD player, it is very good. It may be the best horror movie ever made. I am glad I have this. It is just a movie. In fact I was going to recommend this movie to my wife. But then I realized I have a better recommendation to give her. It is a horror movie that tells the truth.|0
But I ca n't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung . Where to begin . . . First of all it reminds me of my parents house, when I was growing up. I think back, what was the point of all the stuff on the table, so that we would eat at our leisure? Why were we even in the house? Was there no fun in being out of the house? Why were we in that house at all? I used to think I was the center of the universe.|0
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious . The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who has just been diagnosed with a major malformation of his left arm and he has no clue what is going on or why he is not doing well. Well he starts researching the disease that he has to learn a lot of things about and he comes across a great idea for a new surgery that would turn his entire life around. That surgery is going to have a big impact on his life and everyone in it’s path. He is the guy that comes back for the surgery.|0
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not ""relevant"", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely ""A Good Thing"" as Martha Stewart(appropriately)would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this film and Dennis Morgan perfectly compliments her. Both of them have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z."|1
"You know sometimes you just gotta have it? That's how this movie is with me. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but I find myself reaching for it when I'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, I am just not a ""goofy movie"" kinda guy.You can read the synopsis so I don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like Kelsey Grammer you will probably like this movie.One more thing, be SURE to watch the end credits."|1
"The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French ""Emmanuelle 2."" This amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan/Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character, Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality."|1
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink ( ! ) , but KvC ai has just the thing ! After being dumped on her birthday by her husband, KvC is shocked to find that she has to find out how she has been cheated on for years before she can confront the man who has broken her heart. As she digs deeper, she discovers she is a clone of the woman who has broken her heart…and now she must find the person responsible before she breaks down and weeps in front of the camera.|0
"To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I 've ever viewed . So annoyed I even complained to my ISP and they told me it doesn't go through any filter . It doesn't even have an MPAA certificate on the website so I have no reason to believe it is genuine . But I am going to give it a go now so far so good

It is only on the front page it says ""The film was produced in the United Kingdom with the help of UK and U.S. investors and production companies, and financed by American investors."""|0
"Well, after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theatre expecting something big. Boy was I disappointed. First of all, the characterizations in the film are SO weird! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgarly shot ""Maaja Maaja""?"|1
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS . Although he is quite grown up , it is an adventure story for those under the age of 13 . The plot is quite simple. In one day you will be sent off for training at a school , but then you will find that training is very difficult . You won’t really know what to do though . There’s only one other place you could go , so there you will be taught by the same teacher . Then you will have to get back home with some of your friends .|0
This must be the most boring film I ever saw. The only positive I can say about it is that thankfully I didn't pay to see it. We were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film. The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting.|1
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I've only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste.|1
Audrey , I know you truly cherish your husband Ted 's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed the advice of others, I believe this is an opportunity to honor Ted. I don't understand why, in light of what has transpired in the last 24 hours, this is not the time for this post. However, I do feel it's the opprtunity to give a quick history of his life, in case you want to know a few of the more remarkable aspects. So here it is, Ted's bio.|0
This movie sucks so bad . Its funny to see what a poor story this has , where two pea-brained characters play a part in every scene. If I was in the theatre I would be laughing out loud in my seat! I don't want to see this movie but the trailer makes me wanna see it just to watch the actors act like they are stupid! They can be so mean and arrogant at times. I'm going to wait for a new DVD release to see this movie in a theater, or on DVD.|0
Well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. If that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.If, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with HUGE cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so hard I nearly cried.|1
When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry . It completely blew in my opinion of the whole movie. I do not think it did well at all . It was very predictable and boring , not a single scene stood out for me in anyway . Nothing really caught my attention. This movie has always been my favorite movie . I love every part of the movie . I enjoyed every second of it. It was a film that made me happy. It's been a year since my first time watching this movie and I still can not figure out why I always cry at the end .|0
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed, but can’t bring a smile to a man’s face. It’s a familiar role, as it’s played so well in the last few decades by a range of actresses from Jessica Lange, Patricia Arquette to Joaquin Phoenix. But, it’s never been a role that’s had a greater impact on a generation, with many actors and actresses working in it being so well loved.|0
I 'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie . Even my 4 and 6 year old sons said they liked this movie . I think the first movie was a little too slow, but it was very well made. One of my favorite scenes was when we find out the name of the town where we are going, and the people we have to kill. This was actually the first movie I actually watched with my 3 year old. I would recommend this to any kid, even if he or she is only a 3 or 4 year old.|0
I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a Bruce movie for you watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear.|1
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit . How darethey ? It 's not even 10minutes old. It 's not even the same year.But they are doing this to a film which they consider a masterpiece. So you can 't stop them.And this is the point when we say they are not acting. They are just acting. It's not like they're making a movie or anything.The film is based on a true incident and a story which happens every year in our village. They don't have any reason to be acting.They don't want to be acting.|0

I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this `` film '' . This is not just a comedy . There is something in this movie that has a deeper meaning. I am very hopeful for it . I do not see anything that makes me feel sad. But there is something about this story and I believe that it can have an important impact . I love this movie .

Oh Gawd . I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front room, but I can't get anyone over there. Is this even possible? And how could I do it? I have an idea, but it'll have to wait until we're there. I'll do it. I'll put an ad in the newspaper and see if anyone will come out and say they've seen me or that I'm there.

First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie . I was intrigued and curious to learn about it. I watched the first Underworld (2009) and was really impressed by it. Now the second one will be even more interesting . So I am waiting impatiently . There are a lot of similarities and I am wondering if the first one was like this one or not. First off , I must say that I don't know about that first Underworld film . I think I might be wrong . I don't think I am, but who knows .|0
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple . Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper , or Bobby Heenan . It took less than a decade for this to change . Now wrestlers have to know a few tricks, a few things, and to understand who they are competing against . If you don't have a working knowledge of wrestling and how wrestling works . You will be lost . If you don't watch live , then there are some videos you will be able to watch , although I won't go into details . All I want to do is show you the basics.|0
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so I'll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit.|1
In watching this off and on for a few seasons , two things come to mind : One - wondering what the point is - and two - thinking, “if the point was to be seen then why are they watching it” or “why is it being watched at all?”. Now I am not an avid watcher and I did not want to write this piece because it’s been said and I am sure it will get many comments on how this article was a waste of time or not worth reading, however this article is still worth writing as I feel it helps a lot of people.|0
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It kind of careens into 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be Pacino's protégé'. So he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. Does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think of.|1
"One of the reviewers here wrote : `` Good acting , good special effects , greatlocation . Even better ending. I can't find the movie online anywhere but that's where it came from

If there is an error somewhere I'll fix it and add a new review. If no errors, I'll put it here. I don't own it. I didn't pay for that. I really liked it! I didn't expect anything out of the ordinary on the opening scene, but after a few minutes I couldn't help myself."|0
I just watched The Dresser this evening , having only seen it once before , about a dozen years ago.It is absolutely stunning, the costumes are amazing and the acting superb. The film, however is a little heavy on the visual effects.It is far more subtle in execution than it was in 1987, with a few exceptions. The story is a little hard to follow but it is so engrossing that I wanted to share it with my own daughter. It is a well thought out and beautifully constructed movie . The acting is excellent, the story well crafted and the story is very well told.|0
First of all, I personally adore Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in Russia when I was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. Then I heard nothing about Mr Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it is certainly not a good coming back! Why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul?|1
i watched it because my friend said we could try it , when my father asked if we 'd watch it. He said we couldnt because we didnt know what to say. I didnt want my friends to be like my parents. I would hate to be the friend to have to ask my father what i should or should not be saying to my friends. Im going to try and watch this again later this week when my family comes over. im going to try and watch it in a room where i dont have to worry about being judged if we dont watch it.|0
"Yep , it 's me again ! Mr ' I sit through crap so you do n't have to'.What do you want ? ""What are you doing here? I don't see you at school ! "" "" I'm going home soon ! I 've got a lot of work to do ! "" "" Then go to your home and come back ! You 're wasting your time in the city with me ! "" You can take your friend and go to your home ! !I have work too . You can go to the city and wait for my return , I have not seen you here at all !"|0
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi,based of his biography `Wired' , wrote by Bob Woodward.All of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of John Belushi we see one angel accompany Belushi during few points of his life.Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of Belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.The director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused.|1
Well well , at last a view of this underrated flick . But you ca n't find a good copy of the film here on the Net . The only thing we know about it that it is an Indian film and it was directed by Rajnikant Mehra and produced by Shailendra Prasad . It is also a good film and the story is very interesting. The only problem we are having is that the film has been banned by the censors . But we don't know about it , so I guess we can't say whether it is good or not .|0
OK , I read the director 's comment about this movie ( featured as the 'frontmost comment ' ) ,and I thought I should let you know that it does not mean the movie's a total failure. In fact, I really hope this movie has an impact on you . And it is my wish that it does, and that your thoughts on it are of the same quality as my own. I do think it is an enjoyable movie. However, it is not for everyone. I recommend you to view the film before making your own opinion on it .|0
This movie is bad , so bad that my mother who can barely stand the `` suspense '' of Disney movies , called it `` The Last Dragon . '' I thought it was okay . I think the ending was better , and I really enjoyed the musical numbers . Of all the movies that Disney has made this year, it is the one that I haven't seen , because I haven't had money to go see it , and it is not on Netflix. But, I will have to give it a try when it is available for rent , if I get around to that part.|0
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash, some knowledge of movie making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors, and a lot of determination, yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free. Thankfully, I found it in a discount bin somewhere.|1
Sorry about that . But if you have seen this `` epic '' , you will obviously know of the many things I have done in the world to get it done . I am just so proud of the things we achieved . But the things that I want to do in the next one ! I can see that there is a gap in the game and if I get a chance to take it on a bigger level . It will be a great challenge . My aim is to be one of the best , and if we can do so , it is the most important thing in life !|0
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today!|1
Honestly , on the subject of the death penalty , I could take it or leave it . The problem for me isn't the execution , it's the crime. I think that the death penalty is an important deterrent and I think that it's the only option to keep violent criminals from murdering other violent criminals. But I also think that there are limits to that power . I think that there are situations where it is justified to kill a convicted criminal. I'm not sure that there is one situation that is so rare that it could never be used to kill a convicted criminal.|0
This is a very low budget film , set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of an artificial snowfall. I don't mind if it's a film from my own childhood. I really enjoyed it. I was not expecting a lot out of this one. A lot of the acting was fantastic (and the acting is very realistic). The sound was great, the camera work well done, it was all about the story, not about the actors or the sets or anything like that, all the details of the film came together beautifully.|0
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I 've ever seen . Very little of Segal , himself, was used. This was a movie that was made from the ground up. Segal and his family were the actors , not the story . I'm glad I was given a chance to see it but I wasn't so thrilled with how the film looked . This movie is very different from most of the Segal movies . The Segal that appeared in this movie is very young , young at heart , but very serious and focused.|0
"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp."|1
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people.|1
A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People begin to wonder if they did it. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. The cops speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to trial. They are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented.|1
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just because it's an adaptation of a book and that I just can't stand. I can barely stand anything about the book. It doesn't matter if it's adapted or not. There are certain things in the book that I hate that the film does well and certain things that don't. This review contains spoilers. So I watched the film last night while watching a movie, and like I've said before the thing that really bothers me is the dialogue.|0
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. There never is the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years of age. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie.|1
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning . Well I was drawn to the fact that I was unable to find any of these items in the store. This is the one I saw in the article, I don't know what I'm gonna do with it, and I don't want to sell it because I can't find it anymore. I'm gonna have to let it sit for a long time before I can move it, then it won't fit in the store. This one is probably the most unique of the lot.|0
"First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never ""big"" here in the US as it is everywhere else.That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen.Now, I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over and this show stands out.The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was terrific."|1
Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets better with time. So what is Yahoo Serious? First of all, it's Yahoo. This is not an internet website. This is a real person. It is Yahoo's site and they have it all. Every single post has a name and a title. Every single link is a link to the real Yahoo Serious. It is real, it is not a mock up that you will find here.|0
"I cannot believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage! The acting was so poor, my Grandmother could have done better. The punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the Scarecrow was knocking to the floor. The movie became a chore to watch! So this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing, even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences. So, naturally, they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called ""Scarecrow."""|1
"Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite ""up-to-par"" sex scenes. That's right another great softcore parody! I enjoyed this film greatly! Sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. But it's like the great god of softcore smut Russ Meyers said ""who really cares what goes down beneath the waist."""|1
This movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. All the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes I ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. At least I was entertained. The ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I didn't care to remember. And what was with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. And where the heck did that guy (John Corbett's character) come from?|1
Not really all that much to this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a great deal of influence over how you drive, and this film was no different (except that we didn’t see them actually driving around). The first thing I noticed as the movie progressed was the way the racers went on their runs in the morning. As the movie goes, the racers are at the finish in a race car, but I’m sure they were also at the finish line in a real stock car.|0
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across.|1
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on . It brings back happy times for me . I grow up and it’s a good story . I’m sure it will be good for younger viewers to follow. I’d recommend it to everyone. There are lots of ways to watch it on Netflix . The story takes place after the events of Lost in Space and takes place 30 years before the first film. I watched it twice . I’m sure this version of the film will be a lot better. I think the original version had some pretty good scenes.|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube . For a low-budget effort , it has all the ingredients for being a horror film, and then some . It's the second in an occasional trilogy of movies that have taken the genre to such new places , and with this third entry , they are getting a bit closer to the core elements that will keep the audience going for a decade or two . The first two movies were very different , and with the third , they are a little closer to that core .|0
"This one and the one prior ""Toulon's Revenge"" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series."|1
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it.I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film. I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other movies. It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie, but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it.This films is Truly Exceptional!|1
Yeah , what did I expect ? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point. The film starts off with a boy’s journey of life in America and how he meets his girlfriend. Then it switches gears to the story about the girl’s family and her struggle. The film is about the way a woman with a high level of intelligence (which she had to conceal from her family, because she was being watched by an evil scientist) would have been able to hide from a man who is a pedophile.|0
"Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good ! ! ! Thought it was a bit too long with too many plot twists and so on... but I can see how some of you can't wait to see the next movie... I guess I can see why...

Now if you're one of those people who doesn't have any patience, you might be wondering how it is that we still can see all of the parts of a movie we haven't watched? Well, this might have something to tell you..."|0
`` Nicodemus '' is almost a copy of `` Red '' in the odd behavior sense , but this episode is much better for the characters as well as for the story arc. At the end of season 3 there is a great cliffhanger and it's a very good episode for it. As the end of season 3, it is a great way to end season 3. And it will be a great episode for the rest of Season 3. The episode starts with a big fight scene. The fight is very good in the first three minutes.|0
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director 's new film The Hunger. And I think it is because the first two times I saw this, I wanted to throw the movie back into a trash can because, to me at least, it had so much potential. I'm not sure why I did this but I wanted this one to be different than the other three zombie movies I've seen over the last two years, but I couldn't seem to figure out how and the only way was to watch it and hope I'd figure it out.|0
There are so many holes in the plot , it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience. One thing that has become clear is that this book was written by someone who had no idea how to write good fiction. I’ve never been able to find a copy of this book in the library or anywhere else that I could see. I haven’t done my research on who did this work, what the title was, what the plot of this story was like before this work of theirs was published, etc. etc.|0
Ok , everybody agreed on what was the best season . The first . And killing off Boone was a major mistake. But the team didn’t quit. The team stayed together. Now the team is trying to move on and find the right balance. There have been a few issues with guys, and I think the main reason why they won a title last year was because of what happened at the end. That team had some problems, but overall I believe they can win championships . The biggest question is the health of Boone.|0
Y'know, it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...Anyways, it's been a long time since I've watched anything Muppet related, but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character.|1
This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced.|1
Some describe CALIGULIA as `` the '' most controversial film of its era . While this is debatable , it is easy to appreciate CALIGULIA as a stylistic triumph. This is because of how it is played off of the visual effects. CALIGULIA, also known as THE CLOCK TOWER, is an action thriller set in a clock tower in England. There is a plot centered on a clock tower in London that begins with a clock malfunction and an assassination attempt. When a terrorist is shot dead, the tower is brought under attack and the clock tower is destroyed.|0
"I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster. It is officially the only movie that I've wanted to undo watching. Let me start off by saying that I like ""B"" Movies. I consider ""Ice Pirates"" One of the best comedies EVER. I'll also note that I'm a writer and that I've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.Evaluating the acting: If I was going to pick a bright spot I'd have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this."|1
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more similarly to this, there's Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie's a D-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it.|1
"Honestly, I don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. It embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. The storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit ""Fast"", that is a good thing.Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easily as good as Tom Baker.Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela.I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus."|1
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home.|1
Buyer beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description. The movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. It looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception.|1
`` Witchery '' is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn ! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one, and he makes the movie a fun ride that is a bit light on the thrills, so take your time, and see if you don't enjoy it. I think this is worth your money for sure ! (If you haven't seen the movie, and don't think it's worthwhile, here's a good review.) If I was to suggest a sequel, I'd say one of the best horror movies of the late 1970s.|0
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).|1
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like ""Pistolero"", ""Comanche"" and ""The Gent"" I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while ""CC Rider"" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable."|1
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young . Instead , I found the first installment in a series in which the Grammy-nominated singer interviews people he admires. At first, the documentary looks like some kind of historical document of Neil Young’s life and career. And then I thought to myself — I’m not going to do that; I’m only going to watch what I’m going to be told about by him. And then it happened — I’ll never forget it.|0
But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there isn't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims.|1
I finally watched the third film in Mehta 's trilogy : `` Fire '' . To begin , I 'd love the first film but after reading the first two I 'm not too sure about this film . So , this is a film which has a great story , but it also has some flaws . But after watching the third film , I 'm happy with it . I 've seen all the three films . First of all , how do you get the money to shoot the film ? The movie takes place in India , but I do not think there is an Indian film making company in India .|0
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict . The movie is one of the great documentaries on drugs in general. It is fascinating and very informative. You will not want to miss the next one. If you like movies of this nature, I highly recommend you to take a look at it. Ridiculous! A movie which was created by some crackhead, and is being made by his friends to make him money for drugs. They do it because it is fun to see them making money and they do it to make them feel good in a pathetic way.|0
"Seriously I don't get why people are all like ""Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!!!"" It's a bunch of junk! The acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. The music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well."|1
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.I often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics.|1
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms ( actually only three or four so far). They are all about three guys in their twenties living together, going out together and not really having sex, so why not? They usually make fun of other people who are not in a relationship and they make fun of sex. Usually they use sex as humor. Most of them are so bad that people just laugh and forget about what they did in the name of entertainment.|0
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen on film, and I've viewed thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it.|1
UP AT THE VILLA ( 2000 ) * * 1/2WARNING : YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt 's hard to know what to think. There is so much I have read in the past year, I don 't even know what to say. I have been disappointed so many times, but I do want to thank the writers and the director for giving me so much enjoyment in the film. The ending is so different from how I had expected and I hope it is well done. I am very happy with how I am liking it.|0
I thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. Well I was totally wrong. There's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood film. They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? This is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.I thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original.|1
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point : the little Vasque town of Obaba . It is also a place where we have to be careful because its inhabitants are dangerous. This story is part of a three parts series about Obabakoak and it will be released in May. I’ve had a lot of fun reading this book but I still think it needs a lot of polish before it can be a solid book. The only thing I’d like to see in it is a little bit more about the main character.|0
This film is absolutely appalling and awful . It 's not low budget , it 's a no budget film . It 's not about making a ' good film ', it 's not even a ' good film ' . This is the worst movie that I 've ever seen in my whole life . My eyes are watering , it is not funny ,it is not good , not even a good laugh . It 's not even about a joke , it 's just a ' joke ' . Its like it was written by the devil , not God , it has a terrible plot .|0
Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . He could effortlessly switch from comedy to drama with ease, yet he was able to take on so many roles, as he would prove in the next ten years on screen. He is known to have won seven Emmy’s and a record five Tony’s, but he had the opportunity to make the leap from Hollywood to Broadway to Broadway to Broadway and back again for a total of more than 70 performances. Lemoine was born in Los Angeles, California on May 11, 1924.|0
The most amazing film I have ever seen . I did n't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the blog. I am in awe. It is an amazing film . If I was not so busy and I wanted to see a movie, I would go check it out . Not just any movie but a masterpiece that is worth seeing . Thanks for making this movie . It is amazing ! I watched it at my friend's house. I'm not sure whether he was a fan or not, but his reaction to this movie was one of awe and respect.|0
I really love this movie . It has a very real feel to it . I believe it was never made for TV . It's a wonderful story with some of my favorite movie characters . I hope this movie will make it to theaters and maybe it will be part of the new Universal library . I hope everyone who is watching it will see what a beautiful piece of art this movie is . I will try to post this review once every week . I will post it in my Facebook page . There is just one problem . I cannot find it .|0
"When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(Richard Johnson of ""Zombi 2"" fame),a mad scientist(Joseph Cotten),his beautiful daughter(Barbara Bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.The tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.And though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."|1
Absolutely the most thoughtful , spiritually deep , intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close . Jacobi is more than just a Shakespearean ham . . . In this version of Hamlet, there are very few things that might surprise us. It is a story where Shakespeare is more than just a writer, and where there are very few elements that are new . . . Shakespeare plays a very prominent role. There are several key scenes where Hamlet has to do the job that he has been assigned, yet he does it his way. This Hamlet is not a traditional Hamlet.|0
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh 's head , which is always hidden from public view. I did not hear about it, even though I know this idea has been used before. So why this time? Why do you think it should be so important? It does not make sense in the current times, I'm sure you've heard of the latest news and you think you have a better idea. That is not what I meant. I mean a good idea. Not necessarily a brilliant one. One that can do something.|0
"Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever. This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons."|1
`` Hood Rat '' is absolutely terrible . This is a urban version of `` Willard '' . I just hope that it will be as good as the original , as it is a really good movie , and will probably get good ratings . Hood Rat looks like it could be the worst horror movie ever . I am really disappointed , because I would love this film to be great . Hood Rat is a total waste of time . If they make an animated movie , it should not be a bad version of the movie .|0
I decided to watch this movie because I 'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie . I 'm so sorry that I've already missed the first movie, I've been too busy with my life .I 'll definetly return and watch it now. I 'm not too sure about the second movie, because I 've heard so many bad things that 're just not true . I would like to see this movie, because the acting and the acting was amazing in this movie, and it has a good story, and a good message that I like.|0
"I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever ! He gave us the awesome ""Avengers: Infinity War"". I am sure Marvel Studios is doing everything they can to keep him busy but I am hoping that one of the next Avengers movies can be the one to make Black a household name among all the action movies fans. He has a great screen presence that I can’t believe was left out of every movie ever made. He has a unique style that makes him seem like a mix of Robert DeNiro and Samuel L Jackson."|0
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all . After all , this was a very well done and well researched special. One thing i am glad about is that it was not an ad that was going to make the audience to buy an item. It really just showed the life of the people who were involved in this and how they lived. It really just showed a life and how the life went on. I have enjoyed watching this show, it made my heart warm.|0
"Man , I never laugh so much this year , and it 's pretty hard to make me laugh . :o )

In fact , it's pretty hard to make me laugh , no not in general , but in one specific situation . So , just to give you guys a little background ,

I came back home after my summer vacation and was a bit surprised at how much fun I had , I had so many friends , and I was so happy to return home . But , I was also a bit overwhelmed ."|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced . That is their main justification to keep giving me hate for watching it. It doesn't look balanced. The main character in the movie appears in the movie and he doesn't seem like a nice person. Some of his traits are very negative and some of the things that are shown are just ridiculous. Just because I disagree with the people who are criticizing this movie doesn't make me a bad person, I have every right to do so and it is my right to not like it and to not watch it.|0
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.|1
I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! He gave us the awesome (at it's time)Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to super stardom. Then followed that up with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and Thrills.|1
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. Davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St.|1
"Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams "" Depalma , DePalma , Depalma ""Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own ."|1
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!)|1
I 've seen all 3 now . I just ca n't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is . Not in comparison to what it was like before it started. I know they are in the top 10 but i just wonder how much worse they are now ? Is this why the qtsi are so much worse than they were before the start of the niqoyqatsi war ? I guess i am missing something. I've heard it is worse, even worse now than it used to be. I wonder how it would be if we started the war again and they started the war .|0
Sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film.|1
I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera.|1
"What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and was a master of satire. ""The most striking thing about Caravaggio, to me, is the way he is able to bring life to his canvas,"" writes French art historian Gilles Pons. ""The most striking thing about this artist was his ability to get the attention of the world and his ability to make us look. His art was not meant to please the viewer but to please himself. He did not want to please anyone but himself."|0
As I write this in November 2005 I've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results Romantic comedies .|1
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. There are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? Not at all, is my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with a failure like this.|1
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the U.S. and couldn't work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe.|1
This is an astonishingly bad action film . I 'd say its primary flaw is that it 's BORING . Its secondary faults are its poor plot , bad acting and boring story . The rest of it is great . Not just because it 's a great B-movie ( it really is) , but because this is a good film . I hope this review does it no good , but just give it a look as well . I have no idea why I haven 't seen it yet , it is in my queue . So I hope that you are all having a nice day and enjoying the movie .|0
I do n't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy , and maybe I will in the near future . But I decided to give this one a try because . . . it is one of my guilty pleasures. I've watched the first season of the show a couple of times . I'm not going to lie , I usually go for the second and third season . However I've decided to give this one another try and . . . it is one of the most entertaining and funny comedies I've seen in awhile .|0
"The recent documentary ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart,Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. If he hadn't been under contract to Warner Bros. he would've of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator."|1
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. The film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. But there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. The film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going.|1
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''A good Movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''.|1
An obvious cash-in on the * Insert Monster Here * On A Plane gimmick , Flight Of The Living Dead is not a horror movie in the sense of it is not based in reality , and is not about real-world horror. But it does deal in themes of survival in a very real-life situation (or at least the aftermath) . What is the story ? The story involves a group of friends who decide to go on a road-trip to celebrate a friend who passed away. They decide to go by train instead of taking the plane as the road-trippers do .|0
"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that."|1
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today. Many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. From the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand.|1
This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall . It is hard to compare such badness with the original. I have always enjoyed the story. The story in this movie is very much like a horror movie except with an evil clown. The clown comes in and makes everyone around him sick. His only intention is to kill the people that are around the clown and the people he likes. When it starts to get real bad I thought this was going to be a very fun movie but it is so very bad. All of his evil plans are in the beginning.|0
"From the beginning of this film , with it 's `` The Lost boys '' rip off opening sequence , and even with "" The Lost Boys '' main storyline , there has been a series of changes that have made this film more than any of the others. These changes include, but are not limited to the following: The plot is a little longer than the other films in the trilogy . Also, the film's plot is somewhat more complex. The film's overall plot is also slightly more complex than all the movies in the series."|0
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards).|1
Not really worth a review , but I suppose it 's my duty to warn you all - especially since we are now in the process of moving to a new apartment and it seems that it is going to be a very quiet night. I'm going to write a short story in a couple of days with the intention of doing a Q&A at a later date. So please don't expect me to review anything in the mean time. I've already had to write the story that I was working on when we moved away, so I don't need any help with it now.|0
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.This movie's story line was onion skin thin.|1
"My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: ""If I were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I couldn't imagine Hell being any worse. Jim Varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). Now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a Varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. Not a laugh. Not one."|1
Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, Emma, and daughter, Annie.Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly.But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons.|1
This film could have been great- but wasn't. Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one stripped off. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish.|1
"The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's ""Nine Lives"" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect."|1
"At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp , the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough guy' to beat the bullies in the first game of the season."" ""You know, I can't believe I'm saying that right now, but I know you have to have courage, to be courageous to do what you need to do to win."" ""I want you to remember, we are the last line of defense and we must look out for each other because sometimes the bullies can be the bully in disguise."""|0
Now I 'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so that is what I am going to be watching. I'm interested in the story but not in the technical side of things, I think this could be just another story about a young boy on his way to his first day at his new school. It's a good intro for me because I've seen a few of the movies and I liked them for a little while but not enough to want to go out and watch any more of them.|0
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love came up after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). People!!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie. A film film. So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...Modern Love. Hmmmm.|1
Take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. So sorry. I really tried to like it.|1
Closet Land is an amazing , terrifying piece of cinema . It features only two actors in a single set of 3 scenes . There are 3 sets of characters , each one with its own story , and its own character . The first set of scenes are all very quick , but then the story takes off and the 2nd and the 3rd set of scenes make up the film . This film is a great , great film . Its not a great , great film , its just a really really really really really great film , with great special effects , great visuals , and very good acting .|0
"I was surprised to like this movie since I'm from the ""check your brain at the door and have fun"" school of film viewing. However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like unsocialized Evie. And I've been in Evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with Evie were raw and painful to watch."|1
"If you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy ""special"" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! Not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. The special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie."|1
This movie is not worth anything . I mean , if you want to watch this kind of stuff , then you have to pay for the popcorn . But , this movie is awesome !!!!!! I can watch it a million time !!!! Ok , let's make it easier for people who don't like the first movie !!!! I won't say any more , because no one can understand me , but , this time , I'm talking about the next movie , after the first movie .|0
Why would anyone make a film like this? Why would anybody invest in a film like this? Why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? Why would any theatre show a film like this? Why would any TV channel program a film like this? Why would any critic bother to review a film like this? Why would anybody watch a film like this? Why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. This is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible.|1
MR . BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes . Written and filmed as a `` light , sports comedy '' in the style of Buster Keaton's comedies ( and Buster Keaton, the most famous baseball player in America is the father of Jackie Robinson , the greatest baseball player in American history. But it's more than a comedy ; it's a story about the most famous American sports hero of them all . . . . . The story is the story about baseball in America. ) The story is about the rise of baseball in the USA .|0
Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie , which took me three sessions over three days to read. I don't think I have read any of this in all the years of reading. It is well worth it if you are in the mood for the kind of movie that would be appropriate to see at a movie house. It is worth seeing at home, though I doubt the same amount of money would buy it in a theater. This one is no longer on the shelves of my local book store.|0
This is a joke, right? This can't be a real film? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. The film maker's can't be serious... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama gone horribly wrong? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. The dialogue isn't clichéd.|1
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie ! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch with the family or with your friends. The only bad thing I can say about the movie is its slow pace. I can't really say that its a great movie but it was still fun to watch and it is well worth the wait. The only thing that makes the movie worth the time it takes to watch is the cast and all the great moments they had.|0
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life.|1
"I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto . the movie is fast paced with good action scenes . it has great effects . This movie is great for Naruto fans . Rating:

8/10(9.6/10)8.5/10

If you don’t know about this movie or have never seen this movie . you will never know this movie or how great it is . it is a must see movie . if you liked Naruto the Movie or any other Naruto movies you will also love this. This is my first review of this movie ."|0
Norm ( an ) ally I do n't mind remakes . There are some pretty good ones out there , but they're mostly out of date . But in this particular case I felt like I had a better idea of the story than before . This particular book was actually based on one of the novels I liked best . It has a lot of similarities with it , but it does a good job of telling the story of what happened . In some ways , it takes place more than a year after the events in the movie . The book is also much more graphic .|0
Dreadful. I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. I just finished watching the film, BTW.I love good cross genre films. This isn't one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, I'll watch them all. But you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.I love philosophical films. This isn't one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately.|1
It 's painfully obvious that the people who made this `` movie '' have never seen such brilliant spoofs as '' A Christmas Tale'' and ' ''The Nightmare Before Christmas ','' ''The Incredibles'' and ''Fantastic Mr. Fox''.'' And yet they thought they could do that here. Why, after all, do they put so much effort into trying to replicate the original and then have to come up with so bad an imitation, as if the people in the film really didn't know how the original had turned out?|0
I can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much. Well, I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan. While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man!|1
Yeah , I know my title sucks . I could n't think of any other title . x ] Ice and Snow . I had to change my title a little . I had a hard time finding good titles . I decided to have a go .

Thanks for reading . ]|0
It ` s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read on a credit score . It will read as . You have credit and you need a new credit rating and they will ask you why you need a credit . So how can you have credit that you can't really pay off. So that's when your instinct is to look at your credit. And it will ask you about how you were treated by the credit bureaus . and how much you owe them. And then your credit score will be affected.|0
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on IMDb, I'll leave this comment here.Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film.|1
There 's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima ( Meiko Kaji ) , Female Scorpion , and a group of her classmates at the end of the film. But this is not about Nami , or the film it is about. It is a new type of action film, one where the main character is not a hero. This time around the main character, Kaji , goes on a journey , taking along a few other classmates as well as the teacher , and the film itself. And that's the problem with this film.|0
Bad , bad , and did I mention bad ? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the story was how in the end all the monsters were gone and the building was once again safe for all to see. I love that this book has such a nice balance of action and storytelling. It was a great story to tell, and the illustrations in the book add so much detail to the world and characters of the book that it is truly a pleasure to read. There is so many twists to the story that I can only imagine what will happen after the book is finished.|0
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."""|1
I mean , nothing happens , 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... and they fall in love with marijuana . It's all a bit surreal. So I don't think we should be too surprised if they make a film, because they'll probably try to do it again. I'd expect that to be in the next three years, with two of the films having been in development for quite a bit longer. I have faith that they'll figure it out, because the first film was such a huge success that it will have to be.|0
"I'm a big horror film buff, particularly of the 1980's subgenres. Name one  I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called ""Saw"" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet...those just looked terrible!) I saw the film on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life."|1
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. I'd love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.I am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated.|1
"Like Margot in ""Fear of Fear"" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in ""Fox and his friends"" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in ""The Stationsmaster's Wife"" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German ""Wirtschaftswunder""-Society after World War II in R.W."|1
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day at all, since it's a far cry from the highly polished look of the films released over the last few decades. And if you ever find yourself in one of the cinemas in London in the summer of 2019, you can just imagine the horror that awaits you. So why do I continue to enjoy this film? For me it's a combination of its unique look and the wonderful cast that makes it a delight for the eyes.|0
From the makers of Underworld , we have , by far , the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen, and it is not even at the top of the list. Let me set the record straight. So why did I even bother watching this thing? Why did I watch the movie anyway? Well, I don't want to spoil it so I'm not going to give away anything. So let me tell you all my thoughts about the movie, my expectations and my dislikes. I hope to give everyone a fair idea of what I thought, and what I felt after watching the movie.|0
`` Cat In The Brain '' is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels like it was ripped from a movie. ''It'' doesn't really work as a movie. It's just one of the best things you could ever see. There's a kind of goth-ness to the film, and I'm not sure that's a bad thing, but it does feel a little derivative of other films, so it's probably not something that's gonna be a big hit at the box office.|0
It 's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film . Three main female deities -- wise and powerful, but also sexy and seductive -- are played by Bollywood screen legends. But it's the romantic interplay of the male deities with their respective female counterparts that really steals the show. And while the movie does a great job of portraying Hinduism in a real-world setting, and while there is an obvious reference to real-world religious rituals, it never gets bogged down by it. In fact, it all works quite well on a very human level.|0
"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, ""Camp Bloody awful""), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... Awful acting-check. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. It doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable."|1
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? I ca nnt think of a few, but I will definitely be looking at this. I loved it so much. As for my other question, I do know the author. I know the actor and director. I did not know the writer. If you know any good ones I would like to see. I saw this film in a theater and enjoyed it. I liked how it was shot. And the characters were original.|0
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its characters. The plot is as one-sided, predictable, and one-sided as it can possibly be. You may even have the feeling that it was made to be re-used in other movies. The plot of this movie is so poor, so weak, that it fails to live up to the hype, but it does live up to the hype and the hype alone. The plot is so weak that this movie deserves to become the worst film in history.|0
This movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and hearing, and I didn't believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match.|1
In Sweet Water, the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as Bone Eater and their bones are devoured by the monster. The half-breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressed by Krantz to arrest the protesters.|1
This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of `` Next Generation '' and `` Voyager'' and all the episodes of the `` X-files''. I even rewatched the first season of the `` Lost'' series.I know that some episodes have a higher quality then others. For example the episode `` The Eye '' has one of the best quality shows ever. It is a great example of the quality of shows. But the quality of this episode is lower. The writing is weak and weak. The acting is poor.|0
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson . Ms. Merkerson is a young lady who has all the natural gifts that you would expect of a model, yet she possesses some of the most stunning features you would expect from a beautiful girl of the 21st century. She is beautiful and graceful, and her skin has the color and consistency that you would expect from someone with that kind of pigment in her hair and her skin. In fact, she has a very pale color in her blonde hair, and a dark color on her face.|0
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie . I came across this and rented it. I couldn’t decide if I wanted to buy or rent. The film was a documentary and was a lot of fun to view. The film was about a man’s story of losing his family in a car accident. He was a good looking guy. When I was done watching this movie, I felt like I really understood how that happened. The accident that was going on in that car, the story of a man who loses his family.|0
"This is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, ""Watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick. "".What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many that can pull it off like Bob Hoskins but he isn't in this one."|1
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone ` s home movie . Drama schools must have it easy , with the students getting a free movie at the beginning of classes. I wonder if they will even let the kids know what to expect. And then there is the question of what is ' good enough ' and what is ' too good to be true '. Well, if they can do it in a commercial theatre , it is a great thing. But if they have to do it in a private school like ours , well then it's not so wonderful.|0
A bit `` the movie in the movie '' case , or as the theme is virtual game here , in which the game play is similar to the traditional case , you can find this type of game in the game genre , in which you have to play a virtual game in a virtual world or virtual reality , which is a virtual world or virtual reality . There are some interesting games which you have to play in these virtual world or virtual reality . Here I have described the types of games in this virtual world or virtual reality .|0
"Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at ""film noir"". The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The ""non-traditional"" casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder ""what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?"" then the storyteller has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish."|1
His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace.|1
I 've read the positive comments on this movie . I assume people who were in this movie must 've had a great time on the shoot . I was not too dissapointed . I saw the trailer of the film and I got really excited . It looks really good . I have to agree with one poster 's comment that there is too much action . It seemed like the movie did not go slow enough to please me . The story lines and the characters are very well written . I also liked that there were several scenes in this movie that could have been better .|0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak , it 's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a TV show came in 1986, when a few writers and a cast of writers met at NBC Studios in case they could come up with a project. The plan was to air the show as an anthology on the Fox Network in late 1987. Well, a few months down the line they got a phone call to say they were not doing an anthology, so we did a pilot in 1985. We did five episodes of that, but they never aired.|0
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. Besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters.|1
'Do n't Look In the Basement ' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is very good at keeping his players on the edge of the world. And that's just the reality. In fact, it's a great place to get away from the outside world for the first time. This is a good club and a great footballing place. And we want to stay there. The fans have spoken and we will do the very best to keep them. We will do all that we can to support them.|0
There were only two redeeming features about this movie; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget about the plot or storyline from the book - they're completely absent from this movie. In fact, about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. If the film makers had made a good movie, even though unrelated to the book, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not.|1
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager . I grew up with the Sesame Street movies, which was one of the reasons for watching it. I am a big fan of the show and of the books. This is probably my favorite Sesame Street movie, but you can't really argue with the success of the other movies. My friend has a copy of this and said he doesn't want to watch the TV show anymore because he likes the books as well. So if you are in the same boat I would recommend it.|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston , Texas . I really enjoyed this movie because I didn't think I would like it as much as I did , although I didn't think the story line was very well constructed . Well , it turned out that I LOVED this movie . My parents didn't really know what to think but I told my little brother about it so he could understand it better . I think the main reason I enjoyed this movie was because of the characters that were involved . I loved that there was more to the story line than the main characters .|0
"This is one of a rarity of movies , where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it. For those who are looking for more, here is the synopsis :

“You have to be a genius to get into the world of space, but an average person to be a pilot. So what do we have here? You’ve heard the story, we have the evidence, but what are the odds of us getting a crack at this one? It’ll be the most amazing, mind-blowing experience ever!”

I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time ."|0
