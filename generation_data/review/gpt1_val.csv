this twisted comedy is well acted and directed . very funny and the production quality is outstanding . it is a classic , yet the play has the potential to be hilarious . i do n't think i should try to edit it . i have always liked the style , but it made me feel sick when i first saw it in the film . the scene is completely messed up and i am trying to enjoy it while it still works . also , i could n't agree with you more if i had watched it all on dvd . i hope you enjoyed it .|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
i love this movie . and disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . i think they should do something else . you never can tell what will happen in this movie . it all just keeps piling higher and higher . i ca n't believe how many of these people are having a very hard time reading the book . i really hate that we have to live with such an atrocious film . no matter what happens during the movie , it still remains a terrible thing to watch . but then again , sometimes it gets pretty bad . i would like to avoid this movie if at all possible .|0
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
( my synopsis ) rae ( christina ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie rabanne for a long time . the plot is about to change and ronnie has to do his best to get into bed with her before he becomes a sexual deviant . if this does n't work then maybe it would not be too horrible if it did work . i liked the ending of the movie , so here goes . as we are sitting at one of those tables , i think i heard some laughter in the main dining room , so i asked ronnie how it was going .|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
"when this film gets it right it really gets it right . and when it goes wrong . . . i ' d just have to die , you know . . . there ' s not much room in that movie . "" "" then why didn ' t you ? "" said don ' t bother . 
 "" how should i know ? i was only supposed to get two hours of my life until the sequel . "" "" what are you talking about ? you got five minutes . you ' ll have plenty of time to save the rest if you ' re willing to do what they think best ."|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
after i ' ve seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this series . what do you think about these guys ? the film is one of the most horrible films i have ever seen , and i ca n't really blame them in its way . but i know that there must have been some major differences between the two scenes for the actors to be so hostile to this film . no matter where we try to put a good story together we always run out of lines . this movie ( which is just as bad as the movies ) has too many flaws .|0
the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen . to explain my experience , let me say that this movie is a little off base . it is more like a video on the internet , but at least it does not reveal about any of the characters . the overall premise is very odd , as if it had no clue what was going on behind the scenes . i could just imagine what the script said , but there is no telling what else could be said . the cast and crew were all dressed up in formal attire and they were all acting funny .|0
this movie is very long , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . it has an all - star cast and is about as good as they come . i think i will have one hell of a blast watching this film . after the show , i will take some of my friends out for drinks afterwards to relax and enjoy their time together . hopefully i will be able to make it to the club in time to give them a good night 's sleep . there was no need to wait around for dinner .|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
i watched this film in a singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 february , 2006 ) and came away with a lot more than i had thought . the plot was bad , all right , but the movie was good enough . so it was n't a total waste to watch it on dvd , which is a relief because the characters were boring as hell . also , there is a very good sense of humour when it comes to comedy movies . how about you ? what was your first impression of this movie ? i hope you liked it .|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old . i knew nothing about how this film had been released , except for the fact that there was one scene in it where an army officer is walking a soldier across a field of dead bodies with a rifle strapped to his back . i never understood why they wanted soldiers to do this . it made me think that the military were trying to make some sort of joke on them or something . what kind of joke was that ? they were doing this as a joke , right ?|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band ' s 30 year career . lee , however , does his best to be a gentleman and shows off all his skills in an attempt to impress people . i was n't really paying attention but then again it was a long shot anyway . i only saw half of the music and the audience , so i do n't see much more than that . after the first thirty minutes of the show i lost my interest . i decided to head for the bar to get another round of beers .|0
maybe it ' s just a personal affection for this screen version of the mika waltari novel , or a fondness for her new movie , although i don ' t know what kind of love it might be . it ' s a little boring , but it is interesting to see how much people could really love each other . i hope you enjoy this novel and are looking forward to watching it on every dvd . if not , i will go back and visit my father . he doesn ' t approve of this genre .|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"so we saw this on dvd at our apartment here in paris . we ' re all here on an exchange student program . i hope you enjoy it . there will be a lot of pictures of people and some of them are not very nice . "" the screen flashed to a small video clip of a large man dressed like he has been doing drugs with drugs . he walks around the campus trying to figure out who his accomplices are . as he walks down a long road that runs parallel to the main road leading to the hotel , another person is walking along it ."|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
once again elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . bugs of daffy . he ' s unsure how to get around the situation so that he will not have to resort to any other method of revenge . he ' s been on his own most of these months , and has little hope of escaping this horrible reality . but i think you are missing the main point at which it all started . first of all , this is an american movie . it was a popular one before the war . then , when it came time for the invasion of america , the president began acting as president in 1936 .|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
forget about donnie darko . i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have written are based on the idea of an old sitcom where somebody is getting killed by a gangster . i know that you can not imagine what it must have felt like to watch a murder movie , but in this movie they make a lot of jokes about the gangsters and how they are supposed to go to jail or get their heads handed to them . i have to admit , i am quite happy watching this documentary .|0
i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . i really ca n ' t come up with a good story in the first place . no , i do not wish to waste any more time on this . i just must write this movie and keep writing until i get what i want . if it takes a lifetime , i swear i will buy it . i am a big fan by nature . but i need to work on something else . there are too many characters to make this much sense .|0
mcboing boing is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to start being an actor for a few more days . this movie would most likely never get made , at least i 'm sure it does n't . there is some sort of comedy / comedy festival going on just south of here in new york ( or maybe somewhere in north america where the film did not show even a flicker ) but the ending is very bad . it gets worse with every day . how do you turn off the movie ?|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
i absolutely adored this movie as a child and still do as an adult . to say that is even more unbelievable than just being in the movie , it should be noted that no one else really likes this movie either . how could anyone love this movie ? what kind of actors are these people ? why am i so bored with them ? i can not wait for the second episode to start ! this was one of those things that must have been hard to watch at all . although i loved this film , i was n't much interested in watching any other parts of the movie .|0
not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission , i can only look at this as a way of telling you to go to hell . but i suppose it was n't really such a bad idea . in fact , one of the first things i learned in this book was that if you leave people in the dust , you have a hard life . i had always wondered what it would be like to live a whole life , but since i could not write an article or get any work done , i found myself reading all sorts of fiction .|0
bluff i really think this movie is very good . is basic a different kind of colombian movie . is hilarious and funny . how do people get along in that world ? if it was n't for poor quality , there are plenty of nice characters to be found on tv . however , if the movie was more interesting than any of the other movies , you might want to take a look at this one . let 's not forget the fact we had two guys who got killed by a man who wanted to kill his friend .|0
okay , where to begin . did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous and famous people in an effort to put them at ease ? i do n't mean to belittle your work , it just is . there are so few of them in the whole wide world , this production was quite well done , but it is still a poor imitation of a production . no matter what movie you choose to view this one will certainly be better than most of the movies we have seen before . let me tell you something !|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
i ' m astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of this book at all . there were only four of them out of five , including a couple that had probably never seen any movie . i am also pleased to say that most of the characters in this series are just plain dumb . no surprise there . some of the most popular comedies or comedies that have ever been made up is based on the plot line but what makes it so good is that the plot is flawed .|0
"every time i hear karen carpenter ' s voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 ' s blues . when she was little i would go to the zoo and watch them for a few weeks . it seemed so funny . then i remember how they had this big fight over what movie they saw . "" you know you should really watch something like that , "" thomas said . "" it is one of the stupidest films i have ever seen . anyway , the director wants me to be the star in this movie , which i do not care much for ."|0
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
i absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : i am from romania and have been to many places around europe , but not for very long . i have never been to new york and i really thought it was the worst place to go . as a small boy i would imagine paris to be all kinds of nice , even if there was so much crap on the streets that your eyes could no longer see the difference between the two extremes . here is the first thing i saw when i walked through the door .|0
i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule and there was a lot of crap on the dvd , so i spent a lot of time trying to decide what i was looking at . i thought this film was kind of cute and totally not the worst film ever . when you do get to watch it you just can not help being impressed . it is such a waste of my time . in fact , it is nothing like any other bad movie i have ever seen . there are many films that should never have existed .|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
honestly . . this show warms my heart , i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new movie is rolling , i can finally move forward . i am feeling better after the movie , i have never felt so alive before in my life . what a rush to see this ! ! ! i ca n't wait to get home and sit down with the girls . they were so funny and they listened to all of my jokes like they were special to us . we are still having a great time and i want to thank you all for your help today .|0
see no evil with kane . the movie has a great storyline but it just was n ' t a hide my feelings . we all want to be heroes that can protect our loved ones from demons , zombies and other paranormal activity . the movie reminds us of the movies at home . this film really is too bad about so much bad stuff going on in this country . as far as i know there are no real villains or monsters . the book is totally boring ( which means i have seen a lot of horrible movies for a long time ) .|0
i saw it in europe - plex . great movie ! ! this film is an exploration of the spirit and the essence of cinema , but i can only compare it to that of any of the movies that were put together in 1987 . first off , there is a big difference between the films produced in theaters and what i thought of as the real thing . the reality shows on screen were very bad , so i decided to let them all play out . the main reason why they make the movies is because they do n't actually live in theaters .|0
i ' ve seen ' nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival ' films by the sea ' , but had no clue as to why . i think that it was because there was such a shortage of people for this show . i thought it must have come from a book or something , but i do not know exactly where it came from . at least , i don ' t want to . i am much more interested in what is happening now than in the rest of the cast and crew .|0
almost 20 years before frank marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ` ` alive ' ' , there is no better film than that one . i was in a trance from the story until the end , and by that point , i must say that i am not familiar with any of these characters . all i wanted to do was to watch the movie . unfortunately , i have no idea how to turn this into something even remotely exciting . first off , i would have liked to see the rest of the movie .|0
"yes , this is one of the better done television movies and i would n ' t expect less from joe sargent . "" it 's great ! i can watch this movie for 2 hours a week , which is what i normally do on sundays . not this time though - this movie starts with a woman being interviewed by her husband saying , "" she does n't seem like a very nice person in the way she is dressed . i wonder why he thinks she should stay married to him . after all , she had made no move to leave the country since she found out about the pregnancy .

"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
i ca n ' t help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . to be honest , i saw my fair share of scenes where the producers were in a snit . this one , however , is worse than any other movie i have ever seen . it was so hot and heavy that it left me drooling and feeling like i just took a shot in the face . i mean , how many people would have even heard of the film if it had not been for the movies themselves ? as an adult , i 've seen films like these countless times .|0
"this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be an awesome movie . he goes to visit his brother who happens to be a producer who works in a production company . he gets so excited when he sees the film that he does n't know what to think , like if someone has shown up with a camera , or if someone was filming for the film . the movie is about a young actress who has just been taken on a "" romantic adventure "" - the same girl who did not show up for the movie ."|0
` 5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , but this is really a comedy of errors ; it ' s only the actors and the audience seem to enjoy it as much as we can . the rest of the movie has a similar theme - people who go to africa and try to live off the land . i thought that there wouldn ' t be anything in it that was funny . this is something out of a horror movie from the early 20th century .|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist.

Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
i do n ' t usually like to see movies while they ' re still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i have a good idea of why . when i saw the movie , i was just really interested and then i saw this very bad movie with some horrible people in it so i hadn ' t any intention of watching them at all . you know , i don ' t mind the film but i don ' t think i ' m willing to watch that movie again . not unless it is going to end up in a horror film .|0
a remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much , much younger than i really wanted to experience in this film ! i would not have been able to understand how it got out about this movie , and even if i can , i ca n't imagine what my life as an actor should be compared to . i did like the movie . i am a big fan of the american gothic genre . i mean they are all great movies , but i also enjoyed seeing them so badly .|0
i could n ' t believe the eye candy from start to finish . being a fan of movies directed by music lovers , i did my part to please them , even if i wasn ' t good enough to make this one for real - and it ' s very funny that i should say this because i had just spent most of the movie thinking that i was going to have to wait another three years before i saw some of these things . as i sat in front of the full length screen , i couldn ' t help but watch the whole movie .|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . this is what today ' s documentaries are all about . it ' s more of an example of a young girl who has never learned how to make a movie with her family in the background . here , there ' s no one for me to compare them to , or at least not much that i can recall . let ' s leave this part out , and see if anyone else wanted to pick a movie . i do not remember my childhood being any better , so i think maybe i ' d be interested in watching this rather than listening to it .|0
i have n ' t seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way that it could have easily killed me . i had a very good childhood , but nothing of the sort compared to the life i lived . i was born and raised in florida as a child . this is a wonderful story about my mom and dad . for some reason they are able to live together without trying to make them more miserable . their relationship with the people around them is extremely loving . you can not understand how important this is to them or what its value is to me .|0
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
alright so this episode makes fun of al gore . i ' m sure it pisses a few liberals off . the one time i was on my way there , i went to an italian restaurant and saw a very funny looking guy at the window . i decided to come in anyway . the guy asked me if i knew how to cook a good spaghetti sauce , so i told him i did , but i was hoping he might want to try some first before we get out of here . he said maybe later that night i could help with dinner . no thanks !|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
` ` the honkers ' ' is probably slim pickens best performance of all time . when we were shooting , everyone seemed to be a little more involved in their lives . it makes me feel that there may be another kind of music in this one . you know i do n't really like classic rock , but let me tell you what i think it will look like on tv if you watch it for 10 minutes . this movie was actually very good . the opening scene was great and had an overall quality that i just thought would be worth watching . but it was not .|0
recently i saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . in the original there is a scene in which the heroine gets pregnant and goes away with a man from out of state who kills himself by stabbing his father . no doubt , this movie would have had some good moments if it were n't for what just happened . i think it 's a good movie that makes people laugh . most of the bad ones are probably funny . not to mention the plot itself has been bad . i can see myself falling in love with this movie but i will not let it ruin my weekend .|0
' the cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and i mean this literally . the story is full of horror and violence and yet there is such a bright light in his eyes . on the way home , he tells me how he was forced to watch this video for the first time after his parents died . he went to live with his parents at the age of twenty one . he spent most of his school days in that house , which made me wonder what they could possibly see in him . i wondered if it would have been better if he had just stopped acting out .|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
along with virtually every republic picture ever made , ` ` murder in the music hall ' ' seems to have undeservably been the theme here -- i believe that one has already been put away as a bad idea . it could have come from any number of popular television programs , but this was not so . and why should it ? what makes a tv film interesting is the role of characters in it , and the fact that all of the actors seemed to act as though they were on stage at all times . it just does n't add up .|0
i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie . my teen - agers enjoyed it over the last few years as they saw more action in their lives than at any other time . i think that all of the films on television , especially when they get to see an adult movie about children , were very well done . one is not disappointed with the first two , but there is no hope for the third . after reading this film i found myself wondering whether the director actually intended to keep the plot alive or if he just put together the movie to create something even more bizarre .|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
i have just seen a very original film that i would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the poor . ' you see , while it is an incredible work of art , there are some things that do not actually look well at all . here is one of them : a young woman and she is looking for a good man who can help her . the first movie that i saw was quite a bit different than the other films ; in the first two , it was about this boy and the woman who had gotten married after being separated for ten years .|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
north and south is a miniseries from the ` ` golden age ' ' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which was called the ' golden age ' for some people . there are about 20 % of that film made with any sort of dialogue to guide us in the role of actors . i believe those who like to make jokes about it think they know how to be a comedian , and this movie has an entirely different set of characters . it makes no sense at all - but it does take away one 's sense of humor .|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
"pat conroy ' s autobiographical book ` ` the water is wide ' ' proves to be something of a southern ` ` up and down ' in terms of history , but it really did sound like some kind of sci - fi film . for years , i had watched all kinds of films that i would not have imagined myself being able to watch by myself . my favourite one was "" an island with giant waves ' and it was quite entertaining . i got along very well with don ' t get angry because i was trying to keep my balance on the sand ."|0
"one of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . to have it over with , but not having to do that - which i did - i just wanted to take a quick picture and go back to sleep . by the way , there are too many characters here to even know whether or not it has been an original action movie . so , instead of paying attention to what the plot says , rather than letting my mind wander , i took a short detour and spent the entire evening trying to convince myself that this "" movie "" actually went on for real ."|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little - known reality : that of the student council in the 1920s . but as they get older , this film loses its appeal . rather than be seen as some sort of hilarious comedy , it is a tragedy to watch . one of the worst films i have ever seen ( aside from those episodes when i was still a kid ) has been shown in an early 1990s dvd by an extremely young actress who just happened to be at a concert .|0
"i ' m seen this documentary in its feature - form , in a movie theatre . and . . . wouah ! the pictures are so horrible that my first thought isn ' t really good . the director is very cute ( who ' s going to see it ? he ' s a little too skinny ) , but then i find out about his infidelity . . . . chapter 4 
 i just got home from shopping . i was looking forward to the weekend ; i had planned to watch one of those horror movies that make you want to be sick ."|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
i too saw this movie when it first came out . i was a teenager at the time , and i had an inkling that something bad was going to happen . so i took a few minutes to watch it with some friends of mine . the story was rather funny but i liked the way the plot went . i loved every second of the part and was very impressed with the portrayal . while the character did not appear to be able to act properly in real life , it is obvious that his mind was set on some kind of special action .|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
this film was made soon enough after karen ' s passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen ' s age would have found a lot of comfort in the movie . not that i am a fan or anything like that . if you ' re interested , let me share what i saw when i was looking at this movie . it is about a young woman being led through a dark woods by men she ' s been attracted to . she is terrified and has no idea where she is going . she falls head first into a tree and lies there for a long time feeling sorry for herself .|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
this film was both entertaining and thought - provoking . i ' d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and listen in on what is going on behind the scenes so that they will enjoy it better . i think it ' s best if you all just go ahead and watch this movie , and do your own part . as a group , most of you probably don ' t know the difference between good films and bad ones ? i ' ve read plenty of those , but i would say that the main characters are fairly boring .|0
this game is very good for the n64 . you can skate as tony hawk , bob burnquist , steve mclaurin , stephen king , and any of the rest of you who ever wrote an oscar - worthy comedy . it was a long time ago when i tried to make a living on one of their old shows , but it seems like forever ago . let 's go through this film again and try to find something that will be familiar . ok ? after the first episode we went back to my car and started looking through some of the dvd channels .|0
wow ! an amazing , lost piece of australiana and a lost 70s glam - rock film rolled into one . this film has made a great deal of progress in my opinion , but is still being considered by some critics for their original plot . there is nothing i would have liked better than to have taken the time to re - write it . however , i also wanted to wait until it was finished . i am not sure where i would have found the budget for this movie , and even if i did i do not know where to look .|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
"i just watched this movie on it ' s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . i liked ( but did not like ) the sound of that . i found myself wondering where it had been when it was first made , what happened to it ? i have never heard anything about it being so bad . it makes no sense ! well i think i got some good vibes from the show , but there was one point where i started asking questions about it . "" what do you do for fun ? "" i would say in hopes of finding out more , and maybe get some answers as well ."|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . in many ways , you can say that the film was much more entertaining than the movies it produced . not only did the acting and the dialogue appear to be mediocre , but the script was completely off - beat . there were a number of minor errors , but nothing that really made any sense . it was obvious from the way the scenes were written that the producers were intentionally trying to make it look like a success rather than an failure . the characters seemed to know what they were doing .|0
the hurried approach that lewis seiler takes with king of the underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining one of the greatest historical romance novels in history . this was not just an attempt to get publicity , however . it truly is the biggest production ever seen on the earth , and you ca n't make it back out of there without spending a great deal of money . if you do n't buy this book , or any other copy , you 're going to end up paying a huge amount of money for something you will never see coming .|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
i love this show ! it is amazing . . . i can never miss an episode even if i ' ve already seen a few episodes . there is no way that i will let you put this movie to waste , especially in my professional opinion . this show has been designed to promote the story of what happened in iraq . we just have to watch it from a certain point and figure out exactly how it came about . it ' s very hard to explain . here are a few things i really want you to know about your new role .|0
this is how i interpreted the movie : first things first . there was not a single scene in the movie that had an opening scene , but i could tell that it was some sort of plot as it was written and the main characters always seemed to be in the worst situations . i do n't recall any real dialogue for the film , just a series of random twists and turns . i guess i should have been happy that this was a movie , but it was just too much of a farce . i can not imagine my parents ever making a movie based on this .|0
central airport is the story of a pilot named jim ( richard barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in the past two years while in the air by himself . he had an accident with a car which left him stranded and unable to continue his rescue , and as it turns out this was the only mishap that ever made him able to avoid being killed on board . during the three years i worked for him , i came across some very weird stories involving other pilots and their wives . some were really amusing , including the one about a man trying to kill a plane .|0
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
"it has been recorded that john ford made the ` ` big , blockbuster ' ' movies so that he could afford to spend money on them . "" i watched this movie a few weeks ago , as i was working at my computer . it was funny in a predictable way ; i was really enjoying being an actor . i was hoping that one of the actresses or actors would find this movie funny . but no such luck ; it was too bad . i found myself trying to watch this movie a couple of times , only to be informed by a group of girls who wanted their friends back ."|0
as a european , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 ' s . on the other hand , it was a fairly easy film to start with . and there were very few moments that i would not have missed had i spent more time working on my first book . some of those moments were great . they gave me a good excuse to avoid writing for a while after i got home from the university . unfortunately , i did not have enough material to put all this together .|0
* * spoilers ahead * * it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch an ugly piece of garbage . i thought you might want to hear this at least once . maybe the film was n't as bad as some of the critics think . i mean there were still plenty of moments that were just a bit better than this one . i do remember that one scene where people are being murdered by the japanese . i could not decide which was worse , the japanese killing all those people or the japanese being butchered in front of them .|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
i ' ll be brief : i normally hate films like this venomously . . . but there is just something about this one , which makes it special . as a movie director you can easily imagine all kinds of movies that would not make it worth viewing , especially in this particular film . but i didn ' t mind watching this one . i had a really good time when i watched it . i liked the way it portrayed the protagonists , how they looked and acted . so what was wrong with this one ? i love movies made in theaters .|0
"comeundone , i love you ! i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this episode . "" we both looked over to where the movie was playing and saw a young man with blond hair walking out onto the porch . he had on a light blue sports coat and black shorts that made him look like he just stepped off the cover of gq magazine . after taking a deep breath , i decided to go for it . "" hey , what 's your name ? "" he turned to face me . "" who are you ? """|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
robin hood ; men in tights is worth watching , i recently watched it because i ' ve just become a fan of the movie ( for a fact ! ) . it is a horror film with a good cover but very boring . how could anyone like this movie even think to watch it if they were so stupid as to not see it when they were first allowed to watch it ? the only thing that got me interested was the fact that the screenplay does n't have a title which seemed to give them some indication of whether it would be good or bad for the actors .|0
i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the last of the footage . the scene before us was similar to mine , except with fewer actors and a certain amount of dialogue . but as you know , my character is not very imaginative . he has little in common with our protagonist and spends most of his time trying to make her understand what he really wants to do . they end up falling for one another pretty quickly , and when they get bored together , he starts acting like a typical hollywood actor .|0
"watching the wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great ford films , like ' i just got a bad break with this movie ' . "" as i recall , when we first made the documentary , our film became pretty predictable and did not make much sense . if you want to see a good movie it has nothing to do with being an actor , except that most of the dialogue was so awful and the scenes so poor that you could not believe the characters were acting at all ."|0
this movie was so cool ! i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends . i just sat there watching , not sure what to say . as soon as the first few scenes were shown , i felt sorry for the young boy who had been captured and tortured in that movie . now he would probably spend his whole life locked up in a hospital . no wonder he was sent to the camp . if i was an innocent bystander , i guess i would n't have gone along with the movie . i am certainly not .|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
"fata morgana is an absolute masterpiece . it ' s werner herzog ' s most unconventional film . it does n ' t have any of the elements that you would expect and some of the plays don ' t seem to be anything else at all . this is really a great film , but not one i could ever have made . "" he sat down in the chair beside me , and i immediately tried to hide my disgust with how bad it was on the screen . the movie didn ' t even make any sense . i had never seen it before ."|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
it ' s hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick - on the one hand , i can ' t believe that you are watching this crap ! but on the other hand , it doesn ' t give me a good feeling . when i saw this in the movie , i just wanted to be sure that all the characters did what they were supposed to , and that was it . it was like someone got a kick out of not knowing whether or not to use a knife . there were so many details that i could have used to describe these films , but i do not .|0
i saw chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . it is a delightfully cute film , with an excellent sense of humor . if you had looked at it in more detail , you might be able to see that they all went to great pains to make this one go . unfortunately , none of them made it ; the title simply did not fit the script . i watched the movie on hbo every day for eight years . i thought it was going to be like old times . however , i could not even watch it since i had been out of school for 6 hours .|0
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"there are a few things in life that we ca n ' t experience more than once and the college experience is just not one of them , "" i replied . "" after all , when you look at it from a different angle , you see a lot of old movie trailers , but this movie was made by a really well - known american film producer . "" i thought this was the first time i had seen this movie as if it was an episode of tv . i was hoping to find something interesting to compare it with and some new plot or story to occupy me while i was still here ."|0
"i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . it was a fun romp with some cool guys . they made me feel more alive than in my life . that was before i got the tattoo . but , after watching this movie , i could see what you must think of as being "" romantic . "" not only is it beautiful , it has a great acting ability and a fantastic plot . there is also an excellent quality to the act . i think this is because it is one of those films where all characters ( or actors ) look like they are going through some kind of transition ."|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
"the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : ' the gunfighter ' by henry king , and ' wagon train . "" i watched him sit back down and continue to write while i sipped a cup of coffee . i did n't really enjoy what i was doing , and i was beginning to wonder just how much trouble i had gotten into . when i finished with the movie , i looked around to see if there was any one who could help me out . most of the other students were already asleep , so i decided not to go to their dorm room yet ."|0
"guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some poor guy was having and they decided to try this one . after a few more minutes i thought about going into the store for a glass of water , but i figured i might as well stay in the house while i waited . it must have been very cold on that rainy afternoon when we got there . "" "" what happened to the rest of the movie ? "" i asked . 
 "" ok , here 's an excerpt of a great movie by don williams ."|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . i can not tell you how badly that movie was taken ! i mean it is all such a waste of good money . my brother has never heard of anything like this and i am very embarrassed to hear that there are so many different films out there which would be more effective if they did have something in common with these movies . what kind of person would do such a thing ? one who spends his whole life watching the world around him , only to see his son die from a mysterious disease .|0
"i must say it was a let down . overall its great to see the way aparna sen has handled the crisis , if it was ever going to happen . at this time in history there is very little that really gives you the impression we have any real hope of stopping the civil war , but there are some things that make sure that it will . "" "" what 's your point ? "" michael asked . 
 "" you do not know the reason for our people being defeated by these aliens ? they have killed everyone who came within a hundred feet of them and their own people !"|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . this movie jumped from crime drama to action flick into something that i would describe as the best of movies . the only thing we have n't seen yet is a thriller . we can watch it in one of my favorites , but at the end , you ca n't really make much sense of what you saw . if you wanted to know how it ends , just click on the link to see the sequel , which should be available within a year . please check out these videos and do not bother taking the same route over and over again .|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
i ' m not the biggest fan of westerns . my two personal favorites though are unforgiven , and tombstone . they don ' t even have that in their movies anymore . there was a time when the civil war was the worst thing that ever happened , but you can ' t really blame anyone for not having much fun . some of the most important characters in these stories come from all over america . anyway , the movie is too boring to be funny . it ' s almost like a video game with a big screen and nothing else to look forward to .|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
when i was engaged , my fiance and i would frequent the adult bookstores . he would look for his wife and if she was out of town at all , he would send his wife home to visit her children who lived in a small town close by . the story is similar to what most people will have expected from a child . after a couple of days , the young boy starts talking about an old man who had once worked in the movie theater . this must have been a very busy night because nobody paid any attention to the movie except for the actors who were always so quiet .|0
first of all - i ' m not one to go all sappy over movies . i saw friends in the film with a different person every friday night after work , so that ' s what i see . this movie was actually more fun than i would have chosen to watch if it ' s not for my sister ' s ridiculous acting and bad acting . i guess you could say we ' ve had a great few years together , but she is constantly trying to break my heart when she tries to get me to do something for her , and i just hadn ' t been on stage for a few years .|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
hmm , is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and mark - paul gosselaar ' s post saved by the bell acting ? i thought this film was based on a movie . no , it ' s not . but then when i ' ve been looking at this movie for five years i ' d like to know if it has any similarities . there is none . i ' ve seen so many movies in my time , though they didn ' t have the talent for this one . i would have given it to someone else , but i ' m just really bored .|0
15 park avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in new jersey . for some reason this movie seems so wrong , why would anyone do this ? i mean we were trying to be a cool rock star and now it 's just a stupid movie . they seem like great actors , but i guess you have to understand there is nothing to be seen of them except their acting abilities . the scene is quite odd considering how much of what they are doing appears to be part of a comedy .|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
this was on odd film . i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children who do n't actually know how to act . i am not a child however , and i am definitely not a child ! if i ever had any idea how old i am when i first saw this film i would have never believed that this movie was in any way remotely like the original . i just wanted to enjoy this show for two reasons : 1 ) because it looks so great and 2 ) it is pretty funny . you could tell that they were both very well written and performed .|0
it came before ` ` the ten commandments ' ' ` ` land of the pharaohs ' ' ` ` ben hur ' ' and it ' s a bad movie . ' this is a really bad movie . i had to pick it for the third time when i was trying to make something special out of the old days , which was a total waste of my money . now i just have to look forward to this film . but i do hope it ' s not the only one that ' s going to be destroyed . there are always some good comedies about people being murdered by their loved ones .|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
i love this film ( dont know why it is called pot luck in england - what a rubbish , awful movie ) ; it just seems so lame and cheap to watch with a tv screen that does nothing but make you wonder whether there ever was one at all . my opinion : the only reason this film even has an acting career is because they do n't get to watch it on tv . when we go to see this movie , we end up being led by a character from the movies that looks like she has no idea what she is talking about .|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty - one years . as a boy , i was not allowed to watch anything except cartoons with my friends and movies of all different kinds . you see , when i first started viewing these books , i could not fathom why they did so . in fact , i had never seen anything more pathetic or disgusting than this movie : the two young girls sitting on their front porch watching some trashy comedy together . after seeing it on tv ( which was very stupid by the way ) , i decided to just leave it off .|0

The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
at first i could n ' t tell if it was an art film or a documentary . the day after i found the camera , i had no idea what the hell was going on , but in all honesty there were some good - looking women in the pictures . one thing i am sure of , however , is that not even a few of the shots looked real . as far as the film went , the acting was fantastic , the dialogue was funny and the lighting was great . by the time i came back with the rest of the videos , i decided to put them away and go to bed .|0
i saw riverdance - the new show and loved it from the very first moment ! it is an energetic film , but that shows that this movie is not good enough . so what happened ? why do you want something better ? i think it was just a bad line in the book . i did n't read the story of the two young women who were killed in the war . since then i have tried to get more information about the plot . at least they had the good sense to come to the movies for help . i can tell you what they really wanted out of this novel .|0
- it has carla gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - ' ' jaded ' ' is a really good plot line ) . the first movie was written in 1964 , but there is no way of knowing how long it will last . the author did not intend to write about anything that was out of the ordinary in the first person , but the second one was pretty funny . so i think you are right . maybe i am a little biased , but this movie was probably the most boring thing i saw in three years of film .|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer ( exceptionally well - played by veteran character actor richard carle ) being told that he is being watched by a ' woman ' who happens to live in his apartment complex . it takes me a few hours , but i manage to track her down at the theatre . i have been trying for years to find out if she knew anything about this man who was murdered . i went to an internet café and got a good picture of him in the early part of the film .|0
renee zellweger absolutely shines as nurse betty , easily one of the most charming , off - beat , and lighthearted comedies . in fact , i have never seen anything quite like this movie before . when i first watched it several years ago i thought it sounded like a great plot but the premise was just too contrived for my liking . i had no idea there was such a thing . if you did , you could learn a lot by watching these movies . i am sorry that i have to say this is one of the only films that ever made it through any film without making a horrible sound .|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and croft sitcoms , i thought i would get them all done now instead of waiting until tomorrow . if you have not heard this story before , make sure you take as much footage as you can . there may be things about the plot that might be a bit different from what we already know . at least it has been written for the first few minutes . it 's not so bad . after being stuck on this movie long enough to appreciate the quality of its portrayal , my favorite thing in the whole world is watching the movie .|0
this film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 ' s . the script is quite simple and the characters seem completely believable . the acting is atrocious , however the dialogue is pretty straight - forward , and the dialogue is predictable . i really thought it would be a good picture . there was only about 7 minutes between each scene , so that could have easily been more fun than the original , but if you were looking for a movie like these , you will have to wait 10 days or more .|0
i lack cable - vision and no longer have ` ` directv ' ' . so being a rural resident i have to wait until after i go to bed or call my cell phone while i 'm in the shower , because it takes a while for the number of the movie to appear on the screen . this movie was really old - fashioned , and i just sat there trying to process what i was seeing . i thought if that had been the end of it , things might have been more interesting . however , it was actually the start of the last episode .|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1

A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
this film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . this is the true story of one woman and one man . while he may not have any romantic intentions , i think he has a weak spot for her . after all , this is his life and he loves her . at least when he was with her there were some good points . but he had a weakness for her because he could n't get what she wanted to do or why he would want to tell her these things . on top of that , she was constantly making him feel as if he was too much of a player .|0
i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival . i went in with the assumption that it would have some kind of dramatic impact , and it did not . it 's a comedy by the way : the movie is very unoriginal . there are a bunch of actors who will tell you exactly what the script is for , and they all seem pretty harmless . i was able to read a couple of parts of the movie from the beginning , and it seemed to me that these guys were really getting into their roles .|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
having read all of the comments on this film i am still amazed at fox ' s reluctance to release a new movie . it has an extremely realistic quality about it and is a real waste of time . you could see that the production was really bad , especially in the beginning because they wanted to show how many people were involved in this movie . when the cast began to feel like they had committed an act of stupidity , the director suddenly changes his mind - or at least did not want to play by the same rules as before .|0
in the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker ' s mother dies , but he continues making films with his sister and daughter . by the end of this series , it ' s almost time for him to retire from hollywood and get a job in l.a. , which is more than i could have dreamed possible . however , i do have a great appreciation for movies based on how they are performed . i want to add that if you have an aversion to anything that is done at one point in a movie , then you are not alone in feeling uncomfortable in the presence of such awful people .|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"michelle , anicee alvina , was so nice , and i really fall in love with her . she died in the late 1980 's , leaving a note on the kitchen counter that read : "" do something about your wife ! "" it was my first experience at having sex with one of my sister 's friends . i had no idea how this would ever be done but i had never seen porn in my life . the last time i was out with someone , the only things i saw were movies and music . even then i did not watch those movies as much as i watched the ones on the tv ."|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
police officer dirk hendricks ( jamie bartlett ) files an amnesty application alex mpondo ( chiwetel ejiofor ) . a member of the family who has been found guilty of kidnapping and attempted murder during the abduction of his wife and two - year - old son . also available for download is the original horror movie set in london , but i have no time to read it right now . thanks to the characters and their plot , you get the impression that this book was meant for people like myself . when i saw this scene , i thought something was up , but did n't know anything at the time .|0
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
forget about the plot of this movie . forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by vince vaughn . you should see how he tries to act cool and aloof , which is a good thing because he does n't have to do much of that . in the film , it is like being stuck in a horror movie . we ca n't say exactly what makes the actors act , but they make a lot of sense ( maybe ) . however , this movie is completely off - putting . there is only one scene that has been played since i last saw it .|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a lot of people know about it . well , i hope that was ok with my mom . she thought it should have been left up to her daughter to decide which movies or what to get . i think if she would have just listened to me maybe things would be different . after all , who would do such a thing ? then again , you are n't really living in the 80s anymore . anyway , the movie is bad , but it does seem to give you a sense of purpose in life .|0
as a dedicated lover of all things egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 ' s , along with the new series . it is based on the history of the pyramids and the many different theories about what was going on there . it also has some fascinating facts but i ca n't make anything out at this time . i guess this movie should have been done in 1982 . the main thing to notice is that one of the most popular movies in the world came out by itself . i am not quite sure if you see this because i thought you were seeing it for the first time .|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
this one started excellently . the photography and audio are the best i ' ve experienced in years ( okay , maybe a couple years ) . the characters seem to have their own way of moving along with the story but it is n't really the same thing . if you have seen a movie about an african american who comes across as a typical texan he or she has some problems . what happens when he or she gets killed ? do they end up dead from exposure or worse ? so much for not having to work on your screenplay .|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * i found the film amusing . it was weird and i enjoy it more than i should have . i want to laugh at how stupid most people were , but i guess i just got tired of being a comedian . i saw a comedy on cable once when i was in the same room . there was a female who was playing an indian / japanese woman with black hair and white - rimmed glasses ( i can not read the script ) as well as a tall , thin man who seemed like he could pass for asian .|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide . fuckland the title is a pun based on the film ' s lead story , which has been re - created in 1982 , but it still is n't funny . the plot twists and turns at this point ; there seems to be nothing else to look for . i found this very hard to believe . i have never seen so many people take part in one movie just for fun , and though most of those films have been made during the eighties , these were probably the first movies written since the time of prohibition .|0
when i saw the preview for this movie , i figured to myself , ` ` here ' s another dumb tv show that was going to be just as lame . this movie is actually a little more romantic - like than the other one . the characters are all alike in that they behave differently and seem to be better - behaved . but the ending is so stupid . it makes no sense . if there is a problem , you go back to see how things are going to wind down . what kind of character gets murdered in this movie ?|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film . it was when i was a teenager , in the year 2011 . we had just spent two weeks in an apartment in brooklyn with an old friend from school . my mother called and told us to stop by the apartment at 7:30 on friday night . she said there was a reason for her calling me . i did n't know what she meant until i sat down to get ready for dinner . as i looked into the mirror i saw myself staring back at me . i do n't really know why i thought about looking at myself like that .|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film.

i do n ' t think i have ever seen a better movie parody . mel brooks is insane . every time he plays , he tries to tell his wife that he wants her to come on to the stage and sing for him at the wedding . it would be so hilarious . this movie is a total waste of film . you can get a lot of good reviews by reading the reviews and getting them all . i really hate this movie . i never had much of a sense of humor , and there is not much else to write , but in this movie it was bad .|0
i have n ' t seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and i have been looking forward to seeing what it was . the plot is fairly boring , and there is n't much you can do with a good horror flick . my opinion is pretty bad . it does not tell you anything useful about who they are , or how they come into possession of them , or even what exactly these people are up to . it just says that whoever they are , they were working for an evil organization that made all the money .|0

Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all - star high school . they make a great team which makes for an excellent combination of good guys and bad guys . as i say , one of the reasons why i hate high school is that my mother wo nt let me go to a high school . it is not because my father does not care about his son . this is mainly because he thinks the best boy should be doing something different . if he can do something like that , he would at least have the means to do it well .|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film , but what is it ? ! it is not much different than some of the other films . it is a very strange movie . for one thing it is just like any other . i will tell you right now i do not believe in aliens or whatever else you are saying . the only reason i believe in aliens is because they appear to be harmless . however , i am no fool . when the aliens happen to show up on my street i am terrified .|0
do n ' t watch this movie expecting the jane austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . this time i was surprised that anyone had ever been able to create a good film like this . there are too many things we can not understand when we use the computer to see these movies . i have never seen one of these movies and i did not enjoy them much myself . they all seem like something in between . why should i want to see this movie ? because it appears to be an attempt at making someone look good while doing so .|0
in a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , king of queens is more than just good - looking and popular ; he 's the only one i can see making it on any reality television shows . there are n't many people with the ability to create this movie that will give you the feeling they could make this movie . what about these characters ? do we want anyone to make this story a reality ? who are they ? was the plot so bad that they ended up doing something else ? does this guy even have an opinion ?|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
it ' s interesting to watch how late 1950 ' s society is depicted in this film . men are lecherous , they cheat and they do horrible things . all the women of the movie appear to be in an intimate relationship , both physically and emotionally , and some are even on the receiving end of sexual attention from their partners . it ' s obvious that these women have a special attraction to one another , but there is nothing in the film to make them act as if they were in a serious relationship . i know what it was like to experience love for the first time after being divorced for two years .|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
15 park avenue is the address ` ` mithi / mithali ' ' ( konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning at 10 minutes . that gives us about an hour and a half to find this girl . it will take me less than 30 minutes to walk there , so please be patient . if you want my opinion then you do not ask questions of people who are asking questions of you . i was very confused when i first arrived because i thought that she would be around the corner somewhere . however , i had to wait until the sun came up to see if she was really there .|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
this was a pretty good episode . though no ` ` trapped in the closet ' ' or ` ` cartoon wars , ' we all saw that it was a very bad movie , because the story has no plot , no plot at all and there are so many scenes , i had to edit about twenty - five minutes of it . i can not imagine what might have caused such a reaction from the actors . i think they simply enjoyed seeing the characters ' acting skills fail . as a young child i watched a lot of bad flicks , but i never saw much of any of them .|0
neil labute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , in the company of men & your friends . when he finds out what is going on , he puts his life on hold . it is not worth risking his sanity to see this movie . and that is how i came to be here . for many years i have been living in a tiny little town in arizona where most people are just lazy bums with no real interest in being productive . as time went by , i found that there were a few decent opportunities for me to become an investigative reporter .|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"very good ` ` precoder ' ' starring dick barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of hawks . i have seen a few movies - and there is a big difference between a hawk and a cockatoo ; both are extremely well known to their fans . it makes the movie a lot less frightening if one can say that about all the other films . as far as most of the other movies are concerned , the only major character flaws in this film are the first three lines : "" we are going to get our comeuppance "" and "" why not ? """|0
"enjoyable film that gives you romance , women - on - the - verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . "" it 's a good book with lots of historical characters . there is plenty of plot and some sequences for fun . this is an extremely good book , as i was not really into comics , but i am glad to know that it was written in such a good way . i could not have said how many times i saw my father get angry when his son or daughter tried to leave home ."|0
i love this movie ! i know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but i think it would have been better if we had thought of something worse to do with the movie . instead we picked the film because it was more fun than the previous films , so we actually decided on the ' b ' section . the title is just plain bad . when i first saw the film , i wanted to go home and hide under my covers . i mean really , what is wrong with me ? i did not even get the chance to check out this movie until about an hour ago .|0
being an avid carpenter fan , i really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired ) , and i spent several hours watching every single one of the many films that were written . for the first half hour , i thought it was terrible . the movie is bad - but not as bad as the ones you watch in the movies at least . after about 10 minutes , i had to change my mind . i could not get over the fact that it seemed like so many people were dying to see the movie .|0
"i caught this flick on the trail end of a tape i had used to capture a movie i truly enjoyed . "" "" well , that 's pretty much how it started out . there are n't too many things like this in america , except for the fact that you get a lot of people who do n't believe in films and they spend their whole life making movies . the only bad part is that most of them still do , because they have to put up with the constant criticism from the rest of us . i mean really , what could possibly go wrong with some of the things we hear about ?"|0
first of all , ignore the comment about how south park should make fun of republicans . everyone is doing what they 're supposed to be doing , and there 's a lot of negativity that goes into saying what you really think : ' hey , i 'm bored out of my mind with this book ! why does it feel like so many people are fighting over it ? ' we get along pretty well in school , but when i got my own house back , i ended up having to deal with my parents ' divorce .|0
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . i saw this documentary a couple of years back when i thought i would be able to put this together and come up with some pretty good stories . i just wanted to get my head on straight that this film has got to be bad , but i realize now that it does not make any difference how bad it is or what happened to it . i will give you a few minutes to look at this story for yourself .|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! it was funny and all , but at the time i only thought it was supposed to be funny . in reality it was just an imitation of a japanese cartoon . i think there were some pretty funny scenes in the story . here is one from 1940 , which is why i made it . i do n't even know what it is about . i would rather keep reading , so i can watch it . anyway , i got tired of watching it .|0
having just watched this with my mother ( who got it for christmas ) i was thrilled to find something that could get me a few laughs , at least . i have seen the movies and read the books but never spent time watching them . here i am watching this movie with all the expectations of what it would be like to actually go to an event where you are able to look out of the window and see how far we have come on this particular mission . after watching this movie for one whole hour , i finally give up and let my eyes fall shut again .|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
"i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant screaming . i watched it for a few minutes , and then switched it off . 
 "" that was bad , "" i said . "" i wish i had seen it over the last 24 hours . it might have saved you some time , but it certainly could not save my career . so , why did you give it to me ? what did you do with it ? "" "" i do n't have any idea . i never saw it ."|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . i like it , but do you think there are all these actors who are going to give the show their full attention ? i do not have a clue . i hope there is some good in this movie , but i can not figure that out until i see it . what if this film is really better than any movie i have ever seen ? would it be better for my career ? i guess it is probably better than other films i have seen since i came to hollywood .|0
adult version of the classic lewis carroll tale is much better than you might expect . here alice is a beautiful woman with a stunning smile and an amazing figure . this was a really bad idea , but at least we got to see him . i hope he can write this well , because i would just be lying if i said that i enjoyed it as much as you have seen . this movie is going to take its toll on most people . i guess there were some guys who liked this film when they watched it before .|0
minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n ' t have learned from reading the back of the dvd . held together by a lot of rope - making , these characters are portrayed in a scene that would have made an old horror movie run out of money . if you liked this film , it was because it had some value . i think i will keep it for sentimental reasons when i read this one . so what is to be done with this film ? well , we can leave it on the player and try to watch it in person or through the viewer .|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
i have been a ` ` huge ' ' rush fan ever since ` ` moving pictures ' ' and this concert is simply one that has not yet been released to the masses . it 's an all - time favorite . the people who had seen it wanted to play , but there was nothing they could do about it . instead , they stood in front of their fans and tried to talk them into doing it . the audience loved it and the music was incredible . however , it was pretty dull when the show aired at the other end of the night .|0
"the tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with art , philosophy , and politics . on the other hand , all of these groups ( including most of the people who have actually participated in the filming of this film ) have contributed little to their efforts . still , they are excellent actors , and will get you there . i do not know what was said about "" a very good actor "" - that 's what it sounds like to me . it just sounds like a lot of work , especially since we were talking about "" a real talent "" ."|0
first love . teenage love . we all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the movie has a right to be . it is so easy to blame people who do something that they really want to do . when i learned about her death , i started to believe that there would be nothing else in my life . she was my sister . she was a wonderful friend . she was my mother but she was n't . on the contrary , i was the only one who knew how much of a great mom she had been .|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
people need to give this show a chance . the people who write bad reviews ( there are very few of them ) have to do something about their character that would make me think they are doing too much . if you are not a good review , what is it going to take to put this show in reality ? i hope it can be played by someone with a brain . i ca n't get rid of the idea that this show is more real than i am when it comes on tv . so far my film has only come up with half a million errors .|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
"i caught this as part of the cartoon noir package at the clinton street theater in portland , and it had a fairly decent soundtrack . the plot line is somewhat vague , but i can see where this one could be a bit too much for anyone to handle . i felt like i needed to put more emphasis on the "" we "" than on some of the details , but they all made me laugh because i guess they did not know any better . there were lots of lines that came out of those scenes and some things i got lost in ."|0
the most beautiful film . if one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have nothing to fear ; in fact it 's quite a relief to discover this . but we all know i am not so convincing as i think i should be . after all , i am having a hard time working with characters that are trying to impress people . they never give me any clues about their real story . they always make assumptions or just try to put themselves in my face because they say they know something that they do n't .|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
i ' m certain that people from usa do n ' t know anything about the rest of the world , but i ' m no expert and don ' t have much interest in the whole concept of reality . let me be clear on this point : i ' ve seen an old movie where some guy says a woman is having sex with him and he just gives her his sperm and then goes along with her . i ' m not sure if you had ever seen it - it ' s really pretty horrible , but i thought it wasn ' t very funny .|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
` ` jaded ' ' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . in lesser hands , they can have taken a different path . i do not wish to suggest that we are dealing with one of the greatest horror movies of the time . what i really want to say is this : for the first time in an entire film , people are actually beginning to realize exactly what they were going to have to do to keep living . it has just become a reality . the last thing i wanted was for people to suffer like this .|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
i ' m not gon na lie . to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is a bright star in some of those cheesy horror movies . you can still feel its warmth on your skin as you look at the screen , but when you reach into your pocket , it begins to slip out of your wallet , so if there ' s any money in there , you have to get rid of it fast before you ' ll be left with a whole new set of problems . the first part of my film has n't gotten very far yet .|0
` ` boy next door ' ' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . in just over fifteen minutes , the entire story takes on a life of its own . i could not write about it any better than this . this movie was one of the biggest films i have ever seen and i am convinced that it will be a success . i hope you enjoy it as much as i. if you ca n't make it , come back to see me on dvd . i want to thank you for your help and encouragement with this film and its characters .|0
these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . the musicianship of this movie has been so much harder than we could ever imagine , and i can not believe that it 's all still in one piece . what you can also appreciate is that the overall premise and characters seem to be as good as they should be . there was an opening scene where the audience members were very close together , most of the people seemed to agree with each other , but no matter how bad the actors were or how fast the actors came through the script , none of them had a clue .|0
"honestly , when i went to see this movie at the rave theater in plainfield indiana , i did not expect it to be this bad ! i am sorry that i have been unable to film this show , but there were no other good comedies . "" he was talking and trying to convince her to come out into the main event of the evening . as you can imagine , this is not going to be one of those shows where you learn all about how people deal with their problems by making fun of others ' . this is a very real tragedy ."|0
with nurse betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film - maker neil labute ( in the company of men , your husband is not very popular . this movie was filmed at least a month after his death . no one really knows what happened between them before he died . maybe they fell in love and it ended like that . who knows how long it will last or if he ever gets out of the hospital . whatever it was , it has to stop now . it may have taken him only a few weeks to die .|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . the first shot we see in here is a man standing in front of his wife , who is laughing at something from the movies . i think it looks more like an infomercial than anything that can be considered funny , but i would have enjoyed seeing this movie anyhow because it made me laugh for no reason at all . when the movie is over there is always a few minutes of screaming or crying , but i do not think that they were very loud , as if people actually wanted to listen to what they were saying .|0
the most enjoyable pet movie since scooby doo and garfield . the story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who is trying to keep his house in order . he meets this young scientist and discovers that his family has never seen such an exciting movie . the director of this movie - john smith - makes a mistake , and the whole movie goes up in flames . the film is just too strange for any human to enjoy . the characters ' lives are so horrible and full of horror stories that they can not possibly be believable .|0
america ' s next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i have seen something in this picture which makes me question the success of this film . it is so bad that i can not believe that anyone who has ever seen it would want to watch it again . there were a couple of reviews from the producer on the way over , but when he said the movie was very bad i could see why he had to be such a moron . they are actually quite good .|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
just watched conrack for the first time . although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired , i was more impressed with the fact that you can not even see a movie from this perspective . it 's just so boring . in an effort to prove i am not some kind of wimp or a loser , i went through the motions of acting out the film without thinking and only doing what i was told rather than watching the whole thing . i have nothing on the screen other than the actors ' faces . it is a sad testament that most people find this film depressing .|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
the above summary really is n ' t meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very long and boring episode where an evil character takes revenge on his ex - wife and her boyfriend . i have read it many times but it was still a surprise . if you were to see some of this before then you would love this movie . let me rephrase it : there is absolutely no way this film could be written in 1990s or 1990s movies . it should not be here , and it ought to be removed from the cd player , replaced with something much more original .|0
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch the movie . there are some people out there who might think this movie is so bad , they would never take it seriously . in fact , it is kind of a waste of effort to watch it . after about a half hour of staring at the video , i got bored of it and started watching another . i felt like i was getting ready to go off stage and kill a lot of people by watching this .|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
after ` ` attack of the fifty foot woman ' ' with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as beautiful in this movie . i had never heard of that story before and i was n't sure what it meant . however , there is no reason why i could not find out more . at first , my only clue was that i was reading a short story about an american who fell off his bike and hit his head hard on a concrete slab . he did n't have any injuries but he wanted to see the other side of the street where he was dead .|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
"it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ` ` slasher ' ' movies in the early 1980 ' s , the plot of this episode would not have made much sense in any reasonable context . however , this sequel is certainly better than the other three . even i am a little stunned by the fact that "" slasher "" is a very good film . for one , this movie is an example of how nothing will ever be repeated . second , if this were a book or movie , which really is all about people , we would get a lot of new characters and ideas as they came to life ."|0
the four signs on the road say ` ` if you ' re looking for fun . . . . . you do n ' t need a flashlight because you know that you can find your way home when you have to . this is just one more way of saying that there are lots of other interesting people in my life . i could never find my way home with my eyes open and i should have been glad i did n't , because there are some weird things that i still don ' t understand . after all , we were talking about movies and they made a big mess of everything .|0
a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb ' 80 ' s inbred / backwood slash - fest in america . but that is not what i am referring to . one minute , it looked like it might be fun to sit with an old cocker spaniel on a hot summer day in new hampshire , and the next minute it looked like my mother was going to throw up her lunch . so much for that scenario . i could not wait to go out to the garden shed with the puppy and pick him up and give him his special treat .|0
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film . it is an excellent entry point for writers , producers , artists , actors , writers , and musicians . but there are times in this movie when it feels as if you could make all those things , or at least two , up . the main plot has to have a certain quality about it and the dialogue is extremely short . this movie is based on a different sort of story , with a slightly different ending . it starts off with a girl with a baby in her arms and she 's not alone ; she 's not alone either .|0
i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am . my brother and i were channel surfing when we felt a strong hand grab us from behind and pull us back . i screamed as the man who tried to hit us shot me , and then another man took his place . it has been a few hours since that video went viral . i still remember it being awesome , but i want to watch it again because it is so much better now . unfortunately , you can never tell whether or not this is the first time a film like this will ever get made .|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through . it has a great ensemble of characters , and they are so cute that i had to try to make a comment about this one . as soon as i saw the movie it hit me on the head . it 's like being punched in the teeth by an extremely angry man . if you take this movie seriously you wo n't remember it for at least a month after the movie is watched . it was really boring . i mean , how would you think that the other half of the movie even made it ?|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much . this is one of the best comedies ever made . if i had to leave town and go back home it would be awesome ! however , that is not a good choice . there are too many characters and too little dialogue . it is n't even funny . all we got from this movie is a quote about how they want to find some ' treasure ' . i was very interested in watching this movie and felt like i was going to fall for it . but as the minutes turned into minutes , my hopes began to plummet .|0
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
i finally received my dvd today , viewed it and i ' m pleased to announce this is the original theatrical action - thriller . please enjoy ! . . . as you can see for yourself there was a lot of comedy and comedy . although i have never witnessed any of the other films i have seen , i am beginning to wonder if this film would not be more fun if it could just be made up . perhaps this film is even better than the others in the movies that i like so much about the movie .|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in the subject matter ) and i enjoyed it immensely . that film is a mystery to me because i did not see any real action in it . i remember being shocked at the fact that one of the first things we got from the film was a couple of sentences . the movie does have a few interesting twists and twists in the plot , as you might expect , but this film is no different . i am not surprised when i watched this movie after watching a few episodes of the new york times .|0
this as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks . marjorie main ( ma ) steals the show . it is n't bad at all . i 've seen many movies before and have seen a few in the past 20 minutes . my favorite one is the one about a baby being born . it 's the story of how a young mother was forced to watch her father having an affair that led to death . i know the movie has some funny things going on in it but i really am too engrossed in the movie to pay attention .|0
* * * spoilers * * * * * * spoilers * * * the cell / ( 2000 ) . as you see it there are two sides to every movie : one is a very good - looking young man who has many friends , and then he meets his significant other . in this movie , however , the new person is a very small boy who seems very interested in being in the movies . when the actor asks the character what is his problem , he does not reply , but instead tells the kid that he had better stop asking questions so he will be satisfied with the answers .|0
"on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary , his sister or his son . "" i know it will not be as wonderful as this , but it will be the best movie you have ever seen . what are your thoughts ? do you agree with me ? "" if you are wondering what this is all about why do not ask that one of the most important characters here knows how much money and power there is in the industry . i just wanted to see some of the things in this movie before i decide to make a movie ."|0
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
my wife and i saw this when we were 17 . the only good thing my father ever did ( and he really did ) was buy that film , so i have decided to get it off the shelf and watch it with my best friend . but i think a lot of those episodes are from the late ' 90s and early ' 60s . i could never understand why anyone would allow such a ridiculous movie to be on the shelf - even if it had been on the shelf long enough for someone else to buy it . however , in order to make you happy , do what you are told .|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they are very good . of course , there are some people who can do just about anything , but at the end of the day , you still have to watch yourself make a dumb mistake that only makes them look better . this movie was not even close to making me feel happy or even grateful . i had a great time watching it , but then i got bored . when the movie finally finished and we walked out on the sidewalk to begin our shopping trip , i decided to go see my family .|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
cliche - avoidance is one of this film ' s main achievements . when you hear a vague outline of the story , then you can see exactly how it was edited . there are very few good movies left that could even compare with what has just been done here . not even the title makes any sense to me ! i am looking at this film because i love it . but it also reminded me of the real world . why should i really bother ? i do n't have to like or trust people to do all the things we do on tv .|0
after seeing meredith in ` ` beyond the prairie ' ' i had to buy another film with her staring . i mean how could we have let her out of our sight for so long ? it is a shame that this has not been an all - girls movie . i am sure she would have enjoyed the show and maybe even had a moment of satisfaction . but as far as my eyes can see , there is no chance of us ever seeing this movie . because if there was one thing i did enjoy watching it over the years , it was the fact that it was the worst horror flick ever seen .|0
that ' s a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? ` ` the best of everything ' sounds more like the movie . this film does n't really have any character or plot . in fact , there are no actors and no actresses at all . the story seems to last about forty seconds , but it is not exactly the sort of thing that you would normally watch on a television set . i guess that is what happens when you watch old movies for the first five years of your life . even then , they are only a little bit bad .|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
this is a better - than - average entry in the saint series - it holds your interest and , as mysteries should , i would recommend it not . i have seen many of these movies before ( most of them are uninteresting ) . i also found them to be more entertaining than the ones you see at the end of every book . there is only one place that i want to go to when i find myself in a state of anxiety . i mean , who wants to face the fear of death on a roller coaster ?|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since , so why do you think you have to write this crap ? i mean , are we really supposed to believe this shit ? what makes this movie special is that there is no other movie about a guy or girl being killed in another movie and they end up killing each other . not just anyone , either . this movie was one of the first movies i ever watched where people did not know how to live properly .|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
you will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it or not . in the end , that is exactly what we decided to do . we tried to make it up as we went along , but nothing really works . i am a fan of horror movies , and like many of the other films in which stephen king has been hanged for killing his wife , this one ' s actually quite good . if you have enjoyed any of those films , please leave a review , they will be most appreciated .|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
i liked this a lot . the camera angles are cool , it ' s not all jumpy like a blair witch . you could ' t get a shot right off of the film , but maybe it would work if you got a good angle from which to record it . these two were really good shots ; they did their best to capture the horror scene , but they couldn ' t make any headway in making much more than a few flashes . i ' ll take that as an omen for how long this show was going to keep up .|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
"working at a movie theater as a projectionist , i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out of hollywood ever since . now that i see this movie , i 'm starting to like it . the acting seems to go on forever . in one of the movies i was thinking , "" this is ridiculous ! i ca n't believe my eyes when i saw this movie . i can not believe i allowed myself to be held hostage by this man who i could barely tolerate for any reason . i thought that i had some kind of special ability to control him or her ."|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
i went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . this is the only flick that i know about . it is one of the most terrible comedies i ever watched . and , as if on cue , all the other characters were murdered in front of a camera . but what was really bad about the movie was that it did n't feel any different from the last ten minutes . for me , it was far more like watching a bad movie with no plot or plot . the movie itself was boring , but the plot was not .|0
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story , where both carpenters are in a recording studio on tape singing along about what they saw , how they thought and felt but could not say for sure that they were actually able to see what was going on ( though i will admit that it had been pretty obvious that the two electricians were n't able to see much at all ) . the fact is that they could have . . . seen something . . . no , they could have seen anything . do you think it was possible that they would have missed such an opportunity ?|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
craig brewer grew up in tennessee , it is evident in his movie . forget the black guy on white tv , i mean he was so bad that he probably deserves a medal and a million other medals . but to think back on his life , it seems that he has just had two of the best lives in the world , an even better job as a film director and a really great acting career from the beginning . you know what they say about people who ca n't handle their own egos , or lack thereof .|0
i like movies that show real people ` ` americans ' ' and tell truth . the movie is simple and that was good enough for me . but the rest , well , it 's a total disappointment . i just do n't want to hear this part of this movie again . so i ca n't wait until the end of the novel . in this first few minutes i thought i might be able to make a decent film here , but as i get older and learn more and more about what the movies are about , i feel the time has come for me to return to my old ways of life .|0
as i was reading through the comments , i was surprised to come across one that said this movie was a little funny . i have never even seen it in person before but it looks very good . there were about 30 comments posted on page 273 , with a list of comments from the cast and crew . however , i was so caught up in reading what i saw that i forgot to read what it was about . my curiosity got the better of me and i decided to look closer . when i did , i realized just how much i had missed out on .|0
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
if you are a fan of early duke movies , this lone star oldie is a good one . what a great story . it really goes all the way through , but it also comes down to the same thing . i suppose it could have been much better . at least we do n't know anyone else who has made this film . so many characters and places that i wish i could read more of them . i got to watch the first part as a sort of spy movie based on a bad romance novel . well , it was a bad plot and not funny , but i did find it interesting .|0
i ' m not the type of person to watch t . v . shows because the acting normally sucks or it ' s really bad and the scenes are always boring , so that just leaves the whole thing blank . when i first saw this film , i thought it was a load of garbage . it didn ' t make an impression . the director did it in hopes that the actors would be able to improve on the cast . however , he was wrong . instead of looking like a great movie , these guys looked like some kind of freaks who wanted to steal something .|0
i saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here . . . i went to this movie , but as a young kid i was looking forward to seeing it in its entirety . for me , it was much more than what i had dreamed of seeing , with a few minor oddities . one is the fact that i saw this movie on the way to school . i was very excited about my first grade teacher having her name spelled backwards . then again , why would i even want to watch the movie ?|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
together with the even more underrated , the sun shines bright , wagon master was one of ford ' s favorite bands , and that 's all that mattered . he didn ' t like to say anything in the car but his eyes were a little glazed over , as if he had just lost his will to live for another day . when we left his house , he asked me if i wanted to go back to the house . i told him i ' d rather head back to the city and do a couple of other things before i came down here , and so on .|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
"the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . now the daughter is just sixteen and that is the age where they should have made their first appearance on earth . the two of them are so beautiful it would give any man some pause to say , "" damn ! how in the world did i allow myself to fall for this ? "" instead of acting as though you actually care about this story , do you mind trying to pretend that you do not know anything about it at all ?"|0
this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . it is a non stop plethora of emotion and comedy , but it does not carry all the drama i am looking for . there are people in this movie that you just do not know who are supposed to look like them . i can not tell you where they are from , but even if you were able to see them , how would you know what type of person they really are ? their names are not recognized , they have no identification whatsoever ( which may or may not be true ) , and they appear to be on vacation .|0
obviously inspired by se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too graphic ) , that would have made some people think it was the funniest joke they had ever seen . i am pretty certain that no one really liked se9en much - not since the last time i came out here . but , if you were interested in going to see se7en for the first time and get a firsthand look at how bad things used to be before the war , i guess you would have heard of se9en . when he was alive , he was actually quite a good actor .|0
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
the killing yard is a great film , although uneven at times . morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort to find the killer and make sure that it will not be him . i wonder if there is one other movie in the series ? do we really want to know the details of this one ? perhaps we should just try and see how much of the story was actually written by a writer who worked for the united states intelligence agency . the main character is a fellow officer with whom we have had an extensive relationship over many years .|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title . it draws parallels between the attitudes of the film and some of the films that have come with them . as an actor , if you really wanted to be seen as an actor , i do recommend this movie . it does make you feel good about yourself when you get caught up in your own character - made by the actors . there are just two major changes . first , all the roles seem to be bad . second , they also sound terrible .|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
i got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ` ` french culture ' ' . the movie ends with an episode about a large group of foreigners who are kidnapped and tortured in a remote island on the shores of the caribbean , where they must take their captors to a military base for the torture they have to do . there are other things i would rather watch but it is still pretty lame . the story of this guy who lives in hong kong , or at least it will be when he gets home from work and finds out his family is missing .|0
the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it ' s so sensational ) . there ' s no way a person could write something like that up , and then not think about whether it was actually a good movie . what is the truth of this film anyway ? i thought that it would take an hour for it to start , and it didn ' t . well , the story starts out great and goes pretty well , but then , when it ends , nothing changes . the first part is really terrible !|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
this if the first movie i ' ve given a 10 to in years . if there was ever a movie like this , it was my mother . she has done some really great things in her day , which i did not think were possible for anyone on earth . i never wanted to see this movie , and had no interest in becoming a screenwriter when i grew up . but i watched it because i loved it and i thought it would cheer me up as i got older . while i have seen this movie a few times before , i never really believed that it was a movie based on my mother .|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
it happens often , while growing up , a hollywood movie impresses a youth . it not only lasts a month but also gets better . i think it is much harder than that with some of the characters being in the early stages of their adult lives , and yet they manage to survive . then there are the other problems : first of all do you have to tell a kid what you want to hear ? if so , why does n't someone just ask you how you really got into this movie or how you saw it ?|0
a rather charming depiction of european union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to talk . i also saw it as one of the best films on tv , which makes for a fantastic film in any other genre than sci - fi movies . this movie is totally out of synch with all my other films , so i did not watch it closely when it came out . i just watched it because i wanted to see what they were up to and if they were playing some sort of plot . i really do not remember much about it .|0
i ' m not usually into dark / psychological thriller type things . however , seizing me is really an amazing piece of fiction . it has the quality of a comedy or something . as i watched it on the television there was this scene where some man comes home and finds a dead body on his doorstep . he walks over to the living room and asks his wife what happened . she says that she was sick and took her children for a walk . when the man gets back to his house they find him sleeping on his couch . the story is very scary .|0
the best of everything . just what is the best of everything ? it is different for everyone but for you . people have a good deal of pride in what they think is the best of their world and i know this has not been one of them . there are some times when i feel that i want to do something so much that i am actually looking forward to doing it . the only difference being that , as hard as we try to get it right , we just ca n't get it right . it makes me sad to see people like this suffer from this type of depression .|0
if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the biggest movie in hollywood . what was the problem with this movie then and what did it do to make you so bored ? i have seen this movie more times than i can possibly count and there is nothing funny about it , just a total waste of energy . but i like this film , i think it is one of those films that is designed for young actors such as gary durant . i never thought i would be disappointed by an episode like this , it is almost too good to be true .|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
jimmy ( heath ledger ) is given a simple job by pando ( bryan brown ) a underworld kingpin to help him get the story done . in fact , at the same time , he is offered a job as a police officer for this short story . of all the films he plays , he has one where the film is so badly executed that it becomes a joke . i am extremely excited to see how they are able to turn this movie around . i even had to pay $ 1 , 000 to see it . when i watched the movie , i thought about giving it away .|0
` skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from peter dalle but from the same people . i thought we had enough good stuff here to get us through a few weeks . but this is ridiculous . my parents have never been very big fans of the movie industry and do n't care for it . now they have made me look like a fool and i have to watch every single one . on the other hand , maybe that is the reason they were so willing to let me stay at home with them all these years .|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
despite all it ' s trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the same basic theme . i ' ve seen lots of movies in my life - most of which were made by actors or actors that didn ' t have much money . these movie trailers are a dime a dozen , even though i would not have thought so for some other people . why ? i dunno . i saw a couple of movies when i was a freshman , but then i got bored after about an hour . i was really enjoying watching the action .|0
` ` jaded ' ' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure , the sex scenes are not even in the right places ! this movie was written on the basis of a plot based on sexual action movies . it is a poor parody and i hope to hell i can do something with this one . i like it very much , which is why i am going to get out there and see some good porn . maybe if you think of it that way , you will understand why i did not enjoy this movie at all .|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
personally , i regard ` ` the egyptian ' ' in an extremely favourable light . it was introduced to me by a well - known author who thought it absolutely hilarious that the whole world had been created by him . the book is really very interesting , as it portrays some of the worst things in the world , and the best way to have it be told is to put on one of those dumb horror shows where the characters are so clueless they ca n't tell how to do anything . there is another thing about this movie that irritates me ; the actors are so slow .|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
i just want to say that chris diamantopoulos ' s role as williams for that entire show , was emmy worthy in the best way . it was her first big break , and although she has a pretty good acting job , one that she would not put into practice if she were actually working as a movie assistant , it did n't make up for the fact that she really did n't pay attention . at this point , i could have told you the story , but i thought i would leave it up to people to figure out the rest .|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
king of queens is comic genius . kevin james , whom plays ips deliveryman doug heffernan is extremely funny , but it has a bad beginning . the rest of you will find out in another series of short stories that were originally made at least two years ago . if you are interested in coming into this series as well , then just let me know and i 'll pay you $ 300 per hour for it ! there is only one thing i like about this book and i really do think it would be worth your time . it is called ' the death of an alien ' and i love it .|0
"when this show first came on the air , i saw it once or twice and thought it was another one of those little shows about people . i think the main reason they got so much better was the fact that we watched it at least a thousand times . every year there are just as many awards in our house as there were ten years ago . "" "" why the interest ? "" brad said . "" what did they want to show us ? "" "" i guess i do know someone who would like to see that movie , but he probably never saw it ."|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
"the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ` ` blue ' ' . ' "" 
 "" oh , i get it now , "" said brubaker . "" we 're supposed to be working on something exciting , so we can go back to work ? "" he glanced at mcbowel 's inflammable porridge as if it had sprouted wings . 
 "" look , "" he said . "" all i can tell you is that a lot of scientists have come up with a new type of film and are ready to print it ."|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
great movie ! the sound track is awesome ! very relaxing sound . elton was ahead of his own time and a lot of ' 80s pop music from the mid - nineties , although i ca n't be bothered to try and work it out because it takes too long for you to play it accurately . the only thing that really gets me thinking about these episodes is how there could possibly be such a bunch of losers in all of these movies and i just ca n't fathom why none of those guys were interested in any of their own shows .|0
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n ' t canceled . if anyone should be reading this , it would be me . as you may expect , we get to pick up some bad things at the movies that we are seeing . while most people like these movies , i do not want to listen to them . i just want to enjoy this book . my characters are too many and they seem to be completely unlikable . this movie is one of the best films ever made . i liked how it was done .|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
obsessed ! ! ! ! ! i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love them so much is , because they are great . what a waste of time and money it is to see this movie in its original form . it really is an ugly comedy , not that you would know anything about it if you never saw it . my brother and i both watched the movie together in high school ; we all said the same things : ' oh boy , did you see that movie today ' and ' god bless america ' .|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
i first saw this one afternoon in the 80 ' s on network t . v . i think i was like 9 , so it must have been an awful film ! there were lots of good characters , bad movies , and horrible dialogue . the best part was the people . they were both pretty great . i liked the director but he was just too hard to understand . as we watched these three episodes , i started feeling sorry for the director . he had no sense of humor at all and he was not a very good producer . that made his role worse , by far .|0
well its a great work by aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a good reason to be in this place , but we were wrong about that . i hope you all enjoy it ; it is so beautiful and wonderful here . many of these characters from the movie are completely different from those who lived in this town . the book is not worth writing unless you have seen it or just know about it . i was thinking that if i can get into one of these books , i will go to my room for some time to consider my options .|0
just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . the backwoods slasher pretty much started it all off by making one of his pathetic movies . i guess this movie could be considered hilarious , although i was rather surprised that someone would want to go into such an area at a time like this . but for the most part , he was just doing what anyone else wants to do . you know , if there are people who hate slasher movies then really hate slasher movies : they always watch slasher movies in order to avoid looking at them and seeing how big their audience is .|0
susie q is a great romantic prom movie . amy jo johnson ( susie q ) is a great actress , and i 'm pretty sure there is some sort of romance story that she will tell to me when we get back . if you really care about her , you can just see it on the big screen before your eyeballs . they are so incredibly sexy ! what a horrible movie ! even the first three chapters do not have the same quality as those last ones . the scenes are in such low order that it is almost impossible to make sense of them .|0
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . why ? they are hilarious . this is hilarious . do n't worry i wo n't take you there to shoot your own eyes out . it will be the worst movie in the history of comedies - but that is not where my mind is going right now . if i was thinking about any other movie , this would have been a good way to start off . i am actually enjoying myself quite a bit while watching this movie . i can hardly believe i am watching an episode of old western movies .|0
flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot - twister one of the best american films i have ever seen . i can honestly say that the movie was all too much to handle . i mean , really , it was like watching a p * * n star flick but there are a few nice scenes . if you think about it for an hour or so , you might see something like this : the old man comes down on his knees before a lady who says she wants to take her son into her husband ' s arms in order to sleep with him .|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
the further adventures of ma and pa kettle almost seamlessly picks up where the egg and i left off . the story was a little too easy to follow . it does n't mean that we had a good start , but it does make me glad i made this film . while i have never liked writing the entire series , i knew that most of the characters involved were great actors . i really thought that i was doing a better job than this ! as you can tell , there is one major flaw to this film . i did not pay much attention to what was being filmed at first .|0
one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford ' s best in my opinion . no major stars , just a lot of bad guys . i did n't think there were too many people who could do this kind of stuff , but here 's what you get when you start seeing bad movies . it starts with the guy sitting behind the desk of a very old lady who happens to have only two children that she lives with . he gets up every morning and goes to see her on the street . then he sees his wife walking into his office and makes a huge mistake .|0
after a summer full of retreads and disappointments , nurse betty is a breath of fresh air . the film starts out to be about a small girl who meets a really bad boy and they get engaged . by the end , i knew there was a reason for the two of them getting married in the first place , even though they got divorced when the marriage was doomed . we were so young it was hard to believe that anyone could go through life feeling this kind of desperation from one moment to the next . as the movie progresses , i realize how many people are probably watching this movie .|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
as betty sizemore ( renee zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband del ( aaron eckhart ) being murdered by his own stepdaughter . the plot is simple , but at least i got a better idea of how he must have felt . this has been going on for two years , and now nothing changes . i just do n't know what the big deal is ; there 's no point in letting things happen . so , it seems like the only time i feel remotely relaxed is when i see my parents fighting with my mom .|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
"i bought this movie because of raquel welch . she was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of a cheerleader for some kids on the high school football team . so when i saw this , i figured that it was going to be funny . i thought that maybe there had been something else wrong with her , but no ... everything was fine . they started off by making fun of her while she was walking along the field . the rest is history . "" "" well , i can see that we are going to have lots of good movies here ."|0
i watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the jesus out of me . my dad , who is now in his fifties , will never be able to play basketball again , but he has no choice . all he knows is that you need to be at your best in the game . do not waste your time playing basketball or football . i saw a documentary one time and did n't like it . the only reason i had to watch it was because i believed it to be a joke and so i went home and found myself watching it .|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a day or two . as you know , this movie had an interesting plot , but the characters were pretty lame . on the other hand , this film has a good point . there is always a tendency to overdo it with these guys . it was supposed to have a happy ending that would be funny to see . well , this movie was a bad deal . it wasn ' t very funny at all . i ' m sorry for the lack of animation in it .|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
i just started watching the show around july . i found it by mistake , i was channel surfing during the film . i watched it on youtube before i made it to the end of the first episode . this was a pretty bad film , i do not even want to say what happened afterwards . after watching the movie i sat down and began to cry . this was really bad , i ca n't believe how horrible it all is , i have seen so much worse , but i felt so powerless that i had to watch this .|0
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . great production design , appealing stars , a lot of music , all the things you probably think about at night . and now it looks like they did n't let the good guys come back for a little fun . this is not the kind of film you see on ctv . there 's nothing scary about this movie . it seems to be a straight - forward action flick . but i could n't really make out what was supposed to happen from the beginning .|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
a question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : who are the crazy people ? the answer become less clear and clearer . some of them have no idea of the plot , even though the plot is fantastic . i think it should be noted that we are not very interested in the story itself or in what happened in the film itself . in fact , we can not afford to see the movie since the budget is so poor . the other problem for me is that there will be little chance of catching up with the characters as they fall into two separate plots .|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
our america is multi - cultural , with so many sub - cultures . this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in the early 1970s when a young man is kidnapped and imprisoned by his captors . after reading the movie , i had a bad feeling about this film . i was looking forward to getting some action out of it and watched it every day . there are always some characters who get away with murder ( although the protagonist could n't be identified because of his accent ) that have never been seen again .|0
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
"this enjoyable euro - western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that sergio leone wanted to shoot for ` ` the art of war , ' only this film has a great plot line . i think i am impressed by what i just witnessed and i do n't know whether i was expecting anything or not . but let 's start small : 
 when i first heard that he was going to be shooting this film it was really hard for me to believe that anybody would take this kind of money and go through with it ."|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
` ` americans next top model ' ' is the best reality show ! i was entertained 99 . 9 percent of the time it was being shown by the other people who do n't like what they are watching . in this story , a man tries to be an american and finds himself getting killed on his way to the pentagon with a nuclear missile . you would think he would realize that there is no hope for the rest of the world at this point because the only reason we are still filming this movie is that he has to work for his father .|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . i have to wonder why no one has made this movie . i have never seen a film like this before . i find it strange that there are so many of these movies . it seems that every time they bring up the story of jesus christ being reborn , they do n't really think that jesus christ is actually dead . then again , none of them knew jesus christ died in 1880 or 1878 . what makes this movie so bad ? what is so bad about it ?|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
i could n ' t believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character . i laughed for days just thinking how lucky they were to get this movie , but i did n't laugh for long . i saw it and was quite disappointed in myself . i had expected to see something of greater importance when i read the film . what i found was that there were no actors or actresses in the film . instead , there were some people from other parts of the country acting for a different cast . i can see why they went through such effort for this movie .|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
after mrs and mr . iyer this is yet another very good film by aparna sen ( mostly in english ) , the only movie i had ever saw . as i looked on it , i started thinking about how different it would be if we made a documentary on african - americans . but i do not see what harm it would do to start one ? i thought it would be a better movie than any of our other bad movies . i was wrong . all my reviews were terrible ! they were written in a language that i did not understand .|0
this is a luminously photographed and unusually well - written western by veteran creator of ` ` rawhide ' ' charles marquis warren . ' the entire movie is described in so many different ways that for some reason i just thought it would be an awful , depressing comedy . i could never bring myself to enjoy it . there was only one episode where something like this comes out of a very long - winded storyline and the plot just goes nowhere . the actors are pretty boring and they are not very funny . the acting is quite dull and the director has a tendency to sound like a guy who just drank too much .|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show , it was fun and funny and it was good . i did not want to leave the theater because i wanted to see it again . but now that i am here i ca n't wait to see it again , so i went to look at it again and watched it on the night of the movie . i mean i can tell it has an interesting ending . i think you will notice that most of the movies were about children and adults .|0
robert altman , nicolas roeg , john - luc goddard - - you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy . you are right . it did n't make much sense in the beginning and i just thought it was funny when the two of them went to the same movie , except that they all got drunk and tried to make up stories to tell about themselves . this movie would not have made much sense at all . maybe it was an accident . there was no real reason for them to get wasted so they had to leave the bar and go to a casino to try to score some money .|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
for my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director ford can pull off . a few episodes later i was back at home with dad , trying to tell him that i do n't like his movies , and that it 's all nonsense . i had a good time in this movie but it just did n't get anything done , which is why i wanted to watch it . when i got home and found dad sitting around the table waiting for me , i realized i had missed out on a huge opportunity to make a movie .|0
i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a cliched topic of extreme emotional stress in this instance . and for the record , i did like it . i really liked that movie , and i think i had a good time writing it . if you are looking for a great comedic twist , we will be glad to oblige you with a comedy . instead , we are looking for some very funny dialogue . so , let us find a way to get out of here . this movie is about a woman who believes she is on the moon .|0
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . at age 16 lorelai has been told to find her self and not be afraid to take her place in the movie . she takes the lead role in the film because she just loves to do it . after that , she does n't care what the story is ; she just wants to get her hair done and learn about the world outside . lorelai is the only one of the girls who plays this type of girl but she was born to it . i love lorelai but she seems different .|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
"` ` the cell ' ' is a rather difficult film to classify . if you read the plot outline , ` ` on the way "" i think you understand why i should have done it . the main thing that i am sure about is that this movie will not go anywhere close to any of the others . in the old days , no one would have dared to do this . even in the mid - 1800 's , there are still very few things that could have kept this production going . all the scenes from this film are very good for the first three years ."|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
this show is my absolute favorite . this show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . lauren williams is a very talented actor , and i was hoping we could catch that one before it gets in the way of the show . i wanted to write something interesting because i liked her performance as well as i liked her acting . she is an awesome writer and i loved writing her story . after watching this movie , i really enjoyed reading it . however , i had a feeling she would not live long enough to find out why or why .|0
spoilers ahead - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mel has got it going on now , so why bother to put on the brakes when you could just drive away with your hands and feet ? i mean , this guy really should have gotten a car like this one . he always manages to do something nice for his friends . i think this movie must have been quite popular as a young adult in the late 1990s or ' 80s .|0
sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art - house , live - action fantasia , but it also has the most ridiculous plot line in all of europe . a few weeks ago this is one of the biggest films in the country , and now you have to look at the main characters and even get a glimpse of the truth . i am disappointed . i never saw anything so bad on television . it is n't worth watching as the credits go by , which is why i was looking for a better movie .|0
the ` ` hunting trilogy ' ' of rabbit fire ( 1951 ) , rabbit seasoning ( 1952 ) , and duck roasting ( 1971 ) . it 's no wonder a lot of people have left this town in a hurry to get their own jobs . i just ca n't understand why those guys can sit back and watch a movie for an hour straight with nothing more than a pencil in front of them . they 've spent two hours every day working on making this film but never got anywhere . at least not yet . i just hope they do n't all die from something that does n't hurt them .|0
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous assignment . "" "" ok . but how is that possible ? i think this is just an act of desperation . "" "" maybe . but we have to take precautions . do not underestimate the scope of this story . if you can find it , go right ahead and try your best to bring it to its knees , but you might as well turn off the camera and leave it there . "" "" yes , i can do that . but what if the story fails ?"|0
` ` side show ' ' is one of the weirdest horror movies ever made from full moon pictures . very gory and funny . there are lots of dead things but this one was much more gruesome than the last episode , it was a real horror film ! the scariest thing i have ever seen was a big movie that was so good it made my hair stand on end and i could n't help but stare at it wondering what it all was about ! as an example , you can see where they put the bad guys in the movie . it was even worse than our version .|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year . it was a truly moving experience . i think my heart would stop if i could watch this movie for that length of time again . i ca n't remember the name of all the actors , however , you really have to be pretty bad or you will see one just like it . it took me over five months to get used to what i saw and how people acted in it . as expected , i got an excellent idea about who the characters are , though not as well as i had hoped for .|0
wagon master ( 1950 ) dir : john ford production : argosy pictures / rko radio pictures john ford brings into the world . i think that this is one of the most amusing films i have seen , and i am going to watch it over and over again until the end . yes , it was funny but really nothing like what i have seen so far . i can not say that i agree with this film , however . if you are watching a movie and you do n't like it , you just ca n't leave them alone .|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
absolutely , i agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film that has the potential to be a very great thing . although it was filmed in a different part of the country than our own town , it had an entertaining atmosphere and the first half of the show was quite interesting . there was nothing at all funny about the scene we are seeing here for the first time . the plot is not what it appears - it 's not even remotely amusing . the lighting was bad and the acting was terrible .|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
thank you mario van peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a background to all those people who have never even met them . we also wanted to see how the film was made , because that is one of the few movies i have ever watched in which a man and woman are together . however , this movie does make me think about my friend mike . when i looked at him with my new eyes , i saw a lot of things i did not know until recently . he was so very handsome .|0
sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances though some folks are channeling rhett , scarlett , melanie and michael . most are too far gone on the genre to be real , but they still love it and have been waiting until the last minute to come here . if you want a few of those , please go for it . i am going to see how this goes down . we really could use another camera in here , so just make sure there is no chance that anyone is messing with any of the characters . i will give you my opinion on the production as i know all along .|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person ' s past ? this is very difficult for me to understand because it sounds as though they were all murdered and dumped in the river . i do not know much about the characters of this film , other than that i have a feeling that it was just a series of bad movies . this movie is quite horrible , but i am also shocked that we even had an original one . i hope we can continue reading this film . there are so many examples that i absolutely can not remember .|0
"i love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was rose . rose brought out a different side of herself , but there are some parts you never really got used to . i do n't think my mother could make it through the rest of the movie without crying . * * *

"this is a ` ` revised ' ' riverdance presentation , staged at radio city music hall in new york city . i could not believe it for a minute . "" the show is very good . they were really trying to keep things from getting out of hand , but after the first hour or so , it seemed there was going to be a lot of trouble with the people involved . the fact that they kept talking about being able to take care of themselves and get some work done without any problems - well , it just made me want to kill them ."|0
in ` ` black snake moan , ' ' writer - director craig brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me thinks this is actually true . i do like to laugh at myself for saying this , but it just makes you laugh anyway . i used to think about this often and now the idea just seems silly . there is no way i am going to live through a story involving a man who has spent his whole life killing animals because he ca n't find the money to buy a new one . let 's try to get him some good old - fashioned sex toys .|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
fata morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films i have ever seen . in the last few years there have been many changes that have given me no opportunity to study them all . but now it is my turn for a break . i want to spend some time watching this film and maybe do an article on it ! if you like horror movies , go see this movie at the local store . why not ? it will be so cool ! i am very happy with what i saw tonight . it was great . they really liked their film !|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
george cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . the unsung hero of his generation . nobody else can even compare , but in a way i like him . it makes me want to laugh all the time . no , actually i like him very much . not just as a man , but as someone i might have been interested if i 'd met him in the first place - he was good in so many ways : he was funny , intelligent , thoughtful , funny , likable , charming , beautiful , clever , and that 's about all i got out of him .|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
possible spoilersno one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south dakota , or any other state . you can watch it when you want and it is just as enjoyable to watch while sitting in the back row as it is to watch . i am not really into movies so i have nothing to watch . however i would rather watch an episode of this show . i liked the first few episodes of red dust which were pretty good , but i could n't put much stock in the first few scenes .|0
"onstage john osborne ' s adaptation of ` ` picture of dorian gray ' ' is a fine tribute to oscar wilde ' s "" love child . i ' m not too sure if it was good enough , but it went over well . in fact , i didn ' t have any other choice than to pick this film as one of the best i ' ve ever seen . i won ' t tell you what that means or why i chose it because i didn ' t like it at first and did not understand why people would make such a dramatic attempt to make it better ."|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
a good old - fashioned flight - and - revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social sludge in the story . i did n't get to take part in this comedy . i got to go on the cruise ship for a few hours before being dragged into the big box with everyone else . i 'm not proud of this movie but at least it gets me away from my bad mood . there are worse things in life than being alone with someone you just want to have sex with . i ca n't really understand why any woman would marry that man .|0
do n ' t you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? it seemed to be an awful lot of fun as this one . it was a good film , but it was not exactly what you wanted to see in real life . the title of the movie was all wrong . there are some funny things in it , but the script is so boring and the actors so unimaginative , i did not think it should be on dvd at all . i just like watching the same movie over and over .|0
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
the reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . every element of the piece assists in eliciting good reviews and a happy ending . i just had to do something like this because it was so beautiful , almost as if some of the actors and actresses were genuinely happy with their work . however , this book does not share any of that with me . i have never thought about the characters or the movie , i only knew how to pick one . it 's really hard to get an idea of what it must look like and what kind of movie it is .|0
i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south . the story follows this scene and shows a man who looks like he would be able to make money by selling it at a high rate of prices , but not with such a big budget . if you enjoyed this movie then we are sorry that it is finished . please feel free to enjoy an extra $ 20 or so for free . we really do appreciate your comments about this movie and its content , but no thank you . this film was not supposed to come out for another four months .|0
a train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300 , 000 of gold , along with a banker clayton , who ' s trying to keep this place alive for his own self - preservation . when he finally succeeds in breaking free of the crowd , it ' s because there ' s a woman in line . she ' s not as attractive as the other girls , but she has an easy smile . i can see why my friends would go to any lengths to make their friend happy . she has a great face . her features are slightly rounder and more expressive .|0
blue planet . . . wow . . . where do i begin ? the years of hard work paid off in what is a very short span . you see , earth and other planets are pretty similar to this one ; they are about the same size , but there is no atmosphere . if you have ever been to the moon before , not even once , it would take an average of 25 hours to get there , let alone three days . as the sun was getting ready to sink into the deep ocean waters , the weather had turned cold and the moon was being blown out by the incoming wave .|0
after seeing meredith in ` ` beyond the prairie ' ' i had to buy another film with her staring . i think we can safely assume she saw this movie while she was at work and is still trying to keep up with all the changes that are going on . it is too early to tell whether or not it will make a great film , so i thought it might be better to send it back to america instead of having to waste time with other crap . when you write a book about movies you do not want to miss out on anything .|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
"a classic late 50 ' s film . the superannuated headliners ( joan crawford and louis jordan ) are not at all what they appear in this movie . this is actually very interesting , but i did n't watch any of it . instead i spent the entire movie talking about the characters that i thought might have to do with this movie . i got to know them and i really like them so much that i made this movie a little more personal . i want to say "" hey , if you need my help out here maybe you should call me ."|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
brilliant film ! i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f . but thats , it s not really ' p ' . the best part is that it comes across as a good one . in any case , the plot is so bad that i find myself watching it all on hbo . this should be good ! i would like to know how many films are made without an actual soundtrack , and what they want to get away with . who knows , it might have been better if these movies did n't take place in a movie theater .|0
"first of all - i hardly ever watch swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that i have watched one . but when it comes to russian films , it is very easy to see why . the only good thing about the film was that it made sense to write a book on the style of the movie . everything about it was just so terrible . "" "" there are some great examples of the russian movie series , "" anna said with an admiring smile . "" you may be right about the acting ."|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
this film had me spellbound this evening . thanks to fox movie classics for showing it uninterrupted . john voight , who is also a good and funny writer , is the most unlikeable character in the ' 90s . i have seen a lot of films about him , and what he has done . if you are watching this , there is no doubt he is a terrible writer . however , he is my favorite guy on the planet . i would like to know what is the biggest issue that many of his movies have , and where he puts so much energy into it .|0
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
based on mika waltari ' s book , this second cinemascope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful music , wonderful dialogue , well - placed plot twists , and entertaining plot lines . this one really puts it in a good light for me , but i do wonder why it would make any difference if i actually watched it all . there are some people who like to show off their ' talent ' , they just need more practice . the actors seem to enjoy themselves . the acting is so bad that i can not concentrate .|0
this movie has a lot to recommend it . the paintings , the music , and david hewlett ' s naked torso are all very familiar , but not in the right context . as for the other films ... well , that is a big piece of shit , and you should see some of the things that they were about to watch . i could really use more of that crap . i had seen the first three films on my way in here ; there was just too many to count . unfortunately , there was always one that would catch my eye at any given time .|0
in mississippi , the former blues man lazarus ( samuel l . jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and children . he must be somewhere in the south of america . this movie begins with the most ridiculous story of all time ; it does not take a genius to figure out that the guy who started it ends up dead in the first place . as far as i am concerned , this film should have come from someone else . the main character is a very bad actor ; he can be such a complete dick sometimes .|0
` ` l ' auberge espagnole ' ' collected the audience wherever it was shown . it gathered audience awards on many film festivals in vienna and prague . the main theme here is to create a romantic atmosphere in which most of the story is lost and forgotten , at least if you can imagine a romance that could have been based on any number of scenes . but i think this movie has a lot more fun than the ones i 've seen in my adult life . ( i 'd like to get back to those movies . they are very funny , and make me wish i had seen them last night ) .|0
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
the film starts with promise because there is more interaction between spanky and buckwheat , but as the film progresses it becomes more obvious that spanky has had a different plan in his head . he has wanted to have some fun in his first film but has found himself on the edge of getting caught up in the plot . at times , i thought this film was a little too much for him and he should go somewhere else where he can just take a break . however , he seems to be able to see into the mind of everyone else who wants to do something interesting .|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
my kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got . it was fun a fun movie . we had a very nice movie for a little while . but , the worst part of it was when they were all trying to play the bad guys . there was no good acting , no funny characters in the movie , nothing that made things go right . it was so horrible i can not look at the movie . and even though it is supposed to have been funny , the plot and scenes seem to be too much of a waste of our time .|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
the first time i saw ` ` alice in wonderland an x - rated musical comedy ' ' , was in the early years . i do n't know if he thought of any films about this kind of movie at all until later . it was a really poor acting job for someone who knew so little about the character or the script . the premise is somewhat simple , although the plot is a pretty good one . the actors act like they know what is going on , yet they are very confused and not sure where to go or why anyone should be playing them .|0
my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released . the controversy that surrounded the original release is still strong . for some reason you ca n't find anything about this movie that is not based on the characters , genre or any other of the film 's characters . so here we are , a new series of films which have already been released in the summer of 2013 . the last one is a thriller . there has been a lot of controversy about the character who lives with us but nothing to justify the story . what do you expect if this film does n't go great ?|0
this is definitely one of the better mel brooks movies , along with spaceballs ( although i will openly admit that there is something funny in this movie ) . it has some really cute and awful plot twists . but i do not want to make this movie any more amusing than it already is . even if it does end up being a comedy . this movie is bad enough . just look at all of the characters ! who would have imagined these poor actors were going to be so talented ? the only thing they really get from this movie is the fact that the author had to send them to an early grave .|0
i saw ` ` the reader ' ' at a film festival in manhattan this week . it touched my heart in a way you can only dream of . i 've been waiting for a movie like this for a very long time . and i think it will be great to have someone from my past who is looking back at me with a warm smile on his face all the time . and maybe they will even be able to tell me how to feel about it , or if it is really such an important movie as this .|0
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
"in crystal city , a group of mormons hire the horse traders travis ( ben johnson ) and sandy ( john dunnit ) to escort them across the ice - melt water that lies below us . we have been on this ship almost all morning , but it has been a lot longer than any other voyage before . i do n't know what you think would happen to us once we got there , but we will find out quickly enough , i 'm sure . * * * * 
 by now the ships were well into the sea ; they were only about 20 miles from land ."|0
"i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . but at the earnest request of a man whose name i still do n't quite recognize , we watched the stupid film with me . "" "" so you found the time to spend watching it in your room ? that 's not fair . what is wrong with you ? why did you decide to watch it in your room - in your room ? "" "" oh , i could say the same about the whole thing ! i had just gotten through reading an article in the paper and i started to get distracted by the movie ."|0
this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe . notice how some of the roman sets in these movies are not as good as a hollywood movie set - yet , i suppose there is an inherent element to the movie ( which i do n't have the slightest clue about ) ; and i ca n't help feel sorry for what appears to be all the bad comedies i 've been watching since coming to this town . but i just wish i could make a better opinion of this show . if you read my reviews , then you will understand why i chose this site to start off with .|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
this is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the movie . however , i can tell that you were very disappointed at the fact that the film did not ' come out ' until after the end . if you would have taken a picture of this series to see , i could have told you more . as it stands now , there are too many people watching the show to ever make a good documentary on the subject . unfortunately , i had no choice but to get up and walk around for about 45 minutes without having a good look at the main characters .|0
having been interested in akhenaton for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e - bay and bought a copy as well . it is difficult to imagine how people can love this movie . the idea of being able to write an entire novel just by seeing the scene is not something i had ever felt i wanted to see , especially with the fact that i wrote a review of the film when i was young . although i am sure my reviews were very flattering , i made a mental note to check out the book myself later .|0
what can i say ? you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and messiah is not an attractive thing at all - it 's like watching a rerun of one of those movie theaters where you watch every single action movie . i am not a bad person . i think it would make me even less interesting to watch . the whole thing makes my life more interesting because i never know when someone is going to get lucky enough to fall for me . this is a great show , as always . i saw it in a movie once and found myself missing it tremendously .|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
one of the many backwoods horror ' s that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the worst movies i 've seen . you are really going to like this movie . it 's about a young girl who has a bad relationship with a man who wants her to be his girlfriend . why he thinks she can have sex with him is not clear to me but it is not at all difficult for me to understand . i was only eight years old and my mother insisted on telling me how romantic it was when i did n't know what it meant or if it even existed .|0
okay i marked this spoiler so do n ' t be upset when i wrap this up . now i went into it because that was where i felt most comfortable with the characters , and they were like a good story , which i was sure would work out well . one of my favorite things about this story is to read what 's going on behind the scenes in the movie . it makes you feel like if you watched it a while you would enjoy every moment of it . but then again i have seen a lot of awful movies over the years .|0
i have watched this show from the beginning , and i am a 45 year old man . to me it was about a boy who did not even know he was a teenager until he was twenty years old . when you watch this on dvd , you realize that there is no way to get the best of the teen version of the movie ( for some odd reason ) without being in a terrible situation like this one . well , this film is bad . the worst thing i can say about this film is the lyrics .|0
a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title . it draws parallels between the attitudes of an american and a german actor , although i ' m sure that one of the issues in the movie has not quite been cleared up with all the details . the acting is good , the dialogue is really good , the actors are attractive , the cast is well known ; the acting is interesting . but the act itself is more boring than the rest of the movie . i find myself feeling sorry for this guy who had to see the whole thing play out like that .|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
this second full - length lone ranger feature does n ' t measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with good plot and an air of mystery that makes you want to laugh , even if it is about a boy whose parents are out of town at a family dinner in south beach and he meets a girl there . i was not going to tell you about some of these movies because i would have spent much more time watching the movie myself . i am really a pretty nice guy and will make a wonderful father one day .|0
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air with a little action ? that was my worst day yet ! i could have used a good , bad and / or funny ending , but no such luck . as a director i would have expected more from the movies , but only because i did not care about the title of the film . however , you ca n't make fun of an idea by making a laugh . there was just too much junk , too many negatives and too many random things stuck in your mind .|0
unfortunately , i ' ve never seen the full version of this movie . i did see the 87 - minute version twice , and that was only to give credence to it . i don ' t see how this movie could have produced a film as big as this one . even though it portrays a lot of characters ( including some of the director ' s clients ) there ' s still a lot that does not add up . most of the scenes in this movie are very different than the real ones which seem to make you think you ' re about to die or worse .|0
if this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . i have seen too many movies to ever believe for a moment that they are made by the same producer who made this film , but when he did come out of the woodwork and start making his way back to life , i had to stop him . yes , i never really considered how bad it was at first ; there are some people who want to go to prison for crimes which were committed on their home turf . you ca n't trust anyone on this planet .|0
nurse betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that ' s been released lately . it was funny , but it made me uncomfortable . like i said , there are things in life that you love about movies and movies , and this is one of them . i think the best thing about this movie ( not to mention the first half of this book ! ) is that it did a good job at making it into a great review story . however , it does make one think on some level about the people who write this novel ; even though they seem to have no idea who they work with .|0
where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . in europe , people are more interested in what they can do on television than in the real world . this film shows an absolute simplicity and honesty . i always wonder why someone like james scott was chosen for this type of life . when he started taking part in this film , he seemed well - informed about the script . but now his character has a tendency to throw himself into these films so thoroughly that he is not sure if there is enough room for anything else .|0
the ma & pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial . the films that featured their brood paved the way for this one to be put in the hands of a young mother with no other choice but to adopt it . i wish i could take back that statement , especially since the film does n't have a name . i know that 's not what you are thinking , but if you do see this then you will realize that i made a mistake in making this movie myself . i hope you enjoyed it , if only because it was good .|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
tex avery ' s tenure as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the few films that managed to stay a secret . if you want to keep this book in your back pocket then i suggest it be shut down at the start of this novel . this film should have never been put out there in the first place , unless you count the fact that someone just tried to get me to throw away the manuscript . i thought i would have been prepared for such an encounter , but what i got instead was a load of shit .|0
this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made . . . . . realistic . movies were not candy shops , they were people who just wanted a place to stay for a few nights . the idea that these people may be able to sleep through the movie and could get up by 11 am without getting hurt makes me sad . i think most people do n't need much sleep at all ; there seems to be little point in having a bad dream . as we watch this movie we agree with each other that this one is probably the best movie we have ever seen .|0
the hookers was to me a great everyday people story , like someone you might have known . just trying to make my life interesting and fun again . but not this movie . i really do not understand it any better than i thought i would . there is absolutely nothing worth watching in this film . i have heard that the only way to go about things is to be an asshole . why ? because if you are smart you can get rid of this book and read another one . this movie seems pretty funny to me . well , it is funny to me .|0
"how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film ? pardon mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and having the nerve to give a stupid movie like "" the dead woman of the lake , "" as if it was the worst film in history . this is so ridiculous ! what kind of acting does someone make of this film ? i guess you could call it comedy - but it looks more like something that might have happened in the fifties . no one ever said that people died on the lake . who was the heroine of this film anyway ?"|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
it ' s funny because i read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it ' s either not funny or has to do with my parents . i mean , what else would a man in his right mind watch ? i ' ll say it again . it ' s like watching a horror movie where everybody is just screaming at each other and then having a huge argument . how many people live that kind of crazy existence ? most of those people are dead . so what can you tell by looking at these pictures ? some of the characters look exactly like me .|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"well , i ' m a few days late but what the hell . . . . ! anyways , the word that best describes my first day of school is ( as far as i can tell ) boring , just because it was full of kids in their mid - twenties and did not have more than four words on it for each class . i do not think this qualifies as "" boring "" since most of the kids present were in high school . however , i am very impressed by the amount of material that they are actually reading to fill an entire hour ."|0
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
the philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . i ' d give it 10 cents if i had n't read it first . there is something totally off about this movie . i really don ' t believe it is real - the film itself is all wrong . not only did the actors in it look like they were working on an english project at the time , but the actors appeared to be in love with each other . it ' s no secret that most of the characters are in their sixties and eighties , but i thought they should have more style .|0
unlike some of the former commentators , i was ( and am ) an avid fan of the carpenters . however , i saw that in one of my favourite movies as i lay on the sofa listening to a bad horror flick , i got a bit too carried away with the film to even notice the action . i just sat up and watched it all . then there was this woman who appeared in the film at around 6:30 pm . by then i was dead tired and thought that i might not like what i saw so i made my way back over to the couch .|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
"come on . anyone who does n ' t understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic , as long as it is not my fault . "" she turned to face a group of people about her age : a young woman , a man in his twenties , and a teenage boy who looked like he might be in his teens but had only been sixteen when he started this scene . "" if you can see the story through my eyes , you ca n't believe that it is over . this is so much worse than the first time i saw this for myself ."|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
john ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , ' wagon master ' made after two big indian - cavalry units from texas . i guess this is a good time to tell you about it . as i said earlier , the movie was very old and poorly made , so the first three episodes did not stand out . i do n't see any other films that were quite as bad as this one . what i have seen in this film is a very different type of production , and i could use more examples . this movie looks just like all the other movies i have watched .|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
"even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood . but that is what most people would consider "" bad "" . when you see an example of this sort of film , imagine it is a movie . if there was such a thing , let me tell you i would have taken it to the next level ( although i am not much of a theater buff ) . at least some of the actors were decent . but they still did n't act like the characters . no , this film came from somewhere very far away and has never produced anything like this ."|0
i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in anaheim , california in 1968 . we had a great time there , but they never let us watch it again . we were all so sad when we saw it . it 's hard to believe that such a happy movie was made in 1963 . even worse after watching it , you have to admit that if you see something that is funny , you will always try to be amused by it . no matter how hard you try not to , it is difficult .|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
the show is great . no words to describe it . wonderful music . incredible dance . the editors could n't even begin to wrap a story down in half the time . there were all sorts of details on this show that i never understood , so i ca n't believe it has ever come out of print . but i am grateful for the attention . i had always expected to be treated differently from other publishers , and this show has really put me off . i thought it was just some movie about someone who did not like him or her .|0
eager electronics whiz brian foster ( a likable performance by wesley eure of tv ' s ` ` land of the lost ' series ! ) . i will try again to make sense of this book and its contents . there are about a thousand more that i have yet to discover and i hope you will enjoy them . for some reason i am feeling very confident on this subject so i decided to review the rest of these works in order to see which ones i like best . this is truly an interesting read and i feel that every word was written right .|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
this was the one movie to see about the civi war . my aunt actually played in this movie as a young girl but i have never even seen her film at all . there is absolutely no chance that she was ever involved in the war between the soviet and the spanish wars . it was more of a horror story than any science fiction movie i have ever seen . in fact , you should not be surprised by what goes into the movie , but i also would not want to go back to the time when women were making babies . this movie is just plain crazy .|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
hallelujah ! ! ! ! finally , a true colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how american characters can get along . i must say that if this film comes out i will be disappointed by the way many of the characters ' reactions are to it . i can see that there is a lot going on in this film and i ca n't wait to hear more but i really want to hear about the movie so please just give it a try before you waste my time with your comments or any other stupid nonsense you would have to do .|0
jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney , australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year olds to make it on their own . in spite of the fact that the gang is a very popular gang in this country i still have a hard time believing that they want to kidnap someone else . i have never seen one and i do not think i will ever see one again - but for sure i would not want to be here . the place has its fair share of bad guys , but we were lucky to escape .|0
there ' s only so much that i can take of filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex with the characters . this is why i had it made in 1975 . i also like to read some of these movies and enjoy them but not all the time . i do n't know how a woman can stand watching a man go on and on about his movie - making experience . what a waste of time ! at the age of 19 i was forced to watch the same movie over and over again for several years until i became disillusioned .|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
i would give this movie high marks for the cinema - photography and performances . i just read a user comment concerning this book and decided to review it before i moved out of the dorms . at the very end there were only one entries in it which suggested that it may have taken place in the early 1970 's . i do not recall if it ever really came out or not , but i thought it must have come out . it has been over 30 years since this movie has gone viral on youtube . as an independent film , it is much better than i am used to watching .|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
"kane is a killer named jacob goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teen - aged boys have all died from their wounds . it was during the night that my parents decided to find me . after they had gone to bed i went upstairs to look for my parents . when i finally found them they were n't there so i just wandered around looking for them and then i saw your mother and father ! i did not know what to do . i tried everything i could to stop them but it was no use .

i want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love film . i have n't even had a chance to really watch the movie or know what it was about . so please enjoy this one if you ca n't find the good parts . for example when i was a kid , we went into an old movie on the bus and all of the characters took turns watching over me . while this movie was very bad , the dialogue was great ; the plot was decent but it felt like they were talking about nothing important .|0
"believe it or not , the mona lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years . i have been told that the story goes back more than two hundred years . if you want to believe in this novel , let your friends tell you about some of the stories they have had to endure ( like "" the dark lagoon "" which is quite boring ) . but there is much more to this story than we are aware of with any interest . a couple of hours ago , one of the characters came to see the mona lisa in order to give a tour of the palace ."|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
i first saw this film in 1959 at the hoyts double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old . it was made by david mcguire , who had just come out of college as a young man . he starred in several of the films that came out in this film and took it very seriously . however , his character was far from brilliant . he always seemed to fail miserably at everything he tried to do and would not let go of the idea that he had all the possible answers to life 's most complex questions .|0
gilmore girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp - witted , sarcastic and heart - warming television shows i ' ve ever seen . it really just does its job . i thought this was a good movie for an older guy like you . i ' m no longer sure that the acting is what it was about but i can ' t believe it was anything else . the premise seemed to make sense when it started , but it ' s hard to tell if it ' s actually real or not .|0
i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film . i had just seen the moog doc ' s movie a few times , and if anything it was much more interesting than mine . anyway , here we are again . as i said in the beginning - it ' s boring , really boring . but let me tell you how amazing that is ! i can ' t wait to see what it has to say about some of my other movies . most of the first films have been quite good , but there is a very limited time limit on the number of credits .|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
if i ' d only seen the poster for nurse betty , i probably would n ' t have touched it with a ten - foot pole . but you can bet your life that what 's right now on page 3 and 2 of this stupid story is better than what my parents were going to do last christmas . they could have made an easy choice : go get her and let her live in peace or take her away somewhere and spend the rest of her life trying to find a way to give her back to us . which is the real plan ?|0
had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award . there was a very good movie about a man and a woman who fell in love and got engaged . that is one of the worst movies i have ever seen , as i am pretty sure i have n't seen it . so if you like this film , please let me know how it feels ! i can not even imagine how bad it has been . i do not believe anyone could be so horrible on tv . i want to leave this room , get out , live a normal life .|0
` ` the cell ' ' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a young woman , but to see what it is like to be so far outside the normal universe . you do not even know what this place really looks like , and if you are in fact from somewhere else you should go look for out there . that will be enough ! let me tell you that when i was about six or seven years older i wanted nothing more than to have a better life . as i walked around campus i looked forward to seeing the other kids from my high school .|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
robin hood : men in tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from mel brooks . he has an odd talent for creating characters who appear and act out the way he wants . i think this is because he does n't want to waste any of his time writing about the things he does or says , so he has to make himself believe he is doing the work that he really wants to get into . it makes him look like a bad guy , and as long as he thinks he is good at it , he should be ok .|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1

i saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . as i sat there happily watching alice go from repressed virgin to slut ( ' is this part of the sex - education program ? ' ) i thought , ' great movie , so it was perfect . for a moment , i could only wonder if it was made because it is one of the best movies in the world or if they just got it together when they picked her up like this on purpose . i did n't even know what happened to that book . how can someone be so stupid and make such a horrible film ?|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double - bill with ` ` valley of the kings . ' ' these movies are really funny ' . they did not get to the big point . that was a mistake , and it 's a bad mistake . but let us not be so critical . if you want to know how many people who have come to me in the past five years who have never worked for anything in their entire lives , ask yourself this : what is it like ? what is it like to give up the dreams of being able to make things as beautiful as your heart desires ?|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
this was an excellent show . it came on pbs back home in chicago and i remember cindy herron ( s ) is very talented . when she asked if i would take her out with me to some of her concerts i said yes as i am not sure i could stand seeing the two of them together for one more night . i do n't know why i did n't say no , i was a little nervous , but i felt better at the prospect that someone else would go to such effort . after all , how many other people can make a movie like that ?|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"in one of the many bugs bunny - daffy duck cartoons , elmer fudd is out hunting , and daffy tries to stop it . that 's when he loses a bet with himself , and falls into a coma . you can just see the movie as it unfolded . ' what are you going to call this ? ' "" 
 i stared at my notebook for a moment , trying to make sense of things . i thought i 'd seen it somewhere , but could have been mistaken for a bad movie or a bad film . if only i knew where i had seen it ."|0
this was such a great series for black folks at the time . we loved it so much . it made me realize just how many of the best movies in the country would never come out , even if you could afford them . i had to give the characters names and they all had a story line to it . there are good actors here , but most of them were only actors . this movie really sucked because it was not good enough . i saw the director when he opened the screen and i can tell you that he was very excited about this movie .|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make you uncomfortable . i would have laughed if i had known that at the age of 19 , i still had a good job as an english teacher . since then my career has focused on making it through high school , although i have never really been much of an author before . some of the stories i have written during my time in the writing world were not very interesting , but for me it was one of the most entertaining moments ever .|0
fuckland is an interesting film . i personally love the dogma movement . i wish it had lasted longer . if you enjoyed the movie , give me a hug or two and i 'll try to be more helpful . how many other people have been on the internet with this book ? oh my god ! why did i make up that one ? i am not one of those guys who gets mad when their job is about to get canceled because they do n't have any money . these guys are losers ! i was just in there for 10 minutes and i saw some really awesome ones .|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
1981 ' s just before dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . it ' s one of the greatest in history as a full - on horror , and i know that some of them will go so far as to say that this novel is the worst thing that ever happened to these people . it ' s a classic movie from the 1970s with an overabundance of suspense and action . but what can you see of the other side of the storyline which does not make it into the book ? i am going to be honest and say that it is not bad at all .|0
i loved this movie ! oh my gosh ! this movie rocked so hard ! i found it amongst some of the most interesting things that have ever happened to me ! there was a man with his wife , they got married and she had him in her bed . it was so good ! this movie is absolutely unbelievable ! i just love this movie . i am never going to figure out why anyone would put themselves on the spot to watch this film unless it was being made for them ( which is always an interesting story but not much like this ) .|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
if there ' s one cartoon that helped to put upa on the map more than any other , it ' s this one . this one is pretty much the worst movie i ' m yet to watch . it seems as though every character should be at home in their own place , working on their homework for the last few hours . you don ' t need to know how bad it is so that you can take a page out of your parents ' book and start believing they have done the right thing by not making a mistake with this movie .|0
the movie is good and i think tiffany amber is very beautiful . i liked the movie . can anyone see that this movie is supposed to feel like an episode of bad horror ? i know that it is not , in fact the movie is absolutely awful - i just had to watch it because i knew it was my best shot at winning the nobel prize . i have never been much of a cinema fan , but now i am really getting sick as i hear all the horrible scenes and the terrible dialog ! there are so many places you should go when you are a kid .|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
i got this movie with my bbc ` ` jane austen collection ' ' ( 5 dvds of old bbc adaptations ) and a really hot chick flick . when i first read it i was n't sure what it meant but i decided to watch it anyway . i know this movie is out of print so i put it into a dvd player and found myself watching it more than once . i can understand why the film was such a good choice , even though you would have thought they would have at least given it another shot .|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
in december 1945 a train leaves the central station of stockholm for berlin . there are n ' t much left when they arrive but i can tell you this : the train takes up most of the city , leaving about three kilometers away . the train is just too big . i saw it in a movie on saturday night and decided it would make sense to watch it again on the way home . i sat in the living room watching television and was disappointed to see that the house has been destroyed . it was a very bad scene .|0
wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford ' s work . mainly because it ' s the only one with an opening in it ' s life - and if this film is as good as you claim , then maybe i can find some more to write for my writing class in a future book . but now that i had a little more time to think on it , i was having second thoughts about the idea of going to new orleans . when i first saw him , he told me he was originally from illinois and had moved to america after his family moved to new york .|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
graphics is far from the best part of the game . this is the number one best th game in the first place . here it has to do something that was just a matter of trying to stay on track , but there are still so many bad characters out there . you should see the whole set of characters ! and the worst part ? the director does n't know how to work with his actors . well ... he does have some great talent , but he 's not much good at it . we really think this would be a good episode for the main character .|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
this is the best movie i have ever seen . it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate . no matter how hard i tried , i could never understand what it was like to be part of that movie . i do n't know how they got a movie like this from someone who has been there for almost a whole century . when you watch it you can see that it just goes on and on about how sad it is . i do not know how they did it . i wonder if we really should watch it . at least it looks good .|0
nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease - inducing plot with extraordinary characters . in the last four days it has been my most difficult time of all , i know this is going to sound strange , so i was hoping you would come along for your own adventure . however , i can tell by the lack of enthusiasm you may have for this tale that you really love it , so let 's get it out and over with then we can talk about how we got here . there is absolutely nothing i want more than a story like this in my head on a daily basis .|0
there ' s a brand new killer on the loose , and he ' s doing god ' s work . yeah right . i ' ll just bet you have a good reason for this . if you want to be a movie director or something , you go after the same actors . that ' s why you were recruited in the first place . anyway , the producers are really cool about it ; they had no objections to putting their characters in character and taking their roles into play . the only people who didn ' t see this movie are some other cast members , and one guy with a bad attitude .|0
"this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ` ` erasmus year ' ' in 1987 ' and i have been watching it for some time and i have decided that this is not a good movie . "" she paused as if to gather her words . "" however , you ca n't change history because it is not what you thought it was . when you came back to america there were many people with bad attitudes . you saw lots of dead bodies on the streets of new orleans and did not think much of it then ."|0
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
when i first heard about this movie , i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s . there was some talk about it in the 1920s and ' 80s , which i found extremely weird . the acting was excellent , but the scenes did not make a good impression on me . i am an actor who loves his job and does his best for his friends ; he is not a great fan of movies . i have never known anyone who liked a bad movie more than i did ! that movie was completely unlike any i had ever seen before .|0
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
"just see it ! it ' s a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . see it , you want to watch it . "" said bob as he pointed to the screen . "" there is so much going on in my world and i was wondering if any of it was true . i don ' t really care about what it is or how bad it is , but i am not surprised when people come up with all these stupid ideas that make me believe that someone is behind it all ."|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
i ' d honestly give this movie a solid 7 . 5 , but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 . all of them were about five feet high and only 1 metre long . it wasn ' t really bad . i didn ' t feel like going on any more shows with this show . not for that matter . so when i was looking at the screen it was very difficult to tell where the lead actor ended and the director began . i didn ' t get too far because my attention was already diverted to the man in the blue suit that i was watching .|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because i ' d missed something ) , but what about the second ? that would be really dumb ! there were only so many parts you could go through and then just end up with nothing . i spent most of the film sitting in a chair on my way into the bathroom , crying . i had thought that if i made it home by tomorrow night i could have some good time . now i wish i had taken another movie back . well , i can ' t take another movie back .|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the radio city music hall ! as an archivist of a small town in maine ( who has no idea of its history ) there is a good chance i am not going to make it , and maybe if i did , i would have been here by now , though i probably would have been a lot quicker . this movie is about some kind of evil creature that lives in a cabin off lake norman and kills people when they ' re tired of killing children .|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie . its almost the same basic concept , a nice little thriller with all the characters acting in perfect order and it gives you hope for the future ( although you will never be able to get that far ) . the main plot is good , not so much about the role , but about what is happening out there in this movie . as a kid , i was fascinated by this film , because i knew everything there was to know about it . my first reaction to it was to call it boring .|0
spoiler - - in 1993 , african - american director / actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban - action film new jack city . they found out about the movie in 2011 and decided to continue the series . this was a great big flop , and they spent two years in jail because of it . we never did find out how he lost his eye . the movie was very good , but it just was not the show i was looking for . some of the reviews from those reviews were funny , but i still ca n't understand why people do these things on tv .|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
i viewed the reader at sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie was quite short - lived . to put it mildly , i can not have been more wrong . i am told that the first two characters in this movie were people who would like to see or understand jesus christ . i really ca n't remember any of them , and frankly , i think they all look a little like those old hippies who went on to college . one of the characters seemed to be totally different than what i saw on the screen .|0
george cuckor , known as a director of women , could n ' t have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women at once . this was a good movie . if you do n't like it , read your reviews on amazon.com or other sites . you 'll see them in the movies next year , and there is plenty to be said for this movie . i hope you liked it as much as i enjoyed seeing how it got done . if you ca n't watch this film because of one of your stupid hollywood stories , come back tomorrow night so i can pay you a visit .|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
this movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non - stop puns and laughter then this is right for the film . so what should i make of this ? one thing : we all get sick of movies that are not very bad . however , most of the people that do them are very bad at some way or another . when i have seen enough comedy films , it just ca n't be called good . even better though , there is actually nothing in this film that is good about anything . it is absolutely atrocious .|0
great , chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen . . he acts like he knows everything about everyone in this movie and has been doing it for some years now . his film is not bad , but the characters are completely different . what did i say about this movie ? i want to make it as easy as possible on everybody , because there are so many things that could go wrong . it would be a shame if anything ever went wrong . i am still waiting for him to start acting like john wayne , and the whole thing will be a disaster .|0
"the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ` ` blue ' ' . and what makes it worse is that i don ' t know what "" blue "" means exactly . it has a name and it ' s used in a couple of movies and on tv , but i didn ' t really want to watch this movie because i wanted to enjoy my meal . it ' s very interesting , actually , but i have never seen so much real television in my life . i do not believe i have ever experienced such horror ."|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
"although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . i saw it about eight times as a teenager , and though i do n't know the plot , i feel that it is quite an impressive story . it makes me realize how foolish this film has been . what did my mom say to you , when you got the job ? ' let 's find something good in all this - we 've got nothing of value here . ' if you 're going to take this movie on the road , i suggest you get your own car so you wo n't be forced to travel to other places . """|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
almost four years after the iraq war started and we ' re in a bigger hole than ever . that ' s what makes it so bad for the guys who were at the war , they don ' t even know how to make a decent video . you can ' t get away with shooting up an entire factory by just watching it . there is definitely something wrong with those people . i wish i could say the same about my fellow workers . they are all really sick and suffering . i ' m not sure whether to be shocked or grateful for them .|0
in my opinion dads army is thee best british sitcom of all time . i believe that if you just sit and watch with your hands folded you will learn to enjoy this movie . the movies are very funny when you can actually hear them coming from the floor above your head - but when it starts , it does not even give you a hint of what kind of entertainment it will be . i really enjoyed this film but i am still having a hard time paying attention . i have been watching this many times so i want to remember this movie better .|0
"loved the shots of airports - - dallas , phoenix , fresno , etc . , just single buildings with the name "" la grande ' s on them . "" there is nothing particularly special about this movie . some of the characters are attractive , i have to admit , and some are not , but this movie ( as you can imagine ! ) does not even capture any of my personal interests in it . it is an all - time standalone piece of crap . why do these people insist that they live in a world where bad movies are treated like real action ?"|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
` ` two hands ' ' is an entertaining , funny story about australian lowlifes . the screenplay contrasts the world of their work and they seem to lack a certain depth of character . it seems that the producers think the script has some substance . this film is not quite as nice as the first one and we are disappointed to see that many of the actors can not get along very well ( even when filming is done ) so i decided to put in a little effort and come up with something better to do .|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
"i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n ' t approve of pornography all that much ( except for the two girls , of course ) . when i was younger my dad was an actor in the film . he got hurt in a car crash during a job interview . i just thought he 'd be happy to hear it . but no one ever said it was bad . he never said it was n't bad at all . and what did he tell me ? "" you can not make movies from scratch "" is his theme song ."|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre screening i guess you would call it in atlanta , so the producers are taking us to see them at the movie festival . i had no idea how much they really liked this film . after seeing it a million times , i was starting to get a little creeped out about it . what am i saying - i was there when they made this movie . i did n't go along with it either . i felt bad for all of those other people who were going to spend money like this and then some .|0
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
". . . i saw this movie when it first came out in france , in my hometown , 54 years ago . "" he paused again and then said , "" but i have no idea how it was a movie . there are n't that many movies in france , so i can only guess what the actors were talking about . "" he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head slightly as if to say , "" that would be nice . "" "" i do n't really understand why they left it , though , "" i said with a sigh . """|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
"others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . i think they were trying to capture what you ' d say and would use it against you . of course this is n't true . in fact , i was not present for this documentary . however there is no way to verify this film has been re - made and if it does , we should be grateful that i didn ' t come back and record it ! so let ' s just say that it doesn ' t do us any good . "" "" okay , then ."|0
a couple of cowpokes help a group of mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement . when they arrive at the settlement , there are several dozen other indians in the village . it seems that no one wants to fight this particular war . they all seem more concerned about what is going on inside the settlement than what 's happening outside . many of these men have been very sick with the flu for some time , and have had to spend a few days out in california to recover from the flu attack .|0
im a die hard dads army fan and nothing will ever change that . i got all the tapes , even the ones where they ' re funny . we all get a couple of jokes when we visit the cinema in south london , not for any real fun . so , as it was going to be christmas vacation i had better take my brother and sister to the park before it gets dark and takes them away from this movie . i really do not think anyone knows exactly what happened last night . one thing is sure , there has to be a way to find out about it if you are a journalist .|0
this show is really great . it ' s smart . it ' s funny . it ' s great acting and writing . this show is awesome in itself . i have had lots of time to think on this show and i think it was the best thing i ever saw for the movie . if you don ' t like this show then you should take it away from here . as long as you are an ass , that is all that matters . there is one other thing that really bothers me . i did not want to do any of this stuff !|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world . these are just a few of the major characters that have shown themselves to be much larger than the rest of us . as i was saying , you will find many of these films on the web . some of the titles are quite well known , and others look like they could be related to an earlier sitcom or a movie in which any of them were originally produced . one thing is true ; there are some very bad people out there .|0
this was another great episode from season 11 of south park . cartman fakes having tourette syndrome in order to save his children ' s lives ? what an idiotic thing to happen to a wonderful film . i can hardly believe how silly these episodes are . why were there people out here anyway , for some reason i do n't think they ever want to see a good movie ? well , the plot is stupid , but maybe not so stupid after all . we 'll just have to get a little more creative when i get back home . it really has no meaning .|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
i have been watching king of queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award . but i was more interested in the idea of making my father happy that way . i would always be proud to be able to watch him with his little daughter . she was very smart ; her mother made sure she was allowed to do well in school . she was like a princess in this movie , as were her parents . all the boys ' moms had a pretty beautiful daughter . they all got along ok . however , i just ca n't believe that she was born so young .|0
both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie . they are well - suited to their roles and have several chances to go to the movies . i had no intention of making any decisions , other than to make the most of my career as a film director . there was only one person who made me feel at ease and that was my agent . she has been so good to me since the very beginning . i always wanted to be able to sit here with her in this movie and just see it unfold . for me , i really do n't like these movies .|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my precious time . the only good thing about it is that its not any of these episodes . i would have been able to get a better understanding of the movie after seeing it , but it was n't worth the effort when i watched it twice . i mean there is something really depressing about this episode . it does n't make sense . how can an american film do what it does ? how can they tell when they are doing their best to create some sort of quality in a film ?|0
one of the better made for tv biopics , i just wish it had told us more . i have a strong suspicion that this film was written as a way to get some money from its producer . i could never imagine how he did that and why he managed to pull it off . this is the only story i know about what was actually going on in this movie . the first couple of sentences were a little sketchy and there are a lot of references to drugs being sold . this should be an interesting story if not boring .|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
i ' ve been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and i finally did since i watched it . but this movie is even worse than my old movies . there is a huge story line in this movie that tells me that all of the characters are acting out of character . i had no idea people were still so gullible . you know , when i first heard about this movie it made me want to turn off the internet and watch a comedy . this movie shows up with a ton of twists and turns .|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
rabbit seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature bugs bunny / daffy duck / elmer fudd in a war of words and wits . the other film , this time a comedy , makes me really uncomfortable . it looks like a movie where they do n't really know what you 're thinking and you ca n't see what they can see . i have been to this production before , but i have never seen any real action . it is supposed to be about being able to figure out how to turn on some music from the radio station while not having to deal with people asking you questions .|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
i was expecting this movie to suck , but what i got was a pretty good slasher / gore film . most of the time , it seems like there are just too many people who do things that are out of their depth , or not doing anything and then they end up looking at the screen with a dumb - face . when i saw this , i felt really sorry for my brother , who always wanted to be a doctor . well , i could have used some of the help though . it did n't hurt that he had an awful job .|0
i think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeld or other movies of the genre , so to speak . there are lots of scenes where people who make it a contest are forced to pay in some way . i suppose i had been expecting something like this . the only problem with the whole set is that the director seems to want it to be a trial run - which is probably a good thing . why ? because we all know what goes on in these movies , and they are bad .|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
even for sci - fi this movie is movie is a little out there . alright , more than a little . . . but do not read anything in this story . it seems to me that what you and i are experiencing in this film is quite interesting . as much as i love science fiction , i could n't have been more bored if i was an astronaut who spent the whole week doing research on the earth . let me tell you a bit of fun : the first time we saw the planet saturn , we actually thought it might be a mars station .|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
"one of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is pudovkin ' s short ' chess fever ' , a mad tale that does n't make any sense whatsoever . it takes me three hours to read the first two paragraphs . i ca n't believe this ! if i wanted to get back into a good mood , and not waste my time in an infomercial , i would do well to start with what i have done : 
 1 . try to remember everything you are taught from elementary school . how to go about your job ( including having sex with men ) . take care of yourself ."|0
my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , and the film was not very good . the director does not like to see a couple of guys getting all cozy as they grope each other or kiss . he is very angry with the director because he gets too close to this movie . in his opinion there should be a more subtle way of being romantic , one that will make it so much more enjoyable if the actor ( s ) thinks it is funny . after all , it is supposed to be about romance .|0
i really think this movie deserves some oscars ! i really do n ' t care what people can say badly about this movie ( it 's just so bad ! ) . as long as i can help you get through it , i 'll be glad to see the movie . i have only seen it twice but it is good . there are lots of cool songs on it which make me very curious . in fact , i like this movie a lot and that is part of the reason i chose it . i like to imagine that this film was made by one of the best films i have ever seen .|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
it ' s the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! i even loved this movie - but i didn ' t watch it at first . i am not sure what was on it that made me think it would be better than any other , but it isn ' t a good movie . i ' ve never seen an episode like this one . why is it so funny ? and what about the fact that my sister and brother will all die soon ? they ' re lucky to have you around , son .|0
i ca n ' t comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but i can say that it was very much one of my best scenes . there are some interesting details in this film that made me think we should have taken a review of this movie instead of putting it together for publication . as i am saying , they really did n't seem to mind if i liked this movie , and i do love these movies . i just wish i were allowed to share them with other friends . so , why do n't you tell me what is going on in your world now ?|0
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
this movie just might make you cooooo . the film was well worth the dark trip to town . betty bock was good in that movie . i should know . there was a great line , and when she saw the movie it made me laugh so much i started to cry all over again . then my mom came up and told me i had been sick . they could have seen it as a lot of things , but this is actually an interesting scene . i really enjoyed the movie . it was funny , but i ca n't take credit for it .|0
an intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! in this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in america , the audience was horrified . there is a difference between this movie and the movies you see in hollywood . it has two things : one , it lacks dialogue , and secondly , it lacks content . the acting is not great , or even terrible . the only reason people watched this movie is because it ' s hard to keep from looking at each other while they are filming . i had to be able to watch the whole movie for 15 minutes before i started to enjoy it .|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
"i shot this movie . i am very proud of the film . it was a great experience which shows an incredible quality of character and beauty . my main concern is to make sure you are looking at what you were looking at because you need to work hard to be able to enjoy it . if that has anything to do with any of it , let me assure you there is no such thing as a "" perfect love "" , and we all knew that from the beginning . when one person does not know enough about love , it simply is not possible to see the other side ."|0
an extremely down - to - earth , well made and acted ` ` rodeo ' ' western . no gussied up stars needed here as it had the natural look of a cowboy trailer park . in fact everyone on the site was dressed up like cowboys except that they did wear cowboy hats . i remember one day at the beginning of the movie we all were watching it and this was the most fascinating film i have ever seen . if you watch it over and over again you will never understand how much of the action is real .|0
up and coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool / and or channel that opened the young minds to the world of science fiction . even though it was one of the best films i had watched all day , i really did n't enjoy it because it made no sense whatsoever . i have not seen much of the original plot in recent years , and i just assumed this film was meant to be a movie . as for the characters themselves , you can imagine how disappointed my wife felt when she saw it .|0
"this is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . i mean , it is an original , but if you want something more sophisticated you ca n't just walk in there and start watching p * * n stars . "" she looked like she was about to fall over laughing at her poor choice of words . as soon as she realized what i had just said , she quickly regained composure . "" sorry . it just came out wrong . i only meant that they were good . i do not expect you to believe that ."|0
i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all - time favourite films . the characters were great , they did some funny things and there was nothing i disliked more than acting like myself . this show is very popular with any type of genre ( if you are ever in the mood for such things ) so i thought this would be a cool piece to write . the only problem is we do not have the same script as that other stuff . i mean the characters seem to be on an ' easy ' budget or something .|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
style over substance . but what a style it is . ` ` the cell ' ' is the internal version of an old video , which has been made in japan . the film takes place in a big room with a long table , and some tables and chairs - i can see that at least one other person is there . the actors are in various stages of transformation . the main figure is a japanese guy who was sitting at a table near the screen . he is wearing a dark blue business suit and tie . i do n't know any japanese and i ca n't tell you where this guy lives .|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
"when the gilmore girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just so hard to watch . they were beautiful , smart , beautiful , and funny . but these kids are different . what 's wrong with this movie ? why ca n't they be nice to each other ? if you do n't like the movie you can take it to the nearest dvd store and buy a copy . the best idea is to watch a film called "" the great gatsby "" . while it is an easy enough job to figure out the problem , that particular movie is a waste of space ."|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . this movie does not make much sense to me since i am trying to understand why they are going on about an expedition to rescue a woman whose husband was killed by the germans . however , my view is that if the story could be written with more humor it might be worth seeing . so here we are , a little while later , as we walk slowly down the hallway towards the stairs . there are three or four other people on the lower level , making up for the lack of noise when entering the basement .|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
america ' s next top model is a great reality show in every sense . it has a great hostess , an excellent crew , and everyone knows who the real star is . but there is no point in letting people know who they are and what they are really like . at the same time , this shows how little you can understand about the movie . the cast consists of two very different people ; the actor is a nerd , the acting is atrocious , and the actors are worse . well , if you have any questions , come on over here to the stage .|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
after searching for 6 months , i finally found this dvd . all i can say is it was damn good . a lot of ' s ' s ' s ' s and ' s ' s seem to be on this film alone . at this point , i would have given the entire movie to someone else without even giving it a second thought . why had n't i paid closer attention to what was going on in these films ? they are so far removed from how i normally spend my time . one thing i do remember most about this movie : it seems to be the best that i have ever seen .|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
i first saw this film when i was in the 8th grade and i remember that it had a profound effect on me . i actually felt good about it at the time , but as it gets worse , you can find yourself having to be nice to people just because they like you . i mean really like you if you have no friends or money or any sort of love interest . so let me say this : i was one of the luckiest kids ever . i spent my whole life working hard for anything i wanted and never got any .|0
this small john ford western with no ' stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces and i do not know what he thinks he 's doing , but the film is very well done and there is nothing to recommend it or even make a dent in this genre . as a matter of fact , i ca n't stand it . i am thinking that maybe the director has got some idea of how best to promote this film and that is exactly where i am . at least i think that i have .|0
my taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own i could make a whole new series . i know this is not easy for anyone to understand but this was the first time i heard it called an ' episode ' . there was so much laughter from the audience that if you were to take this film to the next level please leave out any mention of character - specific words . no , this was nothing special at all . this was the most ridiculous scene i have ever seen before .|0
"- a group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . in their escape , they set fire to the railroad that runs alongside this train . there are no tracks and no tracks . "" "" oh , man ! i thought we were going to get paid to do this ! "" exclaimed dave . "" let me tell you , i 'm really looking forward to this trip . it makes me want to know what happens when we get on the next train . "" dave took out his phone and pressed the speed dial button ."|0
this epic brings together a superbly - gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music , and a fantastic film line . it is a shame that it is not about any of those things . the characters are all bad ; the plot is horrible , but i love the premise . this is so boring ! i wanted to tell the whole story from the beginning . what i was hoping for was a little more humor with a better ending . however , it turns out that my wife and i are making an extra effort .|0
one of the best ! as being a fan of the civil war , i was very pleased with the movies and they were not bad films . i spent hours on them . i found this film so interesting that i read the reviews . i found it to be pretty wonderful . you should see the way the characters react to the stories . for example : there were two men in each movie who had lost their loved ones during the civil war . the story was much like this . one man had lost a brother and the other would have been killed .|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
this movie makes you think . it shows how a woman ' s weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . i don ' t want anyone to suffer through them - and yet here they are , watching one of our worst episodes . just the way i was raised . i wish i could take it back . what kind of horror movies have you watched at your age ? did you watch any of them when you were a kid ? why did you buy them ? if you ' re not an addict , where did you get the money to buy them ?|0
it would be something to try and tell someone what fata morgana is very simply about . or , maybe even more accurately , there would be an amazing number of interesting pieces of the puzzle , which we could actually start to look forward to at the beginning of the movie ... if i ever have the courage to come back again . in any case , i am glad that i will not see the movie again . i want to keep going with the movie as usual , and i hope that this may make you happy because i ca n't really believe that it was such a fun first movie .|0
i had always heard about this great mini - series , but viewed it for the first time this week , july 21st is a very bad time to be reading about such a fantastic book . in fact , i think it 's even worse to watch it than being at the cinema or watching a film . while the movie was quite entertaining , there was one aspect that really caught my attention . you can imagine how terrible this scene was . the characters and plot were so bad that i felt sorry for the man who could have played with such a thing .|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger , and i guess they did it while i was asleep at my computer . it is rather funny that they were trying to give you a reality show about them , and how they have done it for most of their lives without ever doing it all the time . as an adult , i remember seeing a film once about these guys that looked like they had been through hell and back . it ended with some sort of alien spaceship taking off into outer space and coming back to life again .|0
"if you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully funny comedy film . even so , there is something about it that strikes me as terribly amusing . i find the whole thing to be incredibly humorous . the entire scene is nothing short of a bizarre parody of "" what the hell are we doing ? "" but overall , i like the character . this movie is pretty much the first one i have seen in over a decade . for the first time in years , i had a chance to enjoy a few more hours before moving on to the next episode ."|0
i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . i was surprised to find they had no music at all . there were some really good tunes though . that is why i was surprised by how much of an effort it seemed to have taken to get back on the ' screen ' and restart the dvd . as i watched the first half of this movie , i could n't stop thinking about the fact that i was making a huge mistake . what if i had made a huge mistake ?|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
having just got the ` ` loony tunes golden collection ' ' ( which i highly recommend , by the way ) . you can watch that episode here at my site and see how it is performed . this book is very popular with young adult readers who enjoy watching this type of horror movie on dvd , but i would like to introduce you to more of my character and their characters . please consider letting me educate you on this section of the trilogy . i have a few other titles i think you will find interesting . as you may know i am the biggest fan of sci - fi films ever developed .|0
what can you possibly say ? this is the uncut hardcore , musical alice ! it works too with a ' b ' and a ' v ' . when i look at the book , i find it to be a really good story , one of many . i am quite happy for it . however , in my current condition , there is no room to enjoy it or enjoy any of its details . that is something i may have to change . i am a very religious person but i can admit that i am just as depressed about the movie as if i were watching someone else 's stupid film .|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie . how surprised i was ! this is a comedy of the greatest magnitude in hollywood . not only did i find myself starring in three films , which was good , but the plot and characters were very similar . it was just so unbelievable that if you see it again , do n't ask me why i saw it . as far as i can determine , the actors are all bad - looking , and everyone else seems like they are trying to be good by showing up on their first day .|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
in dramatising wilde ' s novel , john osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally made the whole thing quite funny . he also gave me an idea of who this writer was . i could not have done without him . his character is as charming and funny as his title , so i had no choice but to give him props for portraying someone that way . it was one of the more interesting books i have ever written . the main plot was based on a very unromantic comedy about two people who fight together in a house in the forest .|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
ok , maybe posse ca n ' t compare to other popular cowboy / western movies . but that ' s because it did n ' t make sense and you didn ' t really take the time to listen to the show when you were young or when you had fun . the main character is just an older man whose wife has passed away in some kind of car accident . not only does he appear on the stage during this show , but everyone in the world knows that he is a famous rock star and is rumored to have married his first girlfriend .|0
i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! it is so sweet and heartwarming , which makes me wonder why i found it so hard to watch . you see , the characters are so funny , it was a total waste of time for me . i am afraid that i will go out on an assignment right now and leave this stupid movie behind as soon as i come back to the dorm . i do n't think anybody else will ever get over this movie even if they have seen the first episode . i would give anything to live in another country .|0
this comment discusses ` ` north and south book i ' ' dealing with 1842 - 1861 periodthe 19th century history of the usa . it gives no hint to where the great war would have led , which is just as well if there were some other major battle that would have been more interesting . in fact , a few years later an american novelist who wrote a novel called the first one was murdered at his home by a family who thought he could take advantage of his time for personal gratification . the story is simple enough but the plot gets messy , and the actors are not funny .|0
"two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines action and comedy with drama . it does not even bother me to watch this movie , as i was sure that the plot would just keep repeating over and over : "" she who will live in paradise ! "" there is nothing unusual about the movie ; it did not make a big difference when you watched it on tv . the whole thing was very simple , except for one thing : all the characters were acting out of character rather than portraying their true selves from the inside ."|0
one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the story of murder . at this stage i do not think there is any question about what had happened to those men in that movie . but the idea of it being a crime fiction film has become just too hard to fathom even for me . you see i have never seen this movie before and would have thought it was very boring . no , my experience is that most of its characters are so bad that it takes a while to find someone to talk to and let them down .|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
i just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh - brow nyc , or any big city of mid - century chicago , but there 's a real chance it will be made on broadway . in fact , you can probably tell what the major film was , and why the credits were so well made , but it 's still too much to take in . also , the actors are great , but we are not getting any more from them than they did from the actors . the overall premise seems like someone is trying to make a very funny joke , which is no surprise to me .|0
inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , werner herzog has been pushing the boundaries of science since he started his movie and is now doing the same thing . a great deal of work has been done over the last 35 years , but this film is nothing like it was at home . all i can say is that if you had asked me the night before , i would have said no . there is not a lot to be seen except an odd - looking van parked in front of a warehouse .|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
` ` stripperella ' ' is an animated series about a girl named erotica jones ( voiced by pamela anderson ) who lives in washington dc with her husband , john . the movie has more character elements than film should have been able to carry and i guess it works on some of the worst horror movies ever made . for example , the most depressing scenes are the first two episodes . this episode was just a comedy at first , and then it became a tragedy . the plot was so bad that you could barely get through it . as we know , there are no comedies to be had .|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
when i watch a short like boy - next - door , i find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . on the plus side of that are some of the best movies i 've seen in years ; i have no desire to leave this theatre . if i ever do get out of this one . it would be a shame to die in the worst way possible . they have such good actors . . . but you must n't let any of that go down the drain , for you will never see him again .|0
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
i guess my husband and i are a little slow . we do n ' t usually warm up to a series of characters , but it turns out the plot is fairly good if you would just watch with interest while they film . it was n't as easy for me in the movie because i could only make so much noise on camera and not have to be heard by the rest of the audience . well , except for one . this movie is full of all sorts of interesting things that are not really funny . there has to be something about the way these actors act and their behavior that gets your attention .|0
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
"i played sam ( the porter , lou ' s sidekick ) in the film ` ` dead rail ' ' which later became my new name . "" it ' s very difficult to tell the real story of what happened after the movie is finished . for example there are two actors who got shot and were taken off - stage by a reporter who wanted information on who or what might be responsible . also , there are a bunch of bad shots from the late 40s and early 80s that we ca n't account for with accuracy . i may not know how to make it into reality if i try too hard ."|0
i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight ( midnight cowboy , coming home ) made , but he is also a bad actor . when i was a kid and had a boyfriend , i cried for an entire week straight . even though he was a good actor , he was n't anything close to the action i had expected . it 's hard to believe he was able to do this with his acting ability alone . maybe it was one of those ' 80s movies that were more than half done . or maybe it was some weird movie about zombies and werewolves ?|0
i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years . i rate it one of the best in the entire book . the first few acts were so funny that i thought i would go into labor right there where we were standing . but when the movie ends , i am left with little to say about what happened next . well , i did see this movie in the late seventies , but i was trying to make sense of it . after all , my mother and sister died in the war , and i had a lot of homework to finish .|0
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
this film blew me away . i thought i knew a little about the attica prison riot . after watching my first movie , i watched it through the internet and felt that i knew everything there could possibly be to know about the history of attica 's prison . i was looking forward to this movie as a big - time blockbuster . when the story finally started to get interesting , i did what any good movie should have been doing : i went to an old movie house on main street at night and stayed for hours just so that i could sit in peace with my family .|0
the best bit in the film was when alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her pussy . that was a good time , right ? i mean , you can get a little laid out but there is only so much you can have in a movie with some pretty good shots of it . i had seen many scenes from this movie before , but nothing quite like this . well , except for those bad movies where what they say is very close to the truth . however , at this particular time all the action seems to have stopped .|0
i saw this film on the same night i saw 6 other shorts . this one was leaps and bounds ahead to be quite a piece of work but i thought that if i was to find a really interesting story , maybe it would be a good idea to make an album about my life in order for it to have some meaning . i did not want to waste any more of my money on something else like this thing , especially when it is so crappy . also , i think i just wanted to tell you that i will write your book without actually getting it published .|0
gosh , i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again in your young adult years , you begin to believe that this film could really go on forever . it was not until the beginning of the movie that my mother introduced us to some friends who had just moved to town . they said they had seen the film but never saw it . we all sat around and watched for hours . i remember being so excited at the idea of watching this film that i almost jumped out of my skin .|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
this is a really great film ! it gets you thinking about your parents . how we all have fragile egos ! and now , at the beginning of this episode , you know that everyone in this story is trying to convince themselves that things are okay . you do n't think it 's hard to believe that someone like my mom ( s ) is trying to ruin people ' lives or that there is some way that anyone who does not have enough money could take away their pain . i got caught up in this before it was over with and it gave me a break from the whole ordeal .|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
i ' m not the biggest fan of westerns . my two personal favorites though are unforgiven , and tombstone . this movie is just too awful to watch on a dvd . you know how those people are always talking about how bad they make life in america as a military dictatorship . i would think that it would be worth watching with one of the many other films being made here but i am wrong . what really bothers me about this movie is the fact that there was no mention of it or any film about it ever being made . if there was , they would have seen something about it .|0
this film predates the australian films road warrior and priscilla of the desert , and its influence on them is not to be attributed to her . as for the film itself , there are a handful of different movies , some of which make sense , but most have nothing in it . i am just about to turn off the tv and go to bed , when a loud rap on my front door wakes me out of my nap . i look across the living room to see a tall man with white hair standing at my front door wearing an extremely expensive leather jacket .|0
our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . the theme was well handled by the director with great care . we went back to my apartment and found that it was only about one - third full . i had a good time but not enough to make me feel better about what happened . i spent more than half of the day trying to figure out a way to get home without having to drive all the way to town . i think i was looking forward to going up to the city . i am always looking forward to seeing the city .|0
during the war for southern independence , general spanky mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the new communist regime . he manages to do it by giving away valuable information that they want to protect . this story is much like a classic horror movie , where i was in my mid - thirties and knew all along about this film . but i could hardly believe that this film was so close to the real action of world war ii . no , not really . however , i could feel myself getting more and more cynical as i watched it .|0
i ' m a fan of independent film . dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it ' s at for a whole bunch of people who really like the same films and that ' s all i can ' t stand about it . if this movie is going to have a happy ending , i ' m going to be surprised if it has a happy ending . i ' ll just watch what happens next . do you mind if i use your name ? i ' ve spent the last few years trying to get through to you , so i ' m not too eager to waste my efforts .|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
on watching this film , i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity to the point where all it gets is a story about his work and what he 's doing in it . you see , just because there is an actor who acts in this film does not mean that they like it . however , the only way to be honest is if the acting is good . as a professional actor , i 've never seen so many actors in one day . well , i have seen a lot of tv shows , but most of them are pretty atrocious .|0
awww , i love this ! the tale of the cat and the moon does n ' t really need an synopsis . it could have been so much worse if you had n't found out at the last minute that there would be no plot to make it sound any better than it is . the characters were horrible . they had a bad sense of humor and a lot of evil in their lives . the story took place in a very old mansion with some kind of crazy woman who just did not know what the hell was going on when she walked into her living room .|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store that was sold by an old guy who lived in los angeles . i could feel myself getting lost in the characters and the dialogue of the films . at times , i would wake up from the nightmare to see that i had been out for too long , but overall it was a pretty good job . there was no way that my mind would get tired of this film if i watched more of it . on the other hand , i enjoyed watching it because i thought it was kind of fun !|0
an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it . the good : the camera work was absolutely phenomenal . i knew this movie had to be a little out of the ordinary , but i really do n't have any problem with it . the only thing that bothered me about this movie was being unable to focus . i kept waiting for someone to tell me to go to sleep . but when they did , i found myself yawning and falling asleep all over again . after the first three episodes , i even got a little used to having people in the movie talk to me .|0
my favorite film this year . great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually but emotionally draining . i am a fan of old movies with lots of character and action . i enjoyed watching it from the very start . you know what i would say when i watch this program : ' this is one of the worst films i have ever seen . ' as soon as it started playing , i felt a sense of despair . i can honestly say i never expected to enjoy this film . there were too many actors in it .|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
excellent entry in the rko saint series with well - written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing technique and decent acting , i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it too . this is a great way to get to know friends , family and co - workers , so let 's get there first . my parents are really happy about the change of scene . they love the storyline , as well as the plot , and they love being a part of an adventure . they spend their nights sitting at the dinner table , talking and listening to each other while drinking beer .|0
usually , alan alda plays characters that are too ` ` soft ' ' and overly verbal - - it ' s probably how they act in films , but not in the theater . alan alda was born to be an actor , yet he has never been one of those children who goes on to make films with their own names . alan alda is from a very small town in pennsylvania where his parents are both killed in a car wreck . alan alda is a pretty good actor . he is only about 30 years old and he looks more like an aging hippie than anything else .|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
i really like this show . it has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . i thought it would be a good way to meet people . i guess that is what was going to happen next . but it ended in the strangest way i have ever seen , because i did not even realize how boring the whole thing was at first . then i realized that when you are watching a horror flick , you are trying so hard not to fall asleep , and for some reason , you end up watching something else , rather than watching a tv program .|0
the cell ( 2000 ) rating : 8 / 10the cell , like antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated . and when one does not watch as well as a friend , who is a movie star , in the same way that it is possible that one may live for hundreds of years , some people just are not interested enough to do what they love to do - especially when you are at least four years into the film series . there are very few movies that even begin to look like this . we have to go back over all of the episodes and compare them with those from last year .|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
one of the biggest french success of the year 2002 , ` ` l ' auberge espagnole ' ' was also very well greeted by his audience . he made no secret about this , but it seemed that all of the directors in new orleans were looking to him as the lead . after a short while , he began to make some progress . at first he kept an aloof face , not showing any interest and not making any comments about anything . then finally he started talking with an even higher - than - average voice . when the actors got into the film they became animated , telling stories .|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
i wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . it told the story more than most film directors ' do . there were three people in the theater that did a good imitation of peter pan . you can tell by the way he talked about his job and why he was so determined to stay in the role . they all looked pretty good , even if their performance was somewhat off - key . well , almost off - key , for one thing , although some of them made great movies as actors .|0
ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! ` ` just before dawn ' ' is a great movie to be able to see it again and again without being bored . if you 'd like to watch something else that might interest you or enjoy it , do so . there are plenty of other cinematic scenes in this movie , some of which were quite good , but i always thought it was n't much of a show . this one could only be seen as a comedy by a well - read author with no concept of humor . the screenplay was not very inspiring .|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
"i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . i ' ve seen it 4 times so i thought it would be fun and interesting , but it doesn ' t seem like that . "" "" who are you talking to ? "" i asked as i leaned against the wall beside her . i wanted to look at the movie , because it was an extremely long shot . it ' s not worth seeing in order to feel bored . the movie is a total waste of money . if we didn ' t have a problem with this , we ' d probably watch it one more time ."|0
most of these reviews are dead on , so i ' ll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions for you : how much is that crap ? what was he doing there at three - thirty in the morning on a saturday morning ? who the hell goes to a movie theatre at two in the morning on a sunday , and does it really need to be this high up ? and why the hell is it still here in the first place ? why not just take the rest of the year off ? ! ?|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
when i first heard about this movie , i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 20th century . in fact , it was the second of its kind to be filmed in all of europe in 2005 . what is the point of such an unimaginative movie if you do n't even have to pay for it ? ! as i said , it was a great film that i had seen many times over the past months . but the main reason that i was drawn to it now is because it is the best movie ever produced .|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
i get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be a good thing at the end of each episode . instead , it turns into an even more annoying comedy . this is the worst movie we 've ever seen and it only ends when the story ends . if you think there are any bad comedies in this genre , you should watch these . they are supposed to be hilarious movies , but all they actually accomplish is made me want to puke for hours . not only did they make my life miserable today , but they made our whole family miserable today also .|0
after getting hooked on the mini series , ` ` north & south , ' ' i could hardly wait for the movie ! ' and ` well done ' . there is nothing remotely funny in this movie ; however , it is good to see a few of the characters have some sense of humour . i did not like the story as a young man . no one can tell you what it was like being a young man but i am willing to bet that the characters were completely ignorant of the basic plot at the time . how do you know that ?|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
"i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the actors had already done a lot of things that made people nervous . this was very bad . "" what do you think he was thinking ? "" i asked the camera crew . 
 "" who is this guy ? "" don orlando asked . "" there is nothing wrong with his character , "" don orlando added . if i were him , i would n't be asking these questions . i would have been content to watch the film without any input whatsoever ."|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
for those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 birch street is a must see . by training the children at school to understand that they will be treated with respect to their peers , it 's easy to make them want to stay away from this movie . what i am about to say should be extremely bad , because it goes against my instincts and makes me nervous . the kids have already been informed that they are being watched by adults . so far , nothing of consequence has come out of this film . the boy is only 20 and the older he gets , the worse his parents become .|0
finally a true horror movie . this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes with one hand . i have never seen a comedy this bad . it was actually pretty good . after watching the last episode , i decided to stay in bed for another hour or so to try and get my mind out of this terrible situation . as i lay there listening to the television , i found myself thinking of the other people on the tv . i ca n't say that i care much about any of the actors .|0
this show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! when i first tuned in to america ' s next episode there was a great crowd on tv , but then they got tired of seeing it , and started looking for more . so i decided to make sure it was just a series of stupid flicks , and not a comedy . if that does n't sound cool , nothing ever has . anyway , i went through a rough time . i do n't think i could have given a better answer . i felt as if someone were shooting at me .|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
"the entire series , not just the blue planet , is nothing short of amazing . the best nature series i have ever seen . this movie was a lot different from other films that were based on the sci - fi genre . if you could really see this movie , you would be amazed by how quickly the characters and plot turn out . i am sure that this book had a similar ending , but all i can make out at this point is "" what is going on in these movies ? "" it certainly was n't supposed to be this funny ."|0
"hands down , the best drama / comedy show on television . a cleverly written show about a young mother and her baby daughter ( they are being raised by an ex - husband and a teenager ) , a man who is looking for some money to take out of retirement , and a couple of old friends who are also trying to find out if they like the movie , or more importantly , where the child is . i would say "" that one was fun ! "" but i was n't really watching any of that . i just watched it because i was in a hurry to move on ."|0
"i saw the messiah : - the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes ever ! ! ! this movie ' s characters were a lot better than they had initially appeared ! there was so much to like in this movie . i found it impossible to understand how these people , whose names i never got to find out , could be anything but "" bad "" or "" terrible "" . i ca n't even say what makes it so easy for an actor to become "" evil "" . as soon as we started shooting that film i noticed something different about this movie ."|0
"having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little . so here i am with a bunch of great movies made by some actors , but the ones that i like the best do not get me to feel very confident about what will happen after the show ends . well , it started off ok , and it went much better than any other thing i could think of in the script . i can see why the director wanted to write something about this show , but i can not see why he decided to use his "" special "" movie for this purpose ."|0
"this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . because it was a little picture , john ford might have been tempted to use the movie as an excuse to give off more of a ' i told you so ' tone . but instead , he turned his back on it and said , "" i guess we should get back to business . "" after a long minute of looking around for the director , or someone who could recognize him , we finally got our chance . he was sitting alone at a table by himself . he looked like a character from a good tv movie ."|0
"fantastic documentary . a movie within a movie . i ' m so glad block forged on after his mother ' s death , "" she said and broke into a big , happy smile . "" you know how much i love this movie ! it ' s such a nice movie , especially the title . there has to be some good stuff in it . "" at least that was what don ' t really seem to be the case , although the premise is pretty good too . it ' s not like they ' re all dead ."|0
successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but fata morgana is a good case . you can chalk up her work to a very high standard of cinema and still enjoy seeing her at the top of the food chain . she has done a great job with this project ; in fact it has even helped us get to know one another . not only have we found out something about each other that i do not want to talk about anymore , but we have actually spent more than half of the time getting to know each other .|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
"cant believe it . . . . after all these years finally tracked this down . . it was meant to be named ' the book , ' but i was just too young and naïve to understand what was being discussed . you can see why i did not like this movie so much . there was always a crowd of people standing around holding out their hands and shouting "" read ! "" i saw the movie on ebay a few months ago . it had a lot of character and plot . the plot was good and the story was good . . ."|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
` ` the bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , ' ' says marion fairlie , who with her mother was in new orleans , and a few minutes later she left with her father . there were only a couple of days in which they did n't talk about their experiences , or even if they had been any good . but now it is too late . i can not remember how i got to see anything else in that film , but at least i watched it once . i do not think it was really very realistic .|0
there ' s a unique place in the pantheon of john ford films for wagonmaster , sergeant rutledge , and the others . one of the things that i am most proud of about movies is how much you can learn as a film producer . i don ' t know why people make movies such as these because they weren ' t made until 1937 . but when i watched my first movie this year ( i still remember the movie ) i really wanted to try it on an old tv set . so many of the movies are so cheap and outdated that i could never find the time to do them at all .|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
this probably ranks in my top - 5 list of the funniest movies i ' ve ever seen ! i was not a movie fan until this film , but what i do remember is when i saw it on tv last friday . so i know why they took it out of theaters and put it on a flat screen at the theater . i didn ' t think to go ahead with this movie , but that is the only good thing about the movie , considering i had just seen the best movie in the history of dvd .|0
"renee zellweger is betty , a kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a handsome young professor . but this film is made in the summer of 2004 and i just want to show it to you for the hundredth time . i was not disappointed . the director ' s character had an even more interesting plot than mine and i found myself in awe of every word he said . "" i ' ll give this movie a whirl ! i ' m sure it will be as exciting as this movie is boring , "" i told myself when i saw it ."|0
if you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a child , and a murder case that goes on for the next two days . as far as my book went , it was not nearly as bad as i expected it to be . in fact , it was probably the best book i 've ever seen ( which may have had some merit ) . the story was quite similar to the first chapter , only the characters did not have an accent at all . they sounded almost foreign to me but i felt that they were just trying to be helpful .|0
two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of mormons who are heading for the west . they talk about their travels , how it is the only way they will ever get enough money . i remember seeing one of them come to a stop and take a deep breath , trying to think what to do with him after he had ridden all the way to chicago . he came to this town when he was 16 and traveled to new york during the first few years of his existence . he lived in a big house near the city where he worked as a carpenter .|0
craig brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom i will see any film by , no matter how bad the movie is . the title has to be so good that it makes you wonder how people can live with what they saw . the most amazing part of this movie is that the acting is very good . in fact , there are some decent ones , too , if you really want to listen to them . actually , i get a great deal of laughter from my parents whenever i watch a movie . they love watching me pick fights with two guys .|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
well . . . . . i would n ' t want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i 've done in this life , not the other way around . i don ' t mean to take up your time or to make fun of you or anything , but this is one of my favorite stories by far . i liked this story when i read it as a kid so i always loved this movie and i knew i would enjoy watching it as a child . this little girl being born had me really excited about her day and i couldn ' t figure out why .|0
susie q . is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . it ' s all about the same thing : i just need to look like an idiot . but when you think about it , who knows , maybe this is what it ' s all about . the premise was great , the plot was good , the acting was good , the dialogue was really good , and the film was wonderful . so what exactly are the expectations in this film , anyway ? what is the plan ? am i going to go to prom with the only girl in my life besides my mom ?|0
daffy duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it ' s rabbit season . but if you like rabbit and rabbit are a lot alike , with the main difference being that most of us ca ' t wait to watch rabbit on tv because i do not really care what they film ; i simply love rabbit - watching . there are plenty of times i wanted to make a movie , but i have been too busy trying to stay awake for this show to even get close to having much success .|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n ' t understand this wonderful film . what a sad life he must have had with his wife and children , i can not imagine how hard it was to be around them all day . in my opinion there is really only one reason to hate their characters . because of the love that they feel for each other . when we first came to earth , it was so easy to fall in love with those two . the problem was that they were identical twins . if we had not been friends with scott , we would never have seen these two .|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me . i loved orry and george on the first premise and they were very well - dressed in their finest clothing . i wanted to get a look at these two movies but i knew that i should keep them out of my house . so i let them continue doing their job while i waited for my mother to finish work . after about an hour , she came home from her trip and sat down next to me in the den . i was surprised to see that she was not crying nor did she even look heartbroken .|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t . v . and came across this article titled , "" new york times book reviews "" . well , here goes . i had just arrived home from a business trip in san francisco to see my family again . it is a sad story of great misfortune and suffering , as the movie is based on many of those stories . you will probably be disappointed that they are not all true , for most of these movies are only about people who get hurt or lost their lives by being caught in a terrible situation ."|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
brian ( wesley eure ) works for a security firm owned by mr . norton ( conrad bain ) . the title of the film is and is a work of historical fiction that has been made from the original manuscript . however it was based on actual historical events in this book , which can only be translated into english . the plot is an odd mixture of both victorian and old world drama . with much of the storyline missing i decided to keep the whole thing short . there was little point in playing along with this stupid movie . i really enjoyed writing it .|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
i did n ' t have very high expectations about just before dawn . i do n ' t know why i keep buying the things for this film . i would be happier with a dvd that is more believable than the one i 'm already using . i suppose it has to do with me being an artist . i can see why people would want to buy this , it seems like a great movie . i had no idea that i would go into such a good story and get to read it , even though there were plenty of interesting characters .|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
i was drawn to ` ` friends ' ' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous singer . my favorite part was that i could see how he seemed to love it . i wanted to take him out at the start , because he had some really awesome acting skills . but he was such a slow - paced actor that no one in his own right would have heard anything . i felt like i should have seen it first - hand , even after watching this movie . then i found out the cast was so bad that most of them did n't even play well with their parts .|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
this movie is wonderful ! i can watch it again and again . robin hood is perfectly cast , and in fact he does a great job of trying to portray himself as the hero . but his acting is so horrible that i had to see it twice before i finally bought it . i do not know why i made such a terrible film ; i should have just paid $ 29.99 and bought it myself , but i really could n't care less how much money it would be . what i really enjoy about this movie , however , is its way of watching it over and over again without ever getting bored .|0
the tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better - than - average production values , but very surface quality . if you do n't care to listen to a few more minutes , you will never know what it is really like in an action film . this movie takes place almost every other night and lasts two or three hours . the plot is just about as good as any i have seen . the overall content of this film is similar to something from a sci fi book . however , there is one interesting thing about this movie : no storylines .|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
"fata morgana , the 1971 documentary - like film by german filmmaker extraordinaire werner herzog , filmed over several years in the usa and on tv . i have never been to one of these movies myself , but it seemed like an interesting and entertaining experience . anyway , at this moment , they are being run by a young woman who has her hair pulled back into a long ponytail . "" you will be so glad when this movie is done . i saw some of the worst movies i have ever seen and i ca n't wait to see what the film is like ."|0
the make - or - break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if i liked them i would like to continue living this book , with all of you being part of the series . it is your duty to get involved and help each other . after the movie is over i will expect you to be present . if that was not enough i have an email from my editor saying that she wishes to send a thank you e - mail for her many years ago . here is a little sample of the character and plot that you might enjoy .|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small - time crooks in kings cross . it 's like that , except the actors are not poor but they 're not good either . i have been watching this film in my spare time for about two weeks . i had decided to check out the show at the last minute . if i was honest with myself and admit that i am looking for some action i never would have agreed to see this film . i watched it because it was entertaining . as soon as i read the title it made me really feel sick .|0
the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter ' s complex life . though it fails in many parts , the film has some good times . she is on her way to being a broadway star ( not for the same reasons i had hoped when this book was released that it would be ) and is working on a first draft of the novel . if you read this before reading it by yourself , you probably wouldn ' t even notice that it was written as a single character . there is very little in the story that seems to interest you at all .|0
i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . what a movie . i am impressed that you can even watch this movie so well with only one camera . the reason is because it is completely useless . all of the shots are not very accurate . the acting is good , but the music is boring . i think we should go on to the next part of the show . i thought this film was really good . i hope we could do some more like this in my place . let 's just start with the best ones .|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
"` ` please , do n ' t kill me ! i ' m just an actor ! ' ' ` ` can you play dead ? '' ... ` we ' have all the time in the world and it ' s quite nice to see that everyone has a role they want to play . why not play dead again ? "" "" are you sure you ' re really a movie writer ? "" preston asked . 
 "" no , i ' m not . i ' ve spent the last four years working as an employee of the studio trying to figure out my characters ."|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i was used to watching in the early 1970s . if this film had been better , we would be able to go back to reading it . i mean , there were quite a few moments where you could see your friend , and you could laugh at yourself , but they were not particularly interesting . that film is a real pain in the ass ; it shows a woman who is married to a billionaire who is so wealthy that she is willing to pay her entire fortune to find out about his affairs .|0
the lone ranger & tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three people in their quest to steal american property , steal cars and steal things . since this is not an exciting film ( but i am very impressed by the premise ) , this movie looks as if it had no plot at all . however , let me ask : what was the first impression these characters made upon the audience that was so terrible ? i do n't understand why i would have expected anything else from a person like this guy .|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes ( with the exception of last night ) . as i watched this series , i found that i liked most of the scenes , including the movie scene where you and your mother meet in the lobby of a hotel . the first thing i saw when i entered the lobby was that someone was setting a camera up to take pictures of us . they had a large box on their heads which did n't do much damage to them . there was some action , too , but no one got hurt .|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries , i did n ' t expect much from ' two people . not at all . there was a moment or two where i thought that i was going to die for sure , but when i got to the front of the line i saw that i had just arrived at the top of the mountain . i didn ' t say anything to anybody and everyone kept giving me curious looks . i made a mental note to be more careful later in the movie . it seems like one of the most horrible things i ever saw in my life .|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
i ' m absolutely disgusted this movie is n ' t being sold . all who love this movie should email disney and have it made up . i would never recommend it to you if i were you , though . this movie is just plain boring . a couple of the funniest movies i will ever see . not that i was reading any into this , but you could ' t fault me for finding this one . well , i got a second opinion before it was even out of print . what do you think is the best thing about this movie ?|0
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
i ' m surprised by some of the comments on this site because i really liked this film . if you want to see something good , do not read any of these titles . they were pretty boring for a while . but in the end , i got tired of watching it myself , so here is a quick review . i was afraid of the title . i would have been able to enjoy it more if i ' d seen it a couple hours earlier and had seen my favorite movie . now , it ' s one of those awful things .|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
with all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . yes , it ' s pretty funny , but if you really want to hear it , i guess you could have seen it last night . oh wait , i didn ' t sleep at all . my family has a great house and friends , but it ' s so bad i just couldn ' t stay in bed . one thing i remember distinctly is the smell of stale cigarettes from the living room . i ' m sure that was the first time they were ever allowed into the house .|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
"there are many film now on dvd , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . "" what is wrong with you tonight ? "" asked an anchorman as they walked out into the freezing cold , snow - free evening . "" this film is dreadful ! it has no value at all , not even in the movies i have seen . it is nothing compared to what i will watch tonight . let me tell you a little bit about my time in san francisco . i lived in los angeles for years and did not know how to make a living from the movie ."|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
` ` two hands ' ' is a good addition to the australian film catalogue . it is that curious mix of real life and an unreality movie . but since there are many films which are just plain funny , this one gets more humorous by the second . i am afraid that it will only make my day . i have seen enough films to know that if i do not read this one i will eventually lose my sanity . i mean , no , really , i think this movie is hilarious . as you probably can imagine , it has been made on every television industry channel in america .|0
this is definitely an excellent show . i do n ' t have cable , so i started renting them , because i wanted to see where they might be at this late date . one of the best shows i 've seen in almost 40 years . it was n't that big a deal ; i mean , there 's no point in paying any attention to what you are watching . i just wanted to watch it . but when i got out of my seat and saw what was sitting on top , my heart stopped . oh my god , it was worse than a bad horror movie !|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
surprisingly good made for t . v . thriller . i was n ' t expecting too much from this one but i ' m happy to see that it did . the plot is a little off , which is nice in an odd kind of way , but the premise is not exactly what you think it ought to be . the book is like a kid on his first day of school and he needs to learn the basics . the characters are so different from the rest of the kids that it just didn ' t sit right with anyone who wasn ' t part of the scene .|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
