"I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in a way that very few films have done before. The performances by Kate Winslet and David Kross were breathtaking, demonstrating the complexity of their characters with raw vulnerability and captivating passion. The movie delicately addresses the complicated subject of the Holocaust through the unconventional and ethically challenging romance between the protagonists. Its tender exploration of morality, love, guilt, and forgiveness make ""The Reader"" an exceptionally evocative and powerful film. Days later, I still find myself reflecting on the profound themes and lingering impact it has left on me."|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the South African Parliament, Mpondo is also a former anti-apartheid activist who endured horrific torture at the hands of the brutal officer during his imprisonment. Now, seeking justice for the past, Mpondo struggles to face his tormentor once more.

Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood textbooks, entering the Louvre Museum for the first time was an overwhelmingly awe-inspiring experience. Walking through its grand corridors, he marveled at how centuries of stories and voices seemed to be living through the silent yet compelling relics, paintings and sculptures that adorned the walls. Every artifact told a deeper, more fascinating story than any book had captured. Being physically present in that historic sanctum filled him with indescribable feelings and connections, far beyond just an educational experience.|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . Numerous films have been made available on DVD, however, producers have often overlooked certain titles that hold great significance to a large number of movie enthusiasts. These movies might have gained a dedicated fan following over the years and their unavailability can be disheartening for true film connoisseurs. To make these underappreciated gems accessible to a wider audience, producers must delve into their extensive catalogs and consider releasing these influential classics, including any noteworthy foreign films, for fans and collectors alike to relish and preserve for future generations.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have a traditional narrative or structure, but this only adds to its surreal and dreamlike quality. Shot in the unforgiving deserts of Africa, the imagery is as striking as it is hypnotic, challenging the viewer's perceptions of reality. With its thought-provoking philosophical musings and hauntingly beautiful cinematography, Fata Morgana weaves a meditative tapestry that immerses audiences in a mystical world. It is an experience that defies categorization, cementing its place as a truly unforgettable work of cinematic art.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone suggest similar movies with such talented actresses? The plot was captivating and had a perfect blend of romance, comedy, and suspense that kept me entertained throughout. The chemistry between the lead actors was on point, creating a captivating on-screen experience. Also, the direction and cinematography truly added to the overall appeal of the movie. In case you're looking for a lighthearted, feel-good movie with excellent acting, I'd highly recommend it. If you have other suggestions, feel free to share!|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
"If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What many people may not know is that the legendary actor John Wayne, affectionately known as ""The Duke,"" starred in a number of films before achieving fame in the Western genre. This Lone Star production highlights a youthful and ambitious Wayne as he tackles complex roles in a burgeoning movie industry. Set against the scenic backdrop of America's Old West, you'll enjoy timeless action scenes, heartfelt camaraderie, and unparalleled entertainment as Wayne embarks on captivating adventures."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford had the creative freedom to tell an intimate and engaging story that resonated deeply with audiences. There were no overblown budgets, no expectations to draw large crowds, no pressure to deliver extravagant action sequences. Instead, this small canvas allowed Ford to delve into the nuances of characters and relationships, resulting in a timeless tale of love, loss, and hope. Without the burdens faced by many big productions, this little picture managed to captivate hearts and remind us of the beauty of simplicity in storytelling.|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie left a bittersweet impression on me. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's novel, the film grapples with love, morality, and post-Holocaust Germany. The story revolves around a passionate affair between a young man, Michael, and a significantly older woman, Hanna. This dynamic further complicates as their pasts, secrets, and the traumas they bear unfold on screen. Skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader masterfully conveys the anguish and turmoil that the characters experience while attempting to reconcile with their history and emotions.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my taste), this intense thriller delivers a chilling experience. The intricate plot keeps you hooked till the very end as it unravels dark motives and disturbing mind games. While not a psychological masterpiece, it does push the boundaries of its genre with gut-wrenching and jaw-dropping scenes, expertly marrying fear and tension with harrowing realism. Strong, gritty performances by the actors enhance the story, creating three-dimensional, flawed characters who exhibit various shades of good and evil.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the address where this theory is put to the test. Nestled in a quaint suburban neighborhood, this house has become the center of an elaborate ruse, as locals perpetuate the false story of it being haunted. As more and more people relay the chilling tales of ghosts lurking in the hallways, the boundaries between fiction and reality seem to blur, and the haunting facade becomes indistinguishable from the actual supernatural activity, proving the extent to which manipulation can truly deceive human perception.|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent , an accomplished director who is known for his skill in creating captivating content for the small screen. With its compelling storyline, engaging characters, and a brilliant execution, this movie serves as proof that TV films can also be on par with feature-length productions. Not to mention, Joe Sargent's fine attention to detail and the use of innovative storytelling techniques really sets the film apart. So if you're a fan of quality television, do not hesitate to check this film out.|0
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets were reused in this film, demonstrating the studio's resourcefulness in creating visually stunning productions while staying within budget constraints. This classic cinematic masterpiece was skillfully crafted and utilized state-of-the-art camera and sound technology of the time, making it one of the iconic examples of early widescreen cinema. A standout feature of the film is the engaging storytelling which combined action, drama, and historical themes seamlessly, appealing to audiences of various backgrounds.|0
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this film. Yes, it may have its flaws and inconsistencies, but overall, I believe it offers an engaging story, strong performances, and an emotional connection with its audience. The visuals and sound design are immersive, pulling viewers into a thrilling, dramatic narrative. As a fan of cinema, I always appreciate films that leave me feeling entertained, reflective, or simply glad to have taken the time to experience a particular story.|0
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later became a cult classic. Set in a dystopian world where Lou and Sam have to navigate through the post-apocalyptic terrain, their witty repartee quickly gained a fan following. Dead Rail gave a glimpse into humanity's darker side, with people grasping onto the remains of the collapsed society and surviving against all odds. As Lou's sidekick, Sam provided a blend of dark humor, charisma, and wit, solidifying our duo's reputation in the hearts of movie buffs.|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This gem from the past is like unearthing a treasure trove for nostalgia buffs and movie fanatics alike. Bursting with vibrant colors, a powerhouse of energetic performances and showcasing the Aussie sense of humor and raw spirit of the 70s, this astonishing blend of unforgettable Australiana and foot-stomping glam-rock hits the mark in every way.

I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me. There's something undeniably captivating about a movie that explores the human experience and psyche, unencumbered by big budget gimmicks or A-list celebrities. What independent films lack in production value, they make up for in depth and nuance. A truly memorable indie movie sinks its hooks into your soul, leaving you introspective, emotional, or provoked – sometimes, all at once. More than just mindless entertainment, these artful narratives ignite thought and discussions about social and personal issues.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore had a baby and named her Rory, who quickly became the center of her world. Set in the quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, the series focuses on the dynamic mother-daughter duo as they navigate life, love, and everything in between. Lorelai, now managing the Independence Inn, constantly juggles her complicated relationship with her parents, work challenges, and many quirky friends. Meanwhile, Rory experiences typical teenage struggles like academics, friendships, and romance – all with her unique brand of humor and intelligence.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is a refreshing change from the usual predictable comedy, incorporating a perfect balance of wit and sarcasm that keeps the audience on their toes. The eccentric characters are portrayed brilliantly, with each bringing their own unique quirks and complexities that add layers to the storyline. The smart dialogues and the creative direction contribute to its overall appeal. While exploring some dark and unexpected themes, the film cleverly navigates between humorous and dramatic moments. A truly memorable and distinctive experience worth watching for anyone craving originality and an excellent time.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the weekend and found it to be engaging, as well as educational. The film managed to accurately depict the significant historical events while keeping the attention of younger viewers. The characters were well-developed, making it easier for the audience to understand their motives and the circumstances surrounding their actions. While the film may have taken some creative liberties, it sparked curiosity among my students to research further into the actual events, which in my opinion is an excellent outcome for any historical movie.|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about cinema or actors at that time, but the enchanting storytelling and the vivid colors captivated my young mind. The vibrant characters played by actors unknown to me felt like a thrilling adventure beyond my usual mundane life. Watching this film felt like I had opened a doorway to an incredible new world of cinematic fantasy. Little did I know then that this experience would not only shape my love for movies but also inspire me to be more imaginative in life.|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces . ""3 Godfathers"" (1948) boasts a unique story that conveys genuine emotions through raw human connections rather than gunfights and chases. The premise follows three outlaws who become surrogate fathers to an abandoned baby, forcing them to navigate both physical and emotional deserts on a redemptive path. Poignant in its execution and dripping with themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and redemption, Ford deftly weaves heartbreak with comic relief through unforgettable performances from his lesser-known cast."|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because it brings such a sense of nostalgia, warmth, and relatability. The witty and fast-paced dialogue between Lorelai and Rory, combined with the idyllic setting of Stars Hollow, truly make this show a feel-good masterpiece. As a young woman, I deeply connect with the issues the characters face: love, loss, ambition, family and friendships. Every character brings a unique charm, which makes it nearly impossible to have a favorite.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy I cannot emphasize enough the remarkable portrayal of Williams by Chris Diamantopoulos throughout the show. The depth he brought to his character's personality truly transcended the expectations for the series. The emotional nuances, along with the perfectly timed mannerisms, truly highlight the incredible range of Diamantopoulos as an actor. The captivating screen presence combined with an incredibly immersive performance deserved recognition in the form of an Emmy award. It is astonishing and disheartening to see that his phenomenal acting did not receive the credit it clearly merited.|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic and mesmerizing performance that combines the beauty of traditional Irish music and dance with contemporary flair. The ensemble showcases astounding precision, timing, and synchrony, taking my breath away as they grace the stage with powerful yet elegant movements. Live musicians only add to the palpable energy, capturing the essence of Irish culture through the lively tunes. Remarkable solo performances effortlessly merge with ensemble pieces, creating a rich visual tapestry that left me entranced.|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America. Set against the vibrant backdrop of mid-20th century Manhattan, the film brilliantly showcases the city's rich cultural history and exudes a genuine vintage atmosphere. From bustling jazz clubs and high-end fashion boutiques, to classic cocktail bars and eclectic street performers, it vividly captures the essence of the sophisticated, diverse urban landscape during this transformative period. A unique glimpse into a bygone era, this movie takes the audience on an immersive visual journey, painting an alluring portrait of high-brow New York City life during its cultural heyday.|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 .8 average rating. While not a perfect film, it undoubtedly deserves better recognition than what it's been given. This movie managed to strike a chord with its fascinating storyline and engaging characters. Despite some pacing issues and predictable moments, the film succeeded in capturing the viewer's attention and leaving a lasting impression. It could have benefitted from better direction, but the unique concept alone is enough for people to appreciate the creativity put into the film.|0
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to create his more artistic and personally meaningful projects. Ford's desire for artistic integrity led him to master the fine balance between commercial success and creative vision, often delivering outstanding movies that won awards and generated significant revenue. His innovative film-making techniques, combined with rich storytelling and captivating character development, elevated the entire industry's expectations of what a movie could and should be.

I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked ( the original version and was interested to see how they had adapted it for a modern audience. To my surprise and delight, the filmmakers managed to maintain the charm and essence of the original while infusing it with contemporary themes and technology. The actors truly embodied the characters, with performances that brought a sense of depth and humanity. Visually, the cinematography was stunning, showcasing the vivid landscapes that gave life to the story.|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing and outstanding performances from the cast. The intricate storyline keeps the viewers engaged while showcasing creative ingenuity in developing character arcs.

I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one in his impressive repertoire that centers around a group of Mormon pioneers searching for their promised land. Released in 1950, this Western film offers a different perspective, moving away from the conventional lone cowboy narrative to depict the struggles of a whole community on a wagon trail, as they strive for peace, love, and tolerance in the face of numerous obstacles. Noted for its stark cinematography and extraordinary ensemble performances, Wagon Master showcases the director's commitment to powerful human stories.|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film.

"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""hardboiled"" detective fiction. Pioneered by the likes of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, these stories focused on the cynical, world-weary private investigators as they navigated through seedy urban environments filled with corruption, deceit, and violence. Rather than neat puzzle-like whodunits, hardboiled fiction delved into social realism and moral ambiguity, creating a more gripping portrayal of crime and those who fought against it. With gritty prose and morally ambiguous antiheroes, the 1930s crime fiction had a major impact on shaping modern detective and mystery fiction."|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? Both Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar have indeed had successful careers after Saved by the Bell; however, it is a subjective question to ask if comparing their post-show acting careers is justifiable or fair. Every actor takes different paths, plays diverse roles, and builds their own legacy. Tiffani has achieved remarkable recognition in shows like Beverly Hills, 90210 and White Collar, while Mark-Paul has successfully landed main roles in series like NYPD Blue and Franklin & Bash.|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new episodes are airing, I am just thrilled. The storyline and characters never cease to make me laugh and cheer me up when I'm down. It's not just the comedy though, it's also the heartfelt moments that genuinely touch my emotions. I feel as if I am growing alongside the characters, and they become a sort of extended family to me. It is truly rare to find a TV show with such heart, depth and realness.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have been searching for it everywhere, but it seems nearly impossible to find. I've already tried looking through popular platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, as well as scouring torrent websites, but all of my efforts have proved fruitless. If anyone could direct me to a local rental store or online streaming website where I can finally get a copy of this video or film, it would be greatly appreciated!|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has successfully reimagined the classic Robin Hood legend in a comedic and lighthearted way. Starring Cary Elwes as the charismatic and charming Robin Hood, the film lampoons the cliches and stereotypes prevalent in earlier adaptations of the timeless story. Complete with catchy musical numbers and a witty script filled with double entendres, Men in Tights brilliantly blends slapstick and verbal humor, satisfying both new and seasoned fans of Robin Hood. Mel Brooks proves, once again, his mastery in satire, making this movie an unforgettable addition to his exceptional body of work.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are settling there. The traders, experienced in striking deals, are keen to profit from the Mormons' needs. The Mormon leader, aware of the challenges in building their settlement, is cautious but hopeful about the prospects the traders offer. The two parties engage in spirited negotiations, forging an agreement that seems fair for both. In the days to come, the traders provide horses and services vital for the growth and progress of the settlement.|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It explores complex social and psychological themes while captivating the audience with powerful storytelling. The director skillfully combines elements of drama and intrigue with a sensitivity towards real human issues. Today's documentaries challenge conventional beliefs, encourage us to ask difficult questions, and prompt self-reflection. With their artistic cinematography, honest narratives, and impeccable research, these films can be life-changing experiences. They evoke powerful emotions, engage the audience in thought-provoking conversations, and remind us of our shared humanity in this diverse and ever-changing world.|0
"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it might seem on the surface. After his captivating work on ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""Black Snake Moan"", Brewer has proven to possess a unique storytelling ability and a strong grasp of complex, dynamic characters. Even if the premise of his upcoming project appears questionable, I have faith that Brewer's unparalleled directorial prowess and screenwriting talent will successfully bring a seemingly poor concept to life with skill and emotional resonance. Hence, his filmography demands further exploration and attention, earning him a loyal follower in me."|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie , and Ashley from the classic Gone with the Wind, this new cinematic spectacle has its own distinctive flair. Fusing themes of passion, heartache, and betrayal against the grandeur of the backdrop, the gripping narrative is infused with a modern perspective. Enthralling cinematography accompanies beautifully curated sets, making every scene an artistic gem. Coupled with superb acting from an exquisite ensemble cast that does more than echo their famed predecessors, audiences are treated to an emotionally immersive and visually-stunning period drama experience that stands on its own merits.|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is truly a gem in the vast sea of TV shows out there today. The plot is captivating, filled with unexpected twists and turns that constantly keep the audience guessing. The humor is intelligent, sharp and perfectly executed by a stellar ensemble cast that brings their characters to life. The writing, both in dialogue and storyline development, never falters or falls short of the high bar it sets for itself. Viewers who dive into this masterpiece are met with laughter, emotions, and thrills.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going on with a major reveal that is bound to shock everyone. Despite previous assumptions and misleading hints, it turns out that the protagonist is in fact Mel's estranged twin brother. In a twisted series of events, their lives become dangerously entangled as family secrets come to light. Characters you believed to be innocent reveal darker intentions, forcing Mel to confront these newfound betrayals. Tensions rise as hidden motives emerge, shattering relationships and exposing lies in this unexpected, thrilling twist of a narrative.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less and less clear as the plot unfolds, leaving viewers bewildered yet fascinated by this quirky masterpiece. Both the characters and the storyline dance on a fine line between sanity and insanity, as viewers find themselves constantly re-evaluating their initial judgments. With moments of dark humor and heartbreaking vulnerability, the film dives deep into the complexities of the human psyche, ultimately proving that perhaps all of us have a touch of madness within us.|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired). It's a brilliant homage to his classic style, complete with spine-chilling music and heart-racing suspense. The combination of action and horror creates an electrifying atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the characters remain compelling throughout the story. What makes this movie even more special are the nods to some of Carpenter's greatest works. So, for fans who relish in all things 80's and Carpenter-esque, this film is definitely a must-watch.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant stream of negative reviews it has received. It seems that viewers went in expecting a life-changing masterpiece, only to be disappointed. But in reality, this film doesn't aspire to change your life, it aims to entertain and it certainly achieves that goal. Despite its predictable storyline and cliched characterizations, this film remains enjoyable and visually captivating. The talented cast and top-notch production values offer a level of escapism that many could benefit from, especially in today's turbulent times.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the chemistry between him and Marian is simply enchanting. The supporting characters, such as Friar Tuck and Little John, add a perfect mix of comedy and drama, making the whole story even more captivating. The vivid cinematography transports the audience to the Sherwood Forest, and the period-authentic costumes and set design immerse us into the world of medieval England. Additionally, the thrilling action scenes and dramatic musical score will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the film.|0
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some old DVDs at a garage sale, and boy, am I glad I picked it up! The storyline was incredibly captivating and the acting was top-notch. The soundtrack just added to the amazing vibe the film brought. Even though the visuals and special effects were clearly a bit dated, they still had a nostalgic charm to them. I would highly recommend giving this hidden gem a watch if you're in the mood for a fantastic throwback film. You won't be disappointed!|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
"Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now by watching the last remaining series. Though the final Perry and Croft creation isn't as well-known as their other masterpieces like ""Dad's Army,"" ""Are You Being Served?"" and ""It Ain't Half Hot Mum,"" it still brings in the nostalgic vibes from the duo's classic writing. Upon starting the fourth installment, I noticed their undeniable talent of creating memorable characters and skillfully weaving lighthearted comedy through an ensemble of unique personalities."|0
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The movie transports viewers into the twisted and disturbed consciousness of the murderer, pushing the boundaries of reality and delving deep into the horrifying fantasies that drive their actions. Filled with dark, surreal, and shocking imagery, the film masterfully interweaves suspense and terror to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The audience becomes both detective and psychologist, navigating through layers of brutality and discovering disturbing insights into the true nature of evil.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which chronicles the story of two families – the Hazards, from the North, and the Mains, from the South – against the backdrop of the Civil War. Featuring an ensemble cast, it effectively portrays the friendship, love, rivalry, and enmity between the families, their ties deepening amidst personal and societal upheavals. As the Civil War rages, both sides face monumental tragedies, family betrayals, and social clashes. As old wounds resurface, newfound alliances emerge.|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex ual innuendos, unoriginal storylines, and cookie-cutter love teams. To find gems among the current selection of films can prove to be a struggle. One cannot blame the viewers who opt for international or independent movies which showcase the kind of originality and depth in content, a stark contrast to mainstream Filipino offerings. What once were memorable and powerful themes from directors like Lino Brocka or Ishmael Bernal now mostly rely on provocative concepts to lure the audiences in, with the actual value of the storyline sometimes forgotten.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was an unforgettable experience. The whole event showcased a variety of animated masterpieces in a moody, mysterious style, typical of the Noir genre. At the Clinton Street Theater, the dimly lit setting and old-time vibe complemented the essence of Cartoon Noir. Each short film focused on gritty themes, sharp dialogue, and exaggerated, heavy shadows, leaving the audience intrigued and absorbed in every moment. Witnessing these dark tales unravel at such an intimate venue took the viewers on a riveting journey back to the heyday of classic film noir.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that 's what makes it captivating. It sheds light on the daily lives and struggles of ordinary Americans, presenting an honest reflection of their world. This honesty makes the characters relatable and easy to sympathize with, while the grounded storytelling approach ensures there's no sugarcoating. One of my favorites is an indie film that perfectly illustrates this - capturing raw emotions, inner conflicts, and hopes for a better life. It tackles relevant social issues and embraces both humor and heartbreak.|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actresses than Katharine Hepburn and Audrey Hepburn, no relation, to showcase in his films. Working with Katharine in classics like ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) and ""Little Women"" (1933), Cukor knew how to bring out the best in her strong-willed yet endearing characters. He showcased Audrey's charisma in his adaptation of the famous play ""My Fair Lady"" (1964), molding her into the perfect embodiment of the graceful and intelligent Eliza Doolittle."|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show as the no-nonsense yet kind-hearted mother figure, and Percy Kilbride (Pa) provides the perfect comic relief as the laid-back, loveable father. Together, they tackle life in their rural farm community, dealing with their eccentric children, meddling neighbors, and endless shenanigans. Audiences loved watching the crazy antics unfold and couldn't help but root for this offbeat family, as they overcame obstacles and tried to fit into the ever-changing society around them.|0
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats only a small detail. The storyline is gripping, the characters are incredibly well-developed, and the cinematography is truly stunning. Yes, there are similarities with Pulp Fiction, but it stands on its own as a fresh and unique experience. The twists and turns in the plot leave you guessing until the very end, making it impossible to predict the outcome. The perfect blend of drama, suspense, and humor provides a balanced and captivating experience.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the human condition, set against the beautiful and enchanting backdrop of Europe. The intertwining stories and dynamic characters captivate the viewer, while tackling complex themes of love, hope, dreams, and loss. The breathtaking cinematography immerses you in this journey, making every twist and turn more powerful and poignant. Coupled with an evocative and atmospheric soundtrack, the film invites you into a world that resonates with viewers long after they have left the Europe-plex theater.|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way as this one did. From the visually stunning cinematography to the deeply compelling storyline, I found myself entirely immersed in this cinematic masterpiece. The incredible performances by the talented ensemble of actors had me emotionally invested, resonating with their vulnerability and internal conflicts. I walked out of the theatre with an insatiable yearning to delve further into this captivating world and the complexities of its characters. It's a truly unforgettable experience, and one that has reinvigorated my appreciation for the art of filmmaking.|0
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I watched it, I was still pondering about the thought-provoking content and visuals. This masterpiece seemed to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality, keeping the audience in constant curiosity. The cinematography, coupled with an ambient musical score, successfully merged the realm of fine arts and factual accounts. This innovative fusion challenged the conventional understanding of cinema, pushing viewers to engage more critically with its content. Consequently, the film effortlessly struck a powerful chord with many viewers, leaving a lasting impact that undoubtedly transformed the landscape of visual storytelling.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have always been a fan of biopics that delve deep into a person's life, providing insight into their character and accomplishments. While this particular production was visually pleasing with high production values and convincing acting, it fell short in providing a comprehensive account of the individual's story. Though the limited runtime is understandable for TV constraints, more exploration of their journey could have enriched the overall narrative. Hopefully, future projects will take this opportunity to fully encapsulate a person's extraordinary life, leaving viewers more informed and captivated.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably fallen into obscurity over the years. This 1946 musical-mystery film directed by John English presents an engaging plot revolving around the world of music, suspense, and hidden motives. While the star-studded cast delivered memorable performances, with performances by legendary singer Vera Hruba Ralston and iconic detective figure, Warner Baxter, the movie still remains somewhat underappreciated. This often-overlooked classic combines both the glamour and thrill of its time while encapsulating an atmospheric vintage experience.|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store back in the early 2000s. It's incredible how much movies can shape our emotions and connections. At the time, I didn't have many friends and this movie filled that void, giving me a sense of belonging. I can still remember watching it in the backroom during my break with some microwave popcorn, completely drawn in by the compelling storyline and phenomenal performances. The amazing cinematography captivated me, and as each scene unfolded, it felt like I was there alongside the characters.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some years ago, pondering over potential box-office smashes that would cater to the whims and tastes of a discerning audience. As their conversations got infused with the spirit(s) of inspiration and avant-garde, they entertained each other with ideas as eclectic and diverse as their beverage menu, ranging from fantastical surrealist dreamscapes, neo-noir crime dramas, heart-tugging emotional stories, and immersive cinematic adventures filled with stunning visuals, remarkable scores, and masterful storytelling that aimed to hold global cinephiles captive.|0
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did ( besides marrying my mother) was introducing us to this film. We were instantly drawn into its unique world and powerful story, cementing our lifelong bond through a shared passion for cinema. Over the years, this film became an essential part of our life together, a common touchstone that fostered understanding and closeness. Watching it evokes warm memories of the excitement and optimism of youth, the nostalgic feeling of growing and evolving together, and the unmistakable spark that has kept us together for decades.|0
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which a group of friends are all having dinner together, laughing and enjoying each other's company. Seeing this now brought back so many fond memories of my youth – spending time with close friends, sharing countless stories and forging everlasting bonds. Despite the nostalgic sentiment, I also noticed how the movie’s storytelling, style and the societal contexts presented now seemed rather dated, allowing me to reflect on how times and cultures have significantly changed over the years.|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great sensitivity and skill, effectively engaging the audience throughout the entire film. The well-developed storyline was presented seamlessly and maintained a consistent balance of emotion, humor, and thought-provoking scenes that appealed to viewers of all ages. Moreover, the captivating performances by the talented cast elevated the movie experience, leaving everyone profoundly impacted. The captivating visuals and crisp cinematography, accompanied by a masterful musical score, immersed us further into the journey of the characters.|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . , which transports me back to an era filled with simple, poignant melodies and heartfelt emotions. Her sultry, smooth, and angelic voice speaks to my soul, echoing tales of love, longing, and sadness wrapped in harmonious grace. With her soothing, emotional, and down-to-earth tones, she stands as a symbol of a time where love songs meant to touch you to the very core, and meant the very same things, regardless of race or background.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute film, but it had an extremely limited release which left me feeling somewhat lucky to have caught it on the big screen. Chomps tells the tale of a lovable robot dog and the wacky adventures that ensue. The mix of humor and heartwarming moments was genuinely enjoyable, and I found myself quickly becoming attached to this little animated character. The voice cast delivered stellar performances, further breathing life into this endearing, albeit short-lived cinematic gem.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to revisit it recently. Upon re-watching the series, it has become even more enjoyable with its nostalgic and timeless appeal. This bizarre yet fascinating tale revolves around the character Gerald McBoing Boing, a unique child with a penchant for communicating through various sound effects rather than words. This creative story breaks boundaries, and ultimately becomes a classic representation of celebrating one's own quirks and individuality. Overcoming obstacles through genuine human connections, McBoing Boing brilliantly delivers a refreshing dose of imagination and innovation to the realm of cartoons.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite films, often considered as the pinnacle of his Western creations. Set against the vast and harsh landscape of the American frontier, Wagon Master is an emotional and visually captivating portrayal of life, struggle, and companionship on a perilous journey. The plot revolves around a diverse group of settlers, each seeking a new life and chasing their own unique dreams, as they join forces to traverse the treacherous terrain on their shared wagon train.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time, yet somehow, I keep getting drawn back into it, as if by some magnetic pull. It's as if the creators had the perfect recipe for mediocrity combined with an insidious addiction factor that I can't seem to escape. The cheesy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and frustratingly predictable storylines are infuriating to no end. Still, I find myself cringing my way through every painful, drawn-out episode as the sheer boredom from the experience momentarily staves off reality.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just give it a chance, it will instantly capture your heart with its wonderful mix of humor, character dynamics, and a touch of historical relevance. The show perfectly balances comedic moments with heartwarming storylines and lovable characters, each with their distinct personalities that wonderfully contribute to the comedic experience. Furthermore, Dad's Army portrays the courageous spirit of Britain during World War II, as the ragtag group of home guard members demonstrate determination, wit, and resilience.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of common questions. Firstly, the installation process is seamless and user-friendly, so you'll have no trouble getting started. Secondly, compatibility issues have been minimal; this works with most platforms and devices, so there shouldn't be any hindrances. The user interface is intuitive and simple, allowing both newbies and experienced users to navigate it with ease. Performance-wise, it's impressive with minimal glitches and crashes. In terms of support, the response time is prompt and customer care staff is knowledgeable.|0
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the accuracy and attention to detail in this piece. It not only captures the essence of that tumultuous period in American history but also delves deeper into the personal stories and experiences of the people involved, on both sides of the conflict. From the powerful emotions of loss and despair to moments of victory and resilience, this work offers a fresh perspective on the Civil War while remaining true to its core. Moreover, it brilliantly highlights the key aspects that shaped the nation and contributed to its current social and cultural dynamics.|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
"Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes this past week has to be ""rollercoaster."" It's been a mix of ups and downs, from work projects taking unexpected turns, to catching up with old friends and rekindling connections. To top it all off, I've started diving into new hobbies and challenges - an attempt at breaking out of my comfort zone. Despite the chaos, I can't deny that I'm actually enjoying this whirlwind of events."|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
"`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory , and bizarre, ""Side Show"" takes the viewer on a twisted journey through a haunted carnival, filled with terrifyingly eerie characters and macabre scenes. Full Moon Pictures is renowned for their outlandish content and unforgettable storylines, and ""Side Show"" certainly does not disappoint in this regard. Set against a sinister backdrop, the movie invites the audience to engage in a spine-chilling experience, where gore is in abundance and terrifying surprises await around every corner."|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , captivating performances, and an engaging plot contribute to making this period piece a true gem. Exploring themes such as societal norms, gender roles, and relationships, it reflects on the dynamic transformations in cultural values over the decades. The well-rounded characters evoke empathy and provoke discussions about progress and acceptance, while the beautiful costume design and captivating cinematography immerse viewers in the essence of the era. Overall, this film not only transports you back in time, but also sparks valuable reflections on our present-day perspective on various social aspects.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of chess obsession that sweeps through an entire Russian town. Released in 1925, 'Chess Fever' masterfully intertwines the game's complexities with comic and absurd situations. As the frenzy unfolds, everyone in town, regardless of age, gender, or profession, succumbs to the unbridled passion for chess. Daily activities, romantic relationships, and even the bustling town square come to a standstill as residents are engrossed in games and strategic moves.|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a director's cut version. Countless fans have expressed their desire to see the unedited version, but Fox seems unwilling to listen. The edited version has its fair share of memorable scenes, but undoubtedly falls short of its true potential due to these needless edits. The acting is on point, and the story intrigues, but the lack of a full and unhindered vision really keeps it from rising above the typical blockbuster flick.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . In essence, being ""Blue"" signifies a heightened level of consciousness and awareness during this unusual era we're living in. This encompasses having a keen understanding of not only your own emotions and thought patterns but also being receptive to the emotions and mental well-being of those around you. Furthermore, to be ""Blue"" means to navigate through this uncertainty with an open mind, promoting empathy, kindness, and patience while proactively addressing and working towards positive changes in society."|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has ever been a part of, but also one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of our time. With a compelling plot and incredibly poignant character development, this film expertly balances emotion with powerful, relatable storylines. Furthermore, Jon Voight delivers an extraordinary and unforgettable performance that speaks to his astounding range as an actor. This film, expertly crafted and unforgettably heartrending, elevates Jon Voight's illustrious career to new heights while remaining true to its grounded and humanistic roots.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
"This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross . ""The Land of Dreamers"" showcases the seedy underworld and grim realities faced by a ragtag crew of small-time criminals trying to navigate life in the notorious Kings Cross neighborhood. With their quirks, dubious morals, and dead-end aspirations, these characters provide a raw depiction of the fringe members of society in late 90s Australia. The gritty cinematography, authentic dialogues, and complex characters manage to captivate audiences as the gang tries to hustle their way up in the unforgiving world they inhabit."|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , some Hollywood directors and producers would decide to deviate from the standard horror formula and opt for a more campy and humorous approach. This was perfectly epitomized with the advent of the ""horror-comedy"" sub-genre, providing a unique blend of dark humor and satirical commentary that emerged during that time period. One of the most successful and enduring examples of the horror-comedy genre was 1984's 'Gremlins', directed by Joe Dante, which ingeniously married together dark horror themes and outlandish creature features with clever satirical gags and relatable situational humor."|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to a strong and empowered woman, I was filled with a sense of excitement and liberation. This compelling tale brilliantly captures the essence of finding oneself and one's sexual identity amidst the chaos of the late '60s counterculture. With bold colors, evocative imagery, and breathtaking performances, the film transports the audience to a world where barriers were being broken, and freedoms explored. My heart raced alongside Alice's journey as she sought pleasure, discovery, and personal growth against a vibrant, evocative backdrop of defiance and individualism.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully irreverent take on the classic narrative. The film delights in its self-awareness and sharply penned dialogue, constantly poking fun at both the genre and the audience's expectations. The characters are well-drawn, even while lampooning familiar stereotypes, and the on-screen chemistry between the leads drives much of the comedy. Some might argue that originality is key, but the inventive and riotous spin that the movie puts on its tropes ensures its fresh, delightful appeal.|0
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. ""Deepwoods Massacre"" (1983) manages to capture the haunting, creepy atmosphere and dread of those times quite well, standing alongside cult classics like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". It revolves around a group of teenagers venturing into a remote, wooded area only to be confronted with an unspeakable terror lurking in the shadows. Unlike its contemporaries, the film emphasizes more on the eerie setting and psychological tension rather than relying solely on gore and graphic violence."|0
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we couldn't get enough of the catchy songs and engaging storyline. The characters were both hilarious and relatable, making it enjoyable for both children and adults. The vibrant animation and the voice cast were impressive and added extra magic to the film. We found ourselves singing and dancing along to the tunes, even after the movie had ended. Not only was it entertaining, but the movie also imparted some valuable lessons on friendship, love, and teamwork.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award ceremonies. The series showcases incredible chemistry between the lead actors, Kevin James and Leah Remini, that successfully propels the humorous aspects of everyday life. Their authentic portrayal of a quirky couple deeply resonates with the audience. Alongside them, Jerry Stiller's comedic talent as Arthur Spooner remains truly noteworthy. Despite its humble presentation and familiar tropes, King of Queens consistently entertains and finds laughter in genuine connections. I believe the series genuinely deserved greater recognition and accolades for its nine-year run that made it a fan-favorite comedy.|0
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . I found their music to be an exemplary fusion of soulful vocals and melodious tunes that encapsulates the essence of the 1970s musical era. Karen Carpenter's velvet voice effortlessly conveyed emotions in every track, touching the hearts of listeners. Richard's flair for songwriting and orchestration gave each piece depth and charm, and together, their talent translated into an impressive discography. They created evergreen classics, helping many build connections with nostalgia and often working as solace in times of stress.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , the perfect feel-good film to watch with friends. The storyline captured our attention right from the start and held us emotionally engaged till the end. The characters were well-developed, relatable, and truly brought the plot to life. The beautiful visuals and soothing music perfectly complemented the onscreen drama, evoking strong emotions within us. Overall, we laughed, cried, and felt every emotion throughout the film, leaving us feeling fulfilled and thoroughly entertained.|0
"I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply amazing! From the jaw-dropping visuals to the impeccable musicianship, Rush once again exceeded all of my expectations. This band just continues to showcase their incredible talent and ageless energy, which make them so legendary. The setlist at this concert perfectly combines classics like ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" with some lesser-known gems, ensuring every fan has a song to cherish. Rush's performance is engaging, emotional, and technically precise."|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it was recently uploaded to a streaming platform. It absolutely lived up to my expectations! The film was everything I hoped it would be: eerie, suspenseful, and the right amount of campy. The old-school special effects blended well with the overall atmosphere, successfully creating the terrifying, edge-of-your-seat vibe. Despite the movie being relatively underrated in the realm of classic horror thrillers, it’s genuinely a hidden gem worth every second spent finding it.|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic 's platform. I mean, this isn't just a simple animated show – it's a groundbreaking, layered masterpiece that weaves humor, emotion, and intellectual brilliance into every single frame. From the stellar voice cast to the brilliant animation, every aspect of this cartoon deserves recognition and appreciation. Anyone who claims otherwise is simply turning a blind eye to artistic ingenuity. Furthermore, the cultural impact and relatability of this masterpiece allows viewers of all ages to connect on a profound level.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being forced into retirement by his board of directors. Feeling defeated, he plots revenge by creating a new musical production designed to be a massive failure. His assistant, played charmingly by Judith Thayle, discovers the plan but, seeing his determination, secretly recruits a talented young cast and production team to save the show. With delightful music, well-executed dance numbers, and numerous plot twists, the stage is set for an entertaining journey that follows a heartfelt story of redemption and friendship, proving that the show truly must go on.|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . I must admit that I was skeptical at first, but as I watched it unfold, I found myself laughing uncontrollably. The humor was just so unexpected, quirky, and refreshingly different from the usual comedy that one may find. It left me wanting more! In today's fast-paced world, having a quick burst of comedy that is effective in tickling our funny bones is what makes shorts like these stand out from the rest.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1

"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . I found it to be a truly enlightening experience, delving deeper into the various aspects of French culture and society. The movie beautifully captured the nuances of everyday life in France, and also the traditions that make it so unique. Through the characters, dialogues, and scenes, I could clearly sense the essence of their history and way of living. As I discussed the movie with my classmates and analyzed its message, I realized the richness and diversity of the French culture.|0
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis because the title itself speaks for its beauty and essence.

Gorgeously interweaving love and yearning, the enchanting characters are whisked through adventures filled with starlit encounters and playful rendezvous, each nocturnal meeting deepening the inexplicable connection they share. Tender and evocative, the Tale of the Cat and the Moon teaches us the power of dreams, resilience, and the depths of the heart's desire.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , each one quirky and unique, creating a delightful tapestry of personalities. The dark humor interwoven throughout the story makes even the tensest moments enjoyable, while the emotional beats offer moments of sincere connection between the characters. Nurse Betty showcases brilliantly balanced pacing, ensuring viewers are entertained while fully understanding the intricate relationships at play. Add in exceptional cinematography and you have yourself a truly unforgettable movie-watching experience that's destined to leave its mark in the annals of film history.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1

However, its brilliance was eventually discovered by critics and indie-film lovers, transforming it into a hidden gem in the realm of cinema.

Fueled by their passion for genuine storytelling, the cast delivered outstanding performances, accompanied by a subtle but moving soundtrack.

This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged in equal measure. The performances were captivating, the storyline complex, yet easy to follow, and the cinematography truly awe-inspiring. While exploring relevant and important social themes, the director still manages to inject humor, making it a captivating watch for audiences of all ages. Despite its intense moments, the film remains an overall feel-good experience, allowing viewers to leave the cinema both reflecting and smiling. Don't miss this stunning cinematic gem – a must-see that promises to linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV show adaptation that's going to flop miserably. '' But boy, was I wrong. From the moment the opening credits rolled, I was pulled into the storyline and couldn't peel my eyes away. The cinematography was stunning and the acting - incredibly on point. In fact, the characters were so engaging, that it barely felt like an adaptation; more of a reinvention, with the essence of the original, sprinkled with a modern twist.|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand , it has some genuinely engaging moments of dark humor and clever plot twists, showcasing the uniqueness of Australian storytelling. On the other hand, it struggles to maintain a cohesive tone and falters under the weight of convoluted plotlines, wavering between bizarre, comedic incidents and intensely gritty, uncomfortable moments. The film has a strong local flavor, with its outback settings, colorful characters, and impenetrable accents - making it alluring to both local and foreign audiences.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever watched. The show revolves around the lovable relationship between a young single mother, Lorelai Gilmore, and her fiercely intelligent daughter, Rory. Set in the charming town of Stars Hollow, the duo navigate their way through love, friendship, and various odd town traditions. Accompanied by a rich supporting cast of eccentric characters, Gilmore Girls delivers witty dialogues and memorable pop-culture references at a break-neck speed, ensuring there's never a dull moment.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time ! This film truly captures the essence of Elton's extraordinary musical genius. Not only were the sound and audio quality top-notch, but the masterful use of his soothing and captivating melodies leaves the viewers feeling as if they were enveloped in a warm embrace. Moreover, the cinematography and the visuals in the movie further elevate its brilliance, portraying Elton's journey and talent beautifully on screen. The film perfectly marries its visual and audio elements to provide an unforgettable, immersive experience for the audience.|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to the theater with high expectations. As the lights dimmed and the film began, it quickly became clear that it would leave a lasting impression on me. With its captivating storyline, memorable characters, and remarkable performances by the talented cast, this movie not only met my expectations but far exceeded them. In retrospect, it was an innovative and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece for that time, with lasting cultural relevance even today. Every scene of the film held my interest and transported me to the intriguing world the director had crafted.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it transport you to another world and leave your own life behind for a brief moment, immersing yourself in the characters' experiences and the unfolding storyline. This magical experience is enhanced when the cinematography is beautifully crafted, accompanied by powerful and moving performances from the actors. There's a real sense of emotional escapism in movie viewing, as well as the opportunity to gain fresh insights and perspectives, learning from the journeys and growth of those characters that manage to resonate with us in meaningful and profound ways.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I finally had the chance to watch it the other day and I must say, it definitely lived up to my expectations. The visuals were stunning and the plot was full of thrilling twists and turns that kept me engaged throughout. The performances from the main actors were brilliant, delivering just the right blend of emotion and action. I was impressed by the balance between special effects and storytelling which, together, kept the adrenaline pumping from beginning to end.|0
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the episode is of a quirky little store called ""What's in a Grain,"" a clever play on Shakespeare's line ""What's in a name,"" showcasing that not even grocery shops can escape their humor. This trend only grows more comical as we get a glimpse of some animal-based parodies like ""Jurassic Pork,"" ""Raging Bull Frog,"" and the ice cream joint ""Sundae Gogh,"" a cute nod to Vincent Van Gogh."|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school basketball game as part of a probation requirement for a minor offense. At first, the troubled senior clashes with the diverse teammates and strict coaches, dismissing their passion and dedication to the sport. Over time, as the team members relentlessly work to break down his walls, he slowly learns the values of humility, cooperation, and teamwork. This challenging journey helps transform him, leading to a heartfelt moment of redemption during the nail-biting final game, where he truly becomes a vital part of the all-star team.|0
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across a fascinating documentary about deep-sea creatures. The vivid imagery and mesmerizing facts about their mysterious world captivated me, making me lose track of time. Suddenly, I realized I was running late for work, and I rushed to grab my things, turning off the T.V. on my way out. Throughout the day, my mind kept drifting back to those underwater wonders. My fascination with their bizarre appearances and adaptive abilities ignited a new interest and determination to learn more about our ocean's hidden treasures.|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked butt are all delightful aspects that you won't want to miss. Not to mention the captivating plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what twist or turn may come next. Additionally, the all-star cast delivers phenomenal performances, bringing their characters to life and further immersing the audience into the world of the film. The exquisite cinematography adds another layer to this movie-going experience, making this visually stunning work an absolute treat for the eyes.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must lead, unable to appreciate and comprehend the intricacies and nuances of this cinematic masterpiece. It is, of course, not every moviegoer's cup of tea, and subjective opinions may vary, but dismissing it outright showcases a profound ignorance and a clear disconnection from the art of filmmaking. It begs the question - what joy and satisfaction does the critic draw from movies? To immerse oneself in such brilliance and not be captivated can only make one ponder what exceptional universe of artistic fulfillment they inhabit, seemingly untouched by human hand.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to embrace diversity and engage in collaborative efforts across borders. This emerging dynamic within the youth is empowering and encourages them to recognize their collective potential, celebrate cultural richness and forge stronger bonds between the different countries. As these youths rise into leadership positions, this new wave of cooperation in the EU could translate into improved economic policies, educational systems, and technological advancements benefiting all member countries. Thus, planting the seeds for an interconnected European Union that takes strength from unity while proudly sustaining cultural diversity.|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series until it's well underway, maybe even near the end of its run. Case in point, we only recently discovered the brilliance of ""Breaking Bad,"" though the series concluded almost a decade ago. Binge-watching it now, we wonder how we could have missed such incredible storytelling and phenomenal acting. It seems this slow approach allows us to experience hidden gems on our own terms, even though it might put us behind in popular culture conversations."|0
"As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by two violent thugs, her life turns into a mixture of fear, sadness, and twisted fantasy. Emotionally shaken, she loses her grip on reality and begins to fully immerse herself in her favorite soap opera, ""A Reason to Love."" Soon enough, her mental and emotional distress compels her to embark on a quest to track down her favorite actor, Dr. David Ravell ( Greg Kinnear ), in order to seek salvation, solace, and love."|0
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be the best night of his life. Arriving at the quaint comedy club, the anticipation in the air was palpable. As the acts progressed, each performer had him bursting with laughter, a much-needed release after his monotonous routine. The laughter therapy continued and as if the fates conspired to uplift his spirits further, a connection sparked with the woman seated beside him. Together they laughed and cheered, sharing snippets of their lives.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in cinema even at that young age). It was a transformative experience that further fueled my passion for movies. The film captured my imagination with its spellbinding storyline, engaging characters, and mesmerizing visuals, leaving a lasting impact on me. Years later, I find myself frequently revisiting this cinematic masterpiece and marveling at its timeless brilliance. Through it, I learned the power of storytelling, sparking my own desire to be a part of the creative world.|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd expect from a futuristic sci-fi movie scene. The unconventional camera angles and obscure visual effects seem to be deliberately crafted to make you feel like you're in an otherworldly space. Personally, I appreciate this sort of creative take on visual storytelling, as it adds a unique atmosphere and immersion that distinguishes it from traditional approaches. Despite some of the confusing imagery, the central message of the video does shine through and proves to be quite thought-provoking, sparking discussions about our future society and potential advancements in technology.|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's novel. This theatrical rendition masterfully captures the essence of Wilde's story, exploring the themes of vanity, moral corruption, and hedonism. The cast is exceptional, as they effectively portray the intricacies and dilemmas faced by their characters, giving them an authentic depth that maintains audience interest. The set design and lighting serve to enhance the dark, sinister tone of the play, taking audiences through a Victorian-era London setting that mirrors Dorian's moral descent.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired , overall it was an enjoyable experience. The plot revolves around a young and passionate teacher, Pat Conroy, who aims to break the barriers of race and ignorance in a remote island's segregated school. While the beginning and middle of the movie managed to grip me with engaging storytelling and heartfelt performances from Jon Voight and the young cast, it somewhat failed to tie up loose ends and effectively deliver an emotional conclusion.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all bring a unique element to the story that captivates the audience from start to finish. The exceptional ensemble not only showcases remarkable acting talent, but they also share great chemistry, ensuring that each scene comes to life on the screen. Moreover, the flawless blending of well-known actors with up-and-coming talents has further enriched the film, making it feel fresh and engaging. This brilliant casting decision truly enhances the movie-going experience, inviting viewers into a captivating and believable world filled with memorable performances.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! The acting was phenomenal, the plot had numerous twists and turns that kept me engaged from start to finish, and the cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking. Each character had depth and development throughout the film that had me emotionally invested in their stories. The soundtrack perfectly set the tone for each scene and pulled me even deeper into the world created by the director. This is one movie I can watch over and over again, never tiring of its captivating scenes and memorable dialogue.|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1

Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to say whatever he wants without consequences, causing quite the stir at school and in the town. He quickly becomes the face of a documentary focused on children living with this condition, taking full advantage of the newfound attention. Meanwhile, Kyle begins to recognize Cartman's deception and teams up with Stan to expose his friend as a fraud.

I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it, as it simply exceeded all of my expectations. The exceptional storytelling, brilliant performances from the cast, and stunning cinematography deserve nothing but high praises. I know that there are a variety of opinions and tastes when it comes to movies, but this masterpiece transcended that and truly resonated with me on an emotional level. If any movie has the capability to sweep the awards season, it would definitely be this one. Here's to hoping that it earns the accolades it wholeheartedly deserves!|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled This is a really great series. I love the show and I am so glad it isn't canceled. It constantly leaves me on the edge of my seat, with exciting storylines and engaging characters. The twists and turns in the plot keep me guessing, and the fantastic acting just brings the whole thing to life. It's rare to find such a consistently high-quality show these days, and it's become an essential part of my weekly viewing routine.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a spectacular combination of mesmerizing tunes, compelling lyrics, and masterful performances that captivate the soul.

"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts just like the late, great comedian, capturing his infectious energy, unique expressions, and quick-witted humor flawlessly. Chris Diamantopoulos truly embodies Robin Williams' spirit in his performance, showcasing a great range of emotion, making you feel as if Robin himself was back on the screen. The versatile talent displayed by Chris brings so much depth to the character, honoring Williams' incredible legacy and inspiring a new generation of viewers. It's no wonder that his portrayal has been lauded by both critics and audiences alike.|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . While I might not be an avid admirer of westerns, these two films have managed to pique my interest and hold a special place in my heart. Unforgiven and Tombstone embody compelling storytelling combined with rich, complex characters, making them standout in this genre. Whether it's the moral ambiguities that unfold throughout Unforgiven or the legendary tales of lawlessness brought to life in Tombstone, I'm always drawn into these mesmerizing worlds.|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and the crimes committed under apartheid. The gripping drama follows human rights lawyer, Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), who returns to her homeland to assist a former comrade in his battle to seek justice for the dark past they share. What unfolds is a painful journey, with powerful testimonials and haunting memories, laying bare the reality of living in fear during the oppressive regime.|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford has ever made is The Searchers (1956). This masterpiece starring John Wayne is not only visually stunning, but it also deals with the depths of the human soul, exploring themes of racism, revenge, and the capacity for redemption. The landscape plays a crucial role, with Monument Valley almost becoming a character in its own right. The exquisite framing and camerawork throughout showcase Ford's distinct aesthetic, which transports viewers into the vast and brutal terrain of the American West.|0
"`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time while watching it. The fierce competition between contestants and the excitement of photoshoots never gets old. The drama, emotion, and surprises on set always leave you on the edge of your seat, anxiously waiting for what's coming next. Apart from pure entertainment, ""America's Next Top Model"" also educates and inspires those interested in fashion and modeling, making it both entertaining and informative. The top-notch mentors, from Tyra Banks to influential photographers and designers, add valuable input, creating a unique behind-the-scenes experience for viewers."|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me , this show transcends age and gender; it is simply a captivating and enjoyable series that has kept me hooked throughout. Over the years, I have eagerly awaited each new episode, immersing myself in the ever-evolving plotlines and relishing the growth of my favorite characters. This show not only sparks conversation with others who share my passion for it, but has also helped me develop valuable insights into complex themes and social issues presented.|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . The film serves as an eye-opening journey, delving deep into the complex psyche of a female protagonist, highlighting the destructive effects her insecurities can unleash on those around her. A powerful blend of suspense and psychological drama, the movie compels the viewer to ponder their own emotional vulnerability and how our weaknesses can have unforeseen consequences for ourselves and others. Undeniably thought-provoking, this cinematic experience will stay etched in the viewer's mind for a long time.|0
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should definitely bring it back and give the new generation of viewers a chance to appreciate it as much as we did growing up. There are not many films that hold up over time, but this one has a timeless charm and valuable life lessons. Nowadays, it feels like they don't make movies as meaningful and heartfelt as this classic. Reviving it on Disney Channel would not only provide quality entertainment for current viewers, but also reignite nostalgia for older fans.|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort in portraying a troubled detective navigating a web of deceit, crime, and unexpected plot twists. The film showcases an atmospheric setting that heightens the tension and mystery, giving the audience an immersive experience. However, some character arcs and plot developments can seem forced, undermining the otherwise thrilling narrative. Despite its flaws, The Killing Yard manages to maintain its momentum, thanks to a committed ensemble cast and carefully crafted suspense. Overall, the film provides an engaging experience worth exploring for fans of the crime-thriller genre.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost ' fame) unearths an ancient subterranean complex and unintentionally revives an army of deactivated robots.

The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for me, it encompasses a few important factors: balance, fulfillment, and contentment. The best of everything includes finding balance in all aspects of life - work, personal growth, relationships, and health. Striving for fulfillment by setting meaningful goals and seeking happiness in every endeavor, be it in our careers or hobbies. Lastly, embracing a sense of contentment by practicing gratitude for all that we have achieved and understanding that life will never be perfect.|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great slasher film that really captures the essence of the horror genre. From the suspenseful moments, chilling score, and talented acting, this film truly delivers on all aspects. Don't be swayed by some negative opinions, because it is clear that the filmmakers put their heart and soul into crafting an enjoyable and thrilling horror experience. Just Before Dawn masterfully builds tension while keeping viewers invested in the story, thanks to its engaging and complex characters.|0

In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to convince him that it's actually rabbit season, hoping that Elmer will go after Bugs instead of him. As part of his cunning plan, Daffy employs various tactics like swapping signs that say 'Rabbit Season' and 'Duck Season', and putting on disguises to trick Elmer into believing he's someone else. Meanwhile, Bugs, never one to be outsmarted, uses his quick wit to outwit both Daffy and Elmer at every turn.|0
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest Upon further exploration, however, one discovers that this movie transcends the overused tropes often found in typical 80s inbred/backwood slasher films. With a fresh approach to character development, storytelling, and gore, it brilliantly subverts the usual expectations and breathes new life into the subgenre. The director crafts tension and dread through atmosphere, weaving dark humor amidst genuinely terrifying moments. Dynamic visuals combined with a haunting score add to the thrilling experience, solidifying the film as an underappreciated gem within horror cinema.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen may not have had sufficient distance to critically assess the portrayal of her life. Nonetheless, the movie delves into the singer's struggles with fame, relationships, and her ultimate battle with anorexia. It offers an intimate glimpse into the ups and downs of The Carpenters' career and Karen's tumultuous relationship with her family. While the movie has faced some criticism regarding accuracy and portrayals of certain events, the intention was to raise awareness about eating disorders and honor Karen's talent and legacy.|0

The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series I've ever come across, it offers breathtaking footage and enlightening insights into the Earth's wildlife and ecosystems. From exploring the vast oceans and the vivid depths of the Blue Planet, to unearthing the undiscovered species in remote, hostile terrains, each episode leaves the audience astounded by the marvels of our planet. Sir David Attenborough's powerful storytelling and ability to explain complex scientific phenomena make these series accessible to everyone. Additionally, it serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of conserving our planet for future generations.|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , with subpar storylines and amateurish production quality. However, this weekend we decided to give local cinema another chance, hoping for some improvement. To our surprise, we discovered a small gem of a film that captivated us from the very beginning. The movie had well-rounded characters, a strong storyline, and surprisingly good special effects. Its cinematography was excellent, adding depth and enhancing the emotions it invoked. We found ourselves thoroughly entertained and reflecting on our newfound appreciation for local talent.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra and always raved about the incredible experience she had on set. Directed by an acclaimed filmmaker, the movie depicted the harsh realities and emotional turmoil faced by the people during the Civil War. It was brought to life by powerful performances, an outstanding script, and spectacular cinematography. Critics and audiences alike praised it for its gripping storyline, historical accuracy, and ability to stir raw emotions in even the most stoic viewer.|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two gether'. But I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. The film goes beyond its basic premise, showcasing a unique and compelling blend of romance, comedy, and genuine human emotions. The performances of the leads are nothing short of captivating, drawing viewers in with their charisma and vulnerability. Their relatable struggles, engaging conversations, and heartfelt moments drive the narrative in a way that feels entirely natural. So if you're in the mood for an unexpectedly enjoyable flick, 'Two-gether' just might be your next pick.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film , directed by Neil LaBute, is a clever and inventive dark comedy that manages to captivate and entertain from beginning to end.

Alongside an impressive ensemble cast, including Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, Nurse Betty brings a unique mix of drama, suspense, and satire, providing an escape from the usual clichés that tend to dominate summer cinema.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , so we decided to go and check it out. It turned out to be a pre-release of an upcoming movie which made us feel like exclusive guests. The movie turned out to be excellent with gripping story and fantastic performances. Atlanta's film scene was clearly thriving as there were other film enthusiasts buzzing about, discussing and providing insights. After the screening, we got a chance to attend a small Q&A with the director, adding to the whole unforgettable experience.|0

After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the sequel to be released.

Superb performances, along with visually stunning cinematography, come together seamlessly to create a captivating masterpiece. I believe this movie has set the bar high for filmmaking in years to come and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a must-watch for all cinephiles.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  a troubled protagonist struggling to find redemption amidst challenging circumstances – you might think it's just another overused plot. But the filmmakers breathe new life into this age-old tale by presenting it with remarkable ingenuity and refreshing nuances. Every twist feels entirely unexpected, making us reimagine what is truly original in storytelling. Exceptional performances combined with impeccable pacing propel the narrative, turning hackneyed situations into invigorating moments of emotional power.

The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the fast-paced energy essential to this 1939 crime drama film. Through skillful direction, Seiler effortlessly immerses the viewer in a world of cunning criminals and unyielding law enforcement, painting a rich tapestry of intrigue and suspense.

I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during a slow afternoon when I suddenly stumbled upon it. At first, I didn't think I'd like it, but I was instantly drawn in by the interesting plot and captivating characters. It was like stepping into a whole new world full of intrigue and excitement. As I continued to watch each episode, I realized that I had been missing out on this amazing show for years. Now, I find myself eagerly anticipating every new episode, discussing the storyline and character development with fellow fans online.|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot. In fact, it's an absolute mind-bender that keeps you guessing and questioning long after the credits roll. The convoluted plot seems intentionally designed to disorient and confound, taking audiences on an epic journey through time and space. The astounding visuals only serve to add to the captivating chaos, while the riveting performances draw you in even more. Like staring directly at the blazing sun, attempting to fully grasp this film will only result in squinting eyes and potential burnout.|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I just couldn't get into the storyline or connect with the characters at that time. However, recently, a friend of mine highly recommended the movie to me, mentioning that it was their all-time favorite. So, I decided to give it another try, thinking that perhaps I wasn't in the right headspace the first time I attempted to watch it. As I pressed play and settled in, I tried to remain open-minded and patient.|0
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into the movie with high expectations, given all the hype surrounding it, and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint! The twists and turns of the plot kept me on the edge of my seat, and the character development was just outstanding. The visuals were absolutely stunning and the sound effects totally immersive. As for the ending, it was as emotional and impactful as I had hoped it would be. Kudos to the actors and crew for their splendid work.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1

Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , especially when paired with the sassy Leah Remini, who plays his headstrong wife Carrie Heffernan. Their interactions together make the show consistently laugh-out-loud, showcasing both of their unique comedic skills. Supporting characters such as their unconventional neighbors and Doug's bumbling friends at IPS add to the humorous dynamic, creating quirky storylines with many side-splitting moments. Combined with expertly-written dialogue, well-executed physical comedy, and expert comedic timing, King of Queens has become an undeniable television classic, leaving audiences doubled over with laughter for over two decades.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders if he has forgotten to focus on the essence of the story itself. Characters and visuals are so deeply drenched in metaphor that they occasionally drown the genuine emotion of the narrative. Furthermore, the complex themes explored may leave some audience members feeling unsettled, questioning the true intention behind Brewer's vision. Although these narrative issues cannot be overlooked, there's no denying the powerful performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake that anchor the film.|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best adaptations of the classic tale, which keeps me captivated and entertained every time I watch it. The excellent casting, combined with the compelling screenplay and the astounding cinematography, bring the narrative to life in a visually stunning manner. The chemistry between the characters and the immersive historical atmosphere effortlessly draw me into the intricacies of the story. Not only does it stay true to the essence of the original literary work, but the miniseries also elevates it, taking viewers on a breathtaking and emotional journey.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of the city plastered on them, standing proudly amidst sprawling runways and bustling terminals. These symbols of modern aviation displayed both the vast scale of infrastructure, as well as the unity brought by interconnectivity, no matter the city size. Capturing various aircraft soaring above iconic destinations illuminated the very essence of air travel. It is more than just jet-setting and mile-high sights, but an ongoing narrative of places once distant, now tethered by human ingenuity and determination, fostering collaboration, globalisation, and personal experiences across myriad frontiers.|0

"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for historical epics, but this adaptation captivates me every time I watch it. Directed by Michael Curtiz, the film expertly showcases the grandiosity of ancient Egypt while remaining true to Waltari's masterpiece. The exceptional cinematography, magnificent set design, and powerful performances by Jean Simmons and Victor Mature are truly spellbinding. Furthermore, the sweeping storyline delves into love, betrayal, political intrigue, and self-discovery, all themes that resonate universally.|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their best, yet there is a certain nostalgic charm in witnessing their last performances together. Set in a picturesque post-war European backdrop, the storyline unravels the love triangle involving an aging actress, a charming pianist, and an opportunistic manager. With authentic 50's costuming and jazzy background score, the film is worth watching for enthusiasts who cherish classic romantic melodramas. Though marred by slightly overwrought acting and uneven pacing, the on-screen chemistry between Crawford and Jordan ensures an entertaining spectacle.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of an alluring seductress named Fathom. The movie itself was a fun, action-packed adventure set in exotic locales with a perfect blend of thrilling spy elements and campy humor. The supporting cast delivered great performances as well, especially Tony Franciosa, who portrayed a witty and charming hero alongside Raquel's mesmerizing character. Overall, the film boasts amazing cinematography and eye-catching wardrobe choices, making it a delightful feast for the eyes. It's no wonder that Fathom has achieved a well-deserved status as a classic, escapist treat from the '60s.|0
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air again? I absolutely need to watch it one more time! I wonder if any of the streaming platforms have it available in their catalogues, or maybe I could find it on digital platforms like Google Play or Amazon Prime. If those options fail, perhaps a classic DVD or Blu-ray from a local store could be the way to go! I'll start searching around, reach out to fellow fans, and even post about it on social media to gather information on how to bring this amazing movie back into my life.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd rather not discuss those parts. Nevertheless, this movie showcases moments of brilliance, captivating the audience with riveting performances and enthralling visuals. It manages to shine amidst some frustrating narrative decisions, highlighting the potential for a truly outstanding cinematic experience. However, inconsistency rears its ugly head, undermining the storytelling and taking viewers on a bumpy rollercoaster ride that is both enjoyable and exasperating. The highs overshadow the lows, but it's hard not to ponder what could have been if the film stayed consistent throughout.|0
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception. This gripping and intense crime thriller series, brought to you by the renowned British broadcaster, only elevates the standards we've come to love and expect. Boasting superb storytelling, compelling character development, and heart-stopping suspense, MESSIAH plunges us deep into the chaotic world of murder, secrets, and betrayal. Each episode leaves us not only hungry for more but also pondering on the human psyche and the disturbing extents to which people can go.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George 's deep-rooted friendship despite their differences in beliefs and upbringing. The film brilliantly depicted their strong bond as they navigated the hardships of life during the Civil War era. The amazing cast delivered exceptional performances, transporting the audience back in time, and the love triangle involving Orry, George, and Madeline added an extra layer of intensity to the plot. The movie was a true rollercoaster of emotions and left me appreciating the power of loyalty and friendship during challenging times.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the film's plot, which mentioned that it felt a little confusing and underdeveloped. While I understand that perspective, I personally felt that the intricacy and subtle nuances in the storytelling added a certain depth to the film that is rarely seen in today's cinema. Despite a few minor flaws, this movie excelled in immersing the audience in its well-crafted world, supported by powerful acting and striking visuals. It leaves you with thought-provoking questions and creates room for passionate discussion among viewers, making it an excellent film for movie aficionados.|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . The whole experience was amazing, as we all couldn't stop talking about the thrilling plot, breathtaking visuals, and engaging characters throughout. There were so many unexpected twists and turns that we were literally at the edge of our seats, devouring our popcorn. The remarkable special effects blew us away, making the film an absolute feast for the eyes. After the movie, we hit the nearby diner for a quick snack and couldn't resist dissecting every epic moment in detail.|0
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to thrilling action, intertwining suspense and character development seamlessly. The gripping storyline held my attention from beginning to end, showcasing a series of twists that had me constantly second-guessing myself. The actors delivered compelling performances, truly bringing the diverse and nuanced characters to life. The realistic dialogue allowed the audience to truly understand their motivations and emotional depth. Cinematography, meanwhile, complemented the tone and feel of the narrative, with attention to details that enhanced the immersive experience.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the film masterfully explores the anxieties, fears, and foibles of its protagonist, as he desperately navigates the challenges of dating, relationships, and dealing with the ever-daunting 'girl next door.' Brilliantly using visual gags and witty dialogues, the film weaves a tale that anyone who's ever faced the daunting task of talking to their crush can relate to. Boy Next Door provides its audience with equal parts empathy and laughter, as our bumbling hero struggles to make sense of his love life and, more importantly, himself.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character, who happens to be named Luck. Luck, an unassuming young man, embarks on an odyssey across the Australian Outback, crossing paths with an eccentric ensemble of outcasts and misfits. The diverse encounters allow him to reflect upon the challenges and triumphs that shaped his world. Shot amid the wild terrain and vast landscapes, Fuckland exudes raw realism, painting a bleak yet poetic picture of society's disenfranchised souls, all trying to forge their paths within an indifferent universe.|0
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I believe are important. In today's fast-paced world, we often overlook the value of empathy and human connections. People are getting more focused on their personal achievements, often neglecting their relationships and social interactions. Communication technology, while having various advantages, can never replace face-to-face conversations and meaningful interactions. So, let's all make a conscious effort to understand each other's perspective and be more compassionate, setting aside our judgments.|0
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an oldie but a goldie! This true classic comes from a time when erotica had a charm of its own - more storylines, seduction, and, surprisingly, it seems more realistic. This isn't like the content that is produced nowadays where everything seems to be overtly sensationalized. Rather, this was more about the slow burn, the palpable chemistry, the tantalizing situations, all culminating into a symphony of sultry experiences that take us back to those early days when we first dared to peek into the risqué world of pornography.|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed some of the details and layers that added to the brilliance of its storytelling). The immersive world, gripping narrative, and multifaceted characters left an indelible impression on my mind. I found myself deeply engrossed in each frame and astounded by the fine interplay of subtleties in both the visuals and the score. Beyond its technical prowess, the movie tapped into profound and thought-provoking themes that compelled me to ponder its deeper meanings. A remarkable work of art, it has earned a permanent spot on my list of favorites.|0
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of writing that has captured my attention from the start. This intense, captivating novel has kept me on the edge of my seat, taking me down a twisting path that never ceased to surprise me. The characters are fascinating, deeply developed, and almost feel uncomfortably real at times, drawing you deeper into their minds and the plot's labyrinth. The writing is enthralling and meticulously crafted, with just the right balance of suspense and shock, leading to a psychological exploration that is simply hard to put down.|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and dedication. This powerful and poignant film takes us on an unforgettable journey through the intricacies of a particular time in history, effortlessly shedding light on its long-lasting impact. The depth of research is astounding and it reflects in the immersive storytelling that unveils compelling accounts from primary sources, thoughtfully backed up by evidence. The raw emotions captured make the viewer feel empathetic and well-informed, with multiple perspectives creating an overarching understanding of the situation.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in Barcelona. The film expertly captures the unique challenges and unforgettable experiences that international students encounter as they embark on their Erasmus journey. Through the relatable, multidimensional characters, it highlights the difficulties of language barriers, adapting to a new culture, and the search for accommodation in an unfamiliar city. Moreover, the movie does an excellent job of demonstrating the significance of friendships formed and the beauty of diversity in such an environment.|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and the supporting cast. Instead, focus on the underlying themes and emotions presented throughout the film. Delving deep into the realms of friendship, loyalty, and personal struggle, this film captivates audiences and pulls at the heartstrings with a stunning narrative that transcends the events taking place on the surface. Coupled with a beautifully crafted visual style and evocative soundtrack, it ultimately delivers a profound cinematic experience that reminds us of our own vulnerabilities, our shared connections, and the often underestimated impact of human emotions in our lives.|0
"After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I came across ""Storm of Suspicion"" and knew I had to watch it. Meredith's performance in this suspense-filled drama was nothing short of fantastic. It was intriguing to witness the remarkable transformation from her innocent portrayal in ""Beyond the Prairie"" to a powerful, commanding presence in ""Storm of Suspicion."" Once again, Meredith succeeded in captivating the audience with her undeniable talent and convincing portrayal of a character entangled in a web of mystery and deceit."|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a ray of hope in this chaotic world. It's heartening to see that there are still individuals, like Aparnaji, who go out of their way to bring about positive change in the lives of the underprivileged. Such acts of selflessness remind us of the power of humanity, and show us that we can collectively make this world a better place. As more people come forward and engage in philanthropic endeavors like these, our collective strength grows, demonstrating the sheer importance of kindhearted individuals in restoring harmony to our society.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning to the very end. This search takes the audience through Mithi's emotional and psychological journey, as she relentlessly seeks a seemingly non-existent home. She remains confident that this mystical residence is where her true happiness and peace reside. Mithi, portrayed beautifully by Konkona, delves deeper into her subconscious and self-made reality as her determination intensifies. The viewers, while experiencing a gripping storyline, are also given a deeper insight into the delicate nature of the human mind and the overwhelming desire for solace and belonging.|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch Project or something. The acting is quite impressive, as the actors seem genuinely engrossed in their roles, making the audience feel truly invested in the story. Additionally, the editing is clean and smooth, allowing the film to progress seamlessly. The sound design and score effectively elevate the intensity, adding to the overall immersive experience. While the plot could benefit from a bit more development, it is still engaging and offers several surprising twists.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... Even for sci-fi, this movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little, it's a full-blown rollercoaster of bizarre concepts and outlandish ideas that will have your head spinning. Set in an alternate universe, with extraordinary creatures and inexplicable phenomena, it leaves audiences scratching their heads as they attempt to follow the twisting narrative. Blending reality with fantasy, it's an incredible fusion of advanced technology, improbable events, and impossible worlds.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I had the wonderful opportunity to attend a screening of this cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together the world of film and opera. The featured directors' diverse perspectives led to the creation of an innovative and visually striking tapestry, as each short brought its unique interpretation of the iconic arias. Emotion, passion, and intensity filled the auditorium as viewers were drawn into every story, experiencing the emotional nuances expressed through powerful vocal performances, engaging narratives, and artful cinematography.|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational ), that it almost seemed as though the chain was the star. But as viewers delve deeper into the story, it becomes evident that the film is about much more than just an attention-grabbing prop. This dark, psychological thriller unravels the hidden traumas of each character, where the infamous chain represents the inescapable hold the past has over them. Emotions and personal struggles collide, leaving audiences pondering the impact of destructive tendencies on relationships and, ultimately, on oneself.|0
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to show the world the incredible talent and culture our nation has to offer. This captivating masterpiece effortlessly highlights our nation's captivating landscapes and offers a true depiction of the richness of Colombian lifestyle. Tackling complex societal issues and promoting local folklore, the film presents a refreshingly honest and authentic portrayal of our people. The talented actors and filmmakers invite international audiences to explore and appreciate Colombia in a way they've never seen before.|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and intrigue that continuously leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. From heart-pounding action sequences to profound character development, this film explores various themes such as love, friendship, revenge, and forgiveness. The stunning visual effects and impeccable direction are complemented by a remarkable soundtrack that further immerses audiences into the intricately woven narrative. Ultimately, the thought-provoking nature and riveting plot twists of the film ensure a captivating cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands , this theme could easily have resulted in a cliched and one-dimensional portrayal. However, the nuanced storytelling skillfully delves into the various forms of abuse – emotional, physical, and psychological – offering a deeply layered and introspective look at the characters involved. By showing the intertwining dynamics between abusers and their victims, as well as the difficult paths towards healing, ""Jaded"" explores the intricacies of power and control, ultimately shining a light on the resilience and potential redemption for both parties involved."|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and engaging, yet still had a moral lesson woven into its plot. The vibrant animation and quirky characters captured my imagination and heart as a young child, making it a nostalgic masterpiece. These memorable episodes always provided endless entertainment and clever, thought-provoking storylines that stand the test of time. In today's world, where animation continues to push boundaries and technological advances, revisiting this cartoon classic reminds us that the magic lies in the characters, storytelling, and heartwarming lessons it delivers.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I can truly empathize with their emotions and connect with their struggles. For a love story to really resonate, there needs to be an underlying truth and depth to the characters, where their actions feel genuine and organic to their circumstances. Furthermore, a strong emotional build-up and gradual evolution of their relationship is essential for truly immersing myself in the narrative. Of course, unexpected twists, memorable chemistry between the characters, and some relatable challenges they have to overcome in pursuit of their love will seal the deal.|0
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this quote by Archbishop Desmond Tutu beautifully summarized the film's message on the significance of understanding and coming to terms with one's past. He said, ""In order to move forward, one must first confront their past, no matter how painful or buried it may be. Our history shapes who we are, and we must embrace it - flaws and all - in order to learn from it and truly grow. The human capacity for healing, forgiveness, and ultimately, transformation is remarkable."""|0
"That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything "" indeed! Set in the dramatic and twisted world of Hollywood, the show takes its viewers on a wild roller coaster of scandal, deceit, and sensational affairs. The manipulative yet irresistible protagonists strive to attain wealth, power, and success - stepping on any toes they need to in order to get to the top.

Grab a bag of popcorn and embrace the guilty pleasures of watching all that delicious chaos unfolding."|0

This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when it arrives at the devastated German capital. The once bustling and lively city now lies in ruins, a chilling testament to the destructive power of war. On board the train, a mix of soldiers, diplomats, and journalists journey together towards an uncertain future, the memories of the brutal conflict that has ravaged Europe still fresh in their minds. Conversations in hushed tones echo throughout the compartments as these individuals speculate on what the coming months and years will hold for a weary and battered Europe.|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to make their way through life, facing various challenges, and forging strong relationships with others around them. Their relatable struggles – be it in finding a stable source of income, overcoming past mistakes, or even building a family – resonated deeply, bringing to mind stories of resilience, adaptability, and redemption. Through each interaction, the Hookers navigated the complex tapestry of human relationships, extending empathy and kindness to the friends, families, and strangers they crossed paths with.|0
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Grable's performance was simply outstanding, capturing the essence of her character's depth and personality. The plot had an excellent mix of intrigue, drama, and wit, keeping the audience engaged from beginning to end. The visuals and cinematography were breathtaking, with a seamless fusion of various visual styles and a striking attention to detail. Supporting actors gave outstanding performances, creating an authentic ambiance that transported the audience into the film's world.|0
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was absolutely terrible. Considering the phenomenal acting, stunning visuals, and incredible storyline, I couldn't help but wonder what this individual found so off-putting. Was it just a matter of personal taste or perhaps this person just couldn't appreciate the underlying themes and artistry the film showcased? Even though opinions can greatly vary, I still strongly recommend giving this movie a chance for those who haven't watched it yet. Ultimately, it's up to the viewer to form their own conclusion and perspective on this cinematic gem.|0
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 1970s, and I must say, I was quite intrigued by the peculiar yet bold amalgamation of whimsical fantasy and erotic themes. Combining Lewis Carroll's iconic characters and story elements with risqué songs and performances created an oddly delightful, alternative exploration of Wonderland. Witnessing beloved childhood figures interact within the framework of this sensual production elicited a strong nostalgic intrigue. Strikingly contrasting against its initial innocence, the satire was a pleasantly chaotic blend of innocent wonder and salacious humor.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for `` Once Upon a Time in the West`` but could not, due to budget constraints. In this inventive scene, a mysterious gunman makes his grand entrance at a rowdy saloon. Upon his arrival, the piano falls silent, and tension is thick in the air. Each patron can't help but notice the danger that seems to follow this enigmatic stranger. Amidst this nerve-wracking atmosphere, it's impossible for viewers to look away as a volatile showdown unfolds.|0
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because everyone kept raving about it. Once I began watching, I was instantly hooked! The storyline is so compelling, with rich and diverse characters that you can't help but root for. The cinematography is truly spectacular, creating a visually stunning backdrop that complements the drama unfolding on-screen. The actors' performances are nothing short of phenomenal, as they successfully bring their complex characters to life. Even without cable, I highly recommend binge-watching this show, because it will quickly become a favorite of yours.|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . This visually stunning and expertly penned western by the experienced ""Rawhide"" mastermind Charles Marquis Warren transports audiences back in time through its exquisitely captured landscapes and captivating storytelling. Boasting dynamic character development, authentic dialogue, and thrilling action sequences, this masterwork manages to rise above the usual tropes of the genre. A standout feature in a sea of cliched cowboy narratives, Warren's incomparable vision and gripping storytelling prowess come together in a powerfully engaging film that promises to leave a lasting impression on all who immerse themselves in its stirring tale."|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice guy transforms into a larger-than-life superhero with powers and abilities beyond imagination. In this movie, the protagonist overcomes his self-doubts, embraces his newly-discovered skills, and learns valuable lessons about courage, responsibility, and self-sacrifice. As the superhero embarks on exhilarating adventures, he confronts deadly villains and complicated relationships, all while grappling with the challenges of leading an extraordinary life. This thrilling narrative coupled with spectacular special effects is sure to captivate and inspire viewers.|0
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , unrelated title!) Anyway, the story is captivating, funny, and engaging throughout, making for a genuinely entertaining experience. The characters are memorable, with the lead delivering an outstanding performance that truly makes the audience care about his journey. The scenery, set design, and visuals add another layer of enjoyment, fully immersing us into this fascinating world. Moreover, the director effectively infuses wit, heart, and emotion into every scene, creating a cohesive, memorable movie.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe , films tend to explore the complexities and nuances of human emotions and relationships, rather than relying on grandiose action sequences or extravagant special effects. In this movie, characters are developed with intricate subtlety, each with their unique shades and motives. Cinematic storytelling relies more on thought-provoking dialogues, soulful visuals, and introspective sequences, as it addresses pressing socio-political issues. With a focus on authenticity and artistic sensibilities, the film boldly defies typical Hollywood clichés and engages the audience intellectually and emotionally.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student community in Paris who navigate their way through a world of new friendships, academic challenges, and personal growth. Filled with colorful characters and hilarious, yet insightful situations, this hidden gem takes viewers on a delightful journey through the streets of the City of Lights. Whether it's facing the daunting professors or an unexpected romance, our young protagonists find a sense of camaraderie in their shared experiences, making this film a must-watch coming-of-age story.|0
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes during a film. The intense, gut-wrenching suspense and scares are perfectly intertwined with a rich, gripping storyline. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, filled with anticipation and dread as the horrifying events unfold before you. Brilliantly crafted with stellar performances, haunting atmosphere, and grisly imagery, this film pays homage to the classic horror films of the past, yet raises the bar to a whole new level. A word of caution: it's not for the faint-hearted or squeamish.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It captured our culture, essence, and spirit, and represented us in a positive and genuine light. Each character brought relatable stories to the table, reflecting our own struggles, triumphs, and passions, and making us feel seen and acknowledged. It emphasized the importance of community and the impact we make when we uplift each other. Beyond pure entertainment, this series was a beacon of hope, encouraging empowerment, self-awareness, and determination among the Black community.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few of them) simply have a different taste or just didn't invest enough time in understanding the complexity of the storyline and its characters. This show has a rich narrative and explores unique themes that one would not normally see in everyday television shows. The talented actors deliver strong and captivating performances which make it easy for viewers to connect with their stories. Don't be swayed by a couple of bad reviews, take the time to delve into the episodes and you'll be amazed by how quickly you're hooked.|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year. The daring themes and unapologetic portrayal of contentious topics piqued my curiosity, so I knew I had to watch it for myself. From the very first scene, I could sense that this was a movie that was meant to make the audience feel uncomfortable, pushing boundaries and challenging norms. The visceral imagery combined with the superb acting truly encapsulated the intended mood of provocation and dispute. However, as the film progressed, I began to understand the value in presenting such a controversial subject.|0

The 2000 psychological thriller ""The Cell"" follows a highly advanced virtual reality device, allowing the investigator Catherine Deane, played by Jennifer Lopez, to dive into the minds of others, especially those suffering from psychiatric disorders. She is tasked to explore the thoughts of a serial killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) after he falls into a coma, in order to save his latest victim."|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1

I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and she is from a neighboring country, Bulgaria. We first met during an international school event and instantly hit it off. We spent most of the night talking about our cultures, sharing stories and just enjoying each other's company. We've stayed in touch over the years and she continues to amaze me with her humor, intelligence and beauty. Even with the distance and different backgrounds, our bond grows stronger by the day.|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my friend, I reluctantly agreed. As we settled into our seats with a large tub of popcorn, I braced myself for a wasted afternoon. Surprisingly though, as the movie progressed, I found myself immersed in the intricate storyline and masterful acting. In the end, not only did I leave the theater thoroughly impressed and entertained, but I was also grateful for my friend's insistence. I learned to be more open-minded and not judge a film solely based on its promotions.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
"After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I purchased ""Gracie's Choice"" as I was intrigued by the storyline and I absolutely loved Meredith's portrayal of Gracie in it. It's safe to say that she has become one of my favorite actresses of all time. Meredith effortlessly brings emotion, strength, and determination to each character she plays. She has the uncanny ability to create empathy and understanding in her viewers while telling such a profound story. Her superb acting skills bring life to her films and never cease to leave a long-lasting impact on her audiences."|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's just too predictable. However, recently, I stumbled upon a new show that truly caught my attention. The well-developed characters, brilliant storylines, and impeccable acting genuinely impressed me. Unlike the typical, superficial series I usually avoid, this one delved deep into emotions and explored social issues without sugarcoating them or romanticizing the circumstances. With its honest portrayals and captivating plot twists, I found myself immersed and genuinely interested in seeing the story unfold. As a result, my preconceived notions about T.V.|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 /10 for the sheer depth of emotion and profound thoughtfulness it inspires in viewers. This cinematic experience truly transports you to a higher plane of intellectual engagement and provokes reflection on the larger existential questions. Brilliantly directed, accompanied by a riveting screenplay, and masterful cinematography, the film captivates you and lingers long after the final scene. Its combination of vivid imagery, exceptional acting, and captivating score results in an extraordinary exploration of the human experience that warrants its standing as a timeless masterpiece.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago. Finally getting the chance to watch the first MESSIAH, I can now appreciate the groundwork it laid for its sequel. Comparatively, the original has a darker, grittier tone, focusing more on the psychological elements than action scenes, allowing a richer understanding of the characters and their motives. Nevertheless, both installments offer an intriguing exploration of morality and vengeance. I now see MESSIAH 2 as a commendable expansion of its predecessor, adding its own twist, while retaining the essence of the first teleplay.|0
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could not have done a better job. The costumes are fabulous and the lighting design perfectly complements the overall performance. The talented cast brings a magnificent energy to the stage that leaves you mesmerized. Every song resonates deeply with your soul, and every dance routine seems to captivate the entire audience, allowing us all to escape from the daily stresses and feel truly inspired. If you haven't seen it yet, don't miss out on this one-of-a-kind, enchanting spectacle that has been garnering rave reviews worldwide.|0
"This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA This comment delves into ""North and South Book I,"" exploring the intricate dynamics of the 1842-1861 period. This phase of the 19th-century American history was marked by rampant industrial growth in the North, paired with a heavily agrarian society in the South, deeply rooted in slavery. Political ideologies often clashed as regional economies increasingly grew distinct, creating economic, social, and moral rifts between the two halves of the nation."|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
"I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and it has quickly become a cherished addition to my period drama collection. Featuring timeless classics like ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Emma,"" ""Mansfield Park,"" and ""Persuasion,"" this set offers a beautiful combination of outstanding performances, rich historical settings, and Austen's unforgettable romantic tales. These BBC adaptations truly capture the essence of the literary masterpieces and serve as a perfect escape to an era filled with elegance, passion, and drama."|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the entire film that didn't have a deeper meaning. Each character had their own complexities and intricacies, adding layer upon layer of symbolism to the narrative. The cinematography was a work of art; the scenes captured the emotions and intentions of the characters perfectly, acting as a mirror for their individual experiences. The movie also touched on several powerful themes such as redemption, friendship, and resilience against adversity. The soundtrack only further accentuated the emotionally intense moments and offered subtle auditory cues to signify significant plot shifts.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. The captivating storyline combined with stellar performances from actors like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown simply enthralled me. The unique blend of dark humour, suspense and gritty realism gave this Australian crime thriller a true authenticity. Even after all these years, I find myself revisiting the beautifully-captured world that Gregor Jordan so masterfully depicted. Although the Sydney presented in Two Hands is sometimes unforgiving and ominous, there remains an undeniable charm and unforgettable magnetism that I am absolutely grateful to have experienced.|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting the emotions that it intends to. The gentle soundtrack, combined with the warm and cozy art style, instantly envelops the viewer in a comfortable blanket of nostalgia, reminiscent of a quiet, simple childhood. As the story unfolds, we see the titular character indulging in the beautiful and innocent love for the simple joy of reading, taking the reader on a mesmerizing journey alongside their own childhood memories of books and vivid imaginations.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and experiences of modern-day America and those depicted in popular films. The documentary presents a compelling commentary on the societal and political values that have emerged within the United States over time. The movie thoughtfully weaves together different aspects of American life, including race, gender, socioeconomic status, and more. Through skillful editing and clever use of cultural and political clips, the documentary aims to expose how influential the film industry is in shaping American values.|0
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something that both of us could enjoy together. The captivating storyline, relatable characters, and witty humor managed to bridge the generation gap between us, sparking laughter and heartfelt conversation as the movie progressed. It felt refreshing to bond with my mother through a shared experience that appealed to our varied tastes, creating special memories for this holiday season. Not only did this make her Christmas gift feel extra meaningful, but it also made me appreciate these moments of togetherness even more.|0
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck ! Rabbit (1953), comprises a classic set of animated short films created by legendary animator Chuck Jones. These Warner Bros. masterpieces feature the witty, slapstick battles between popular characters - Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Elmer Fudd. Within each of these films, Daffy and Bugs engage in cunning acts of manipulation, continually tricking Elmer, who is desperately seeking a meal. Caught between warring sides, Elmer can't make up his mind which character to hunt – ducks or rabbits.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . In this episode, they caricature Al Gore's environmental activism by depicting him as overly dramatic and exaggerated. While it may offend some liberals, the intent of the show is to provide comic relief and satire, and the creators poke fun at a wide variety of subjects and individuals from different backgrounds. The idea is to entertain the audience and encourage critical thinking through humor, without causing undue distress. Ultimately, taking a comedic jab at a popular figure can reveal another layer of discourse in the complex web of public opinions.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show from the very first episode, and it keeps getting better and better with each new twist and turn in the plot. The characters are incredibly well-developed, making me feel a strong emotional connection with each of them. The storyline never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat, and the humor thrown into the mix balances it all out perfectly. The visuals and special effects are truly spectacular, only adding to the overall immersive experience of this fantastic show.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and at the same time, it's an unexpected adventure that takes viewers through the unpredictable twists and turns of modern Colombian culture. The storyline follows a quirky cast of characters whose seemingly ordinary lives intersect in fascinating ways, bringing to light the intricacies of human relationships, trust, and deceit. With its witty dialogue, innovative visual style, and satirical humor, Bluff transcends conventional Colombian cinema and has garnered positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.|0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw it on a recommendation from a friend, and I was not disappointed. The documentary offers a thought-provoking perspective on the complexities of modern families, love, commitment, and societal expectations that many couples face. It presents authentic and genuine conversations from both conventional and unconventional families that leave a lasting impression. Moreover, the unbiased nature of the presentation allows the viewer to make their judgments, inciting self-reflection on personal values and views on relationships.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a troubled young woman named Rae, who is grappling with personal demons and a tumultuous past. A chance encounter brings her into the life of Lazarus, an older, reclusive musician played by Samuel L. Jackson. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, the two form a bond and embark on a journey towards redemption and healing. Throughout the film, both Rae and Lazarus navigate their pasts, facing and reconciling with their emotional pain.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking about how hilarious it was. The comedic timing and quirky dialogue were absolutely spot-on. And who could forget that hilarious catchphrase?! Every time I hear someone mention it, I can't help but burst into laughter. Honestly, they outdid themselves this time with this wildly imaginative and relatable character. I don't think I've ever connected with an animated personality this much. This just proves, once again, that the creative minds behind Adult Swim are some of the best in the animation and comedy industry.|0
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it again and you'll notice little details that you might have missed on your initial viewing. It challenges your mind with its thought-provoking themes and brilliantly structured narrative. Some viewers might find it confusing, but the payoff for investing time and attention is absolutely worth it. So give this cinematic gem a chance and let yourself immerse in its complex storyline. With a stellar cast and expertly directed sequences, it will not disappoint.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years ! Yes, it's true; Leonardo da Vinci's famed painting was stolen on August 21, 1911. The theft shook the art world, resulting in immense public outrage and creating sensational headlines. A little-known Italian carpenter, Vincenzo Peruggia, managed to smuggle the painting out of the Louvre Museum in Paris concealed beneath his clothing. The masterpiece went unnoticed until December 1913, when it was discovered in Peruggia's apartment in Florence, Italy.|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but a brilliant ensemble cast that brings depth and authenticity to the story. Set in the picturesque American frontier, this film captures the raw beauty of the wild west while telling a compelling tale of rugged individuals facing insurmountable odds. At its core, this is a story of camaraderie, resilience, and honor, portraying the importance of loyalty and friendship during troubled times. The exceptional cinematography combined with an immersive narrative delivers an enthralling experience, transporting viewers to a different era.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch all the hilarious jokes I missed the first time around. The witty humor, fantastic visuals, and well-timed jokes create a fun and enjoyable viewing experience for audiences of all ages. The actors have incredible comedic chemistry, and it really brings out the best in each scene. What truly makes the film outstanding is its ability to weave comedy and heart-warming moments, creating a perfect balance that keeps the viewer entertained and emotionally invested.|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the theater and honestly, I wasn't expecting much from it. However, to my surprise, it was quite the emotional roller coaster. The plot had unexpected twists and turns that left me gripping my seat with anticipation. The acting was stellar, which brought every character to life with a unique sense of depth and vulnerability. Before I knew it, I found myself shedding a few tears and laughing along with the crowd.|0
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and demand that they release it for purchase immediately. This is an iconic movie that holds a special place in many people's hearts, and it is beyond disappointing that we cannot own it. Disney must acknowledge the fan base this movie has gathered over the years and do justice to both its artistry and its impact by allowing us to proudly support and enjoy it in our own collections. It's high time we use the power of social media and come together to let our voices be heard!|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to collect a package from a local dealer, Joey ( Richard Roxburgh ), in exchange for clearing his outstanding gambling debt. While Jimmy thinks it's a smooth errand, complications arise when he unexpectedly falls in love with Alex ( Rose Byrne ), a woman entwined in the city's criminal underworld. As he gets deeper into this dangerous situation, Jimmy begins to question his loyalties and trustworthiness, as both sides play a cat-and-mouse game.|0
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1

"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with an apt comparison. The movie presents such an exceptional fusion of unique storytelling, unparalleled visuals, and evocative performances that it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Even days after watching it, I find myself reflecting on its thought-provoking themes and riveting twists. Its individuality becomes its strongest asset, compelling moviegoers to expand their own perceptions of what film can offer. As it challenges boundaries and dares to explore new territories in the cinematic world, it etches a distinguished place for itself within the genre.|0
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds to new perspectives and encouraged them to break stereotypes. This show brilliantly used humor as a means to enlighten and empower teenagers, teaching them valuable life lessons through relatable situations and diverse characters. In a time when there's often negativity and pessimism, Up And Coming stood out by fostering personal growth, fostering a growth mindset, and promoting healthy communication within families and among friends. As the characters navigated their challenges with courage and integrity, the viewers were inspired to be resilient, compassionate, and ambitious in their own lives.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry productions, which showcased his love for the wild western frontier. 'Wagon Master' was released in 1950, highlighting a gripping narrative revolving around two charismatic horse traders guiding a group of Mormon settlers through the harsh desert to establish a new settlement in a promising location. Despite the previous Indian-cavalry productions experiencing major success, Ford insisted on shifting gears with 'Wagon Master' by placing human courage, camaraderie, and determination at the center stage.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have ever watched. From the gripping storyline to the exceptional performances by the actors, Messiah: The First Killings managed to hold my attention from the very beginning until the last minute. The show expertly balances suspense, action, and mystery, giving viewers a rollercoaster of emotions as they try to unravel the complexities of the plot. Moreover, the cinematography and setting further elevate the show's production value, adding to the overall captivating experience.|0
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm glad I decided to give it a chance. The storyline had me hooked from the start and kept me engaged throughout. It follows a fast-paced, intricate plot full of unexpected twists and turns, never once resorting to the usual cliches often found in such TV movies. The acting was solid and credible, with the actors bringing depth to their respective roles. Excellent camera work and visuals contributed to the overall suspenseful atmosphere.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the familiar pattern of a determined detective chasing a twisted, vicious predator. While it's commendable for attempting to elevate the genre through clever narrative devices and stunning visual techniques, ultimately, it fails to completely break free from its overused tropes. One can't deny the riveting performances and an intense, heart-pounding atmosphere, yet the novelty quickly wears thin as we encounter a typical cat-and-mouse chase filled with nail-biting close calls and unforeseen twists.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress Susie Q is a delightful romantic prom movie that effortlessly pulls at your heartstrings. With the lovely Amy Jo Johnson in the lead role of Susie Q, she captures the essence of youth, beauty, and endearing charm effortlessly. As she graces the screen, Amy transports you into a tale of unforgettable love, adding life and vitality to the captivating storyline.

I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows in every aspect of the final product. From the intricate script to the exceptional cinematography, each scene portrays a gripping story that had us all fully committed and passionate. The dedicated cast and crew worked tirelessly to breathe life into every character, and the genuine on-screen chemistry adds another layer of depth and realism to the tale. Together, we managed to explore powerful themes and create unforgettable moments that, as a director, brought my vision to life in a profoundly impactful way.|0
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
"-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a film that manages to both excite and disappoint. The talented actress Carla Gugino carries the movie on her capable shoulders with an impressive and captivating performance, winning over the audience with her undeniable screen presence. However, despite the compelling storytelling throughout the majority of the film, it unfortunately falters during the climactic moments. The unsatisfying conclusion leaves a feeling of emptiness as the credits roll. Ultimately, ""Jaded"" is worth watching for Gugino's memorable portrayal, but viewers should prepare themselves for the underwhelming finale."|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines several elements such as comedy, drama, action, and suspense. The film effortlessly weaves together the story of its main protagonist, Jimmy, as he navigates through a perilous underworld in a desperate quest for redemption. Driven by superb performances, memorable characters, and witty dialogue, this unique film captures the distinctive and vibrant culture of Sydney in a quirky yet engaging manner. Showcasing Australia's idiosyncrasies with endearing ease, Two Hands offers an exhilarating and refreshing spin to the genre that appeals to audiences worldwide.|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air. The show masterfully blends wry humor with a witty and realistic depiction of married life, effortlessly balancing laughs and relatable situations. The exceptional chemistry between the lead actors, Kevin James and Leah Remini, creates an undeniable charm and genuineness that other sitcoms simply can't achieve. Surrounding these stellar performances is a well-rounded ensemble cast and solid writing, infusing each episode with memorable moments and unforgettable one-liners.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have found it in The most beautiful film. A compelling narrative and stunning visuals come together seamlessly in this cinematic masterpiece, truly elevating the standards for cinema and leaving audiences speechless. Boasting incredible acting from a powerhouse cast, every character resonates deeply, enabling viewers to invest emotionally and experience each moment through their eyes. Profound life lessons and relatable experiences abound, presenting a thought-provoking exploration of human emotion, growth, and transformation.|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . We were absolutely captivated by the exceptional storytelling and remarkable performances throughout. The cinematography was stunning, as it effectively captured the raw emotions and beautiful sceneries that only served to enhance the storyline. Not only did this film transport us through the range of emotions felt by the characters, but it also stirred heartfelt discussions within our group long after we had left the theater. We couldn't help but appreciate how the Film Festival exposed us to such a powerful and unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Charlie, who creates a high-tech collar that can translate the thoughts and feelings of animals. He decides to adopt a motley crew of pets, including a charismatic dog named Milo, a witty cat named Sassy, and a charming yet mischievous parrot named Polly. This adventure-filled family flick is packed with heartfelt moments and a gripping storyline as Charlie and his newfound animal friends use their newly gained communication skills to stop a scheming billionaire from pursuing a sinister agenda that could endanger countless furry lives.|0
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that the overall experience of watching it was thoroughly engaging and visually captivating. The set design and costumes transported me to another era, while the cast delivered memorable and emotional performances. Despite potential deviations from historical records, this production highlights themes such as love, power struggles, and societal expectations that remain relatable today. Even without complete certainty of its historical or literary fidelity, the impact of this production resonates and stimulates thoughtful reflection on the complexity of human experiences throughout history.|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his favorite adult magazines, while I browsed through the steamy romance novels. At first, I felt hesitant, even embarrassed to be there, but it became our secret indulgence, a place we could openly explore our fantasies together. It was an unexpectedly fun and intimate bonding experience. However, what mattered the most to us was having open communication about our desires and curiosities in our relationship. By facing potential insecurities and fostering trust with each other, our relationship became deeper and our love even stronger than before.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . This engaging cinematic experience brilliantly weaves together themes of love, female empowerment, office dynamics, infidelity, and stylish allure. Viewers are taken on an emotional rollercoaster as the storyline delicately intertwines these relatable issues, portraying the multi-layered challenges faced in both personal and professional settings. Audiences will find themselves deeply invested in the unfolding relationships, sympathizing with the protagonists as they navigate the complexity of their lives, and dazzled by the glamorous fashion that seamlessly infuses elegance into every frame.|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's passing and continued to make such great content. The depth and passion with which he tackles his subjects are truly inspirational. The behind-the-scenes insights give us an extraordinary look into the creative process, while also touching on important themes like family, determination, and the power of storytelling. The emotions felt while watching are raw and real. Overall, it's a stunning and emotional tribute not only to his mother, but also to the art of filmmaking itself.|0
"This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , keeps you guessing until the end. The story features Simon Templar, a.k.a. ""The Saint,"" who effortlessly combines wit, charm, and intelligence as he sets out to solve yet another baffling mystery. In this installment, we find Templar drawn into a dangerous web of international espionage and ruthless villains. Along the way, there are the expected twists and turns that we've come to expect from a Saint adventure."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and experiences found across the diverse tapestry of the United States and how they intersect with elements of the film industry. From the glitz and glamour of Hollywood to the hardworking small-town American theaters, this movie explores the relationships people have with the art of storytelling. Through insightful interviews and emotive scenes, viewers get to witness the importance of representation, as well as how communities bond over their love of cinema. The resulting narrative demonstrates that beyond mere entertainment, movies play an important role in defining the collective identity of the country.|0
"`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure but rather for providing a dark and realistic exploration of the underlying themes of power, abuse, and manipulation. It delves into the complexity of human emotions and interpersonal relationships, ultimately exposing the psychological impact that traumatic experiences have on the characters. The intention is not to arouse but to shock, awaken and promote discussion about uncomfortable topics. As such, classifying ""Jaded"" as an erotic thriller not only misrepresents its central focus but also diminishes its poignant commentary on such issues."|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. Set during the tumultuous years of World War II, the story follows the lives of three people who were brought together by fate, a complex love triangle marked by the scars of the past, while grappling with an uncertain future. Despite the obvious tragedy in the background, the beauty of the relationship dynamic is what lingers after watching the film. One particular scene which captured both despair and hope stayed with me, even inspiring my outlook on life.|0
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White girl dance scenario, Brewer has gone for a raw and realistic portrayal of Southern American life that dives headfirst into themes like race, relationships, poverty, and perseverance. Craig Brewer’s coming-of-age narrative interlaces these core elements, presenting viewers with a striking and heartfelt film. Set amidst the backdrop of a sultry Tennessee landscape, the story revolves around the rich tapestry of life and everyday struggles faced by both Black and White characters.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's in the streets of Paris. I felt nostalgia and an overwhelming connection to the film's portrayal of our rebellious youth and naive enthusiasm. The intertwining stories of love, friendship, and self-discovery, painted on the vibrant backdrop of the era, encapsulated my own experiences beautifully. It brought to light that perfect mix of hope and trepidation we faced, as we traversed between who we were and who we were to become.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , the lead vocalist, was in top form as he belted out the iconic lyrics and carried the crowd through a thrilling setlist. The band was truly cohesive and managed to breathe new life into their timeless hits, incorporating powerful guitar solos and showcasing the sheer musicianship they've cultivated throughout their three-decade journey. From die-hard fans singing every word to first-timers who couldn't help but dance, the infectious energy resonated throughout the entire venue.|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you appreciate a well-structured storyline, rich visuals, and memorable performances from the cast, then this film deserves your attention. The pacing may have been slower than most blockbusters, but it allowed the movie to breathe, providing the characters with an opportunity to develop, thus immersing us more into the narrative. The emotional undertones were skillfully delivered, generating an experience that left an impact well beyond the theatre. Cinematography and soundtrack were top-notch as well.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
"I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John, whose unique tunes captured the essence of youthful spirit, hope, and friendship in the early '70s. The movie followed two teenagers on their emotional journey through love, loss, and coming of age, with John's music encapsulating each poignant moment. As the titular song, ""Friends"", reverberated through scenes, the hauntingly beautiful melody interwoven with tender lyrics made me believe in the enduring power of connection."|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that I've decided to give one a chance. My friend, who has a passion for Scandinavian cinema, highly recommended this particular film, claiming that it is an emotional masterpiece. To my surprise, not only was it absolutely moving, but it has become one of my all-time favorites. This Swedish movie combined brilliant storytelling with mesmerizing visuals and a captivating score. The film felt raw, relatable, and depicted deep emotions of love, despair, and forgiveness in a truly mesmerizing fashion.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three prosperous ranchers in the wild frontier. Disguised as weary cowboys, they traverse rugged mountains, narrow canyons, and harsh desert terrain while constantly watching for danger. On the outskirts of Rattlesnake Pass, they discovered a notorious, weathered saloon where members of the deadly gang frequented, indulging in cheap whiskey and crooked poker. Meticulously planning a swift attack, The Lone Ranger & Tonto lurk in shadows waiting for the perfect moment to expose the deadly band, enact retribution for the fallen, and reinstate order in the troubled region.|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice though, and from what I can tell, it is a brilliant piece of cinema. The cinematography and acting are truly exceptional, and the story had me hooked right from the start. The editing seemed well-executed, seamlessly weaving different scenes and subplots together. Despite missing out on the full experience, the shortened version did an excellent job of conveying the depth of the characters and the intensity of the film's major themes.|0
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? I definitely find myself yearning for those nostalgic moments, when Disney classics like The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin not only provided awe-inspiring visuals, but also masterfully told stories that had heart, depth, and meaning. The artistry behind their hand-drawn animation conveyed a unique sense of warmth and emotion that transcended age, speaking to both children and adults alike. Though today's Disney movies have their charm, there's a certain magic of the good old days that will forever remain unrivaled.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio working on a new track. Karen, the iconic vocalist, and her brother Richard, an incredibly talented pianist and composer, share a remarkable chemistry in their performance. The melody flows with flawless precision, showcasing their unique ability to connect on a musical level. Richard creates exquisite harmonies with the piano, while Karen's angelic voice envelopes each note with undeniable grace. It's as though you can see their dedication to perfection woven into the very fabric of their music.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways , it surpasses expectations by delivering an engaging storyline, captivating visuals, and strong performances by its cast. The cinematography and direction are on-point, which allows the audience to become fully immersed in the movie's rich world. Moreover, the writing explores deep themes, creating a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. Don't be deceived by its modest rating – give this underrated gem a watch and you'll likely find it to be a refreshing surprise that exceeds conventional notions of a typical 7-rated movie.|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I think the creators have done an exceptional job in balancing these elements to keep the audience captivated. The cast's impeccable chemistry truly brings the storylines to life, and their skillful portrayals keep viewers emotionally invested. Furthermore, the clever and often witty writing contributes to its overall appeal. The relatable themes explored throughout the episodes keep me coming back for more. In summary, this show is a remarkable amalgamation of emotion, laughter, and powerful storytelling that has resonated with many and left us craving the next episode.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
"`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband Michael, survived a traumatic experience several years ago. Despite undergoing therapy and moving to a new home, the nightmares have remained persistent. For the Fairlies, these dreadful slumbers seem impossible to escape from, disrupting their sleep and impacting their mental well-being. Michael describes the experience as being haunted by memories that constantly remind them of their misfortune. ""It feels as if we're fighting an invisible monster, slowly eroding the sense of peace and normalcy we've tried to build over time,"" he explains."|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the talented cast of rugged actors brings a genuine and gritty authenticity to the screen. The intense focus on realism puts the viewer right in the middle of the action, making every rope toss and bucking bronco all the more exciting. The dialogue is delivered in raw, no-nonsense vernacular, providing a vivid snapshot of a lifestyle rooted in history, struggle, and camaraderie. Through powerful character arcs, heart-stopping action sequences, and immersive atmosphere, this Rodeo Western truly brings to life the wild west we've only heard legends about.|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe it's best to let them experience the intriguing phenomenon for themselves. Fata Morgana is a complex form of mirage that occurs when light is refracted by layers of air with varying temperatures. In simpler terms, it creates optical illusions, bending light in such a way that objects may appear distorted, elongated, or even duplicated. Often seen near the horizon, Fata Morgana can create eerie, ghostly visions of distant objects like ships, coastlines, or islands, leaving witnesses amazed or perplexed.|0
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends & Neighbors ) takes a detour into dark comedy, exploring the unpredictability and bizarre nature of human connections. Showcasing a stellar ensemble cast, including Renée Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, and Greg Kinnear, the movie is filled with unexpected turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Fusing themes of obsession, violence, and celebrity culture, Nurse Betty tells a compelling story about identity, loneliness, and ultimately finding hope in the midst of chaos.|0
"I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time I watch one of his films, I can't stop laughing! ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Spaceballs"" – all are masterpieces of his wild imagination and brilliant sense of humor. Brooks has a unique ability to push the envelope, playfully subvert genre tropes and make us both think and laugh at the same time. He often walks a fine line between absurdity and satire but somehow, he always finds the right balance to create iconic parodies."|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . Fuckland explores provocative themes and delivers an authentic representation of raw human emotions through the unique Dogma filmmaking style. Although the movement gradually faded, it significantly contributed to breaking industry standards, paving the way for more unconventional cinema experiences. Looking back, it is worth rediscovering such captivating and fearless storytelling which challenged societal norms and ultimately captured the essence of being human in its rawest form. Perhaps modern filmmakers could embrace some of its bold concepts for continued growth and evolution in storytelling today.|0
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' and since then, my love for this charming, quirky film hasn't waned. The film revolves around the character, Betty Sizemore, brilliantly played by Renée Zellweger, a small-town waitress with a wild imagination. After witnessing a brutal crime, Betty enters a delusional state and pursues her dream of becoming a nurse on her favorite soap opera. The standout ensemble cast, which includes Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, and Greg Kinnear, delivers heartfelt and hilarious performances that contribute to the film's captivating balance of comedy and drama.|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a soap opera character, Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear. Her humdrum life takes a dramatic turn when her no-good husband, Del, becomes involved with drug dealers and gets brutally murdered. Stunned and disoriented, Betty sets off on a journey to California to meet her crush, unaware of the fictitious nature of Dr. Ravell. On her path, Betty inadvertently becomes tangled up in Del's shady affairs as the drug dealers chase her down, suspecting she might know the whereabouts of their missing stash.|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement As the treacherous journey pressed on, the cowpokes displayed their mastery of the land by navigating through the difficult terrain. Unbeknownst to all, a shared bond developed between them and the Mormons; their connection defying their unique backgrounds. While navigating through vast stretches of scorching deserts, rocky hills, and seemingly endless forests, a kinship was forged. They taught the settlers about water and food conservation while discovering common values and a common destiny.|0
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
"spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with the compelling drama, ""Posse."" The film featured an ensemble cast including Van Peebles, Stephen Baldwin, Charles Lane, Tone-Loc, and Pam Grier. ""Posse"" addressed issues of race, discrimination, and violence in America by showcasing a predominantly African-American group of outlaw cowboys in the post-Civil War era. The storyline weaved an important message of camaraderie and fighting against oppressive forces. This captivating Western struck a chord with audiences for its engaging plot, vivid visuals, and poignant social commentary that resonated throughout the '90s."|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
"If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a woman, kidnapping, and an absolutely inhumane way of torturing people, you need not look further. You must be thinking, how could someone make such a tasteless, gratuitous and gruesome film that glorifies such repulsive elements? How did this make its way onto cinema screens? While the creators might argue about shedding light on serious issues or providing ""pure"" entertainment, viewers often raise concerns about the consequences that consuming such visuals has on people's psyches and what message it sends out to our society."|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and it definitely made an impact on me. The storyline, coupled with its brilliant performances and exceptional visuals, made it a memorable experience that has stuck with me through the years. As the years passed and my perspective evolved, I began to appreciate even more the deeper themes that this film addresses. Now, I consider this movie as not only a coming-of-age moment in my life but also a classic that explores universal human emotions and the complexity of the world around us.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than the rest. Its captivating storyline, impeccable cinematography, and brilliant performances left a lasting impression. The use of visual metaphors, intriguing characters, and skillful direction set this film apart from its counterparts. The emotional depth it conveyed in such a short duration truly reflected the creator's talent and artistic vision. The harmonious blend of artistic expression and engaging narrative delivered a truly unique viewing experience, which continued to resonate with me even long after the screen had faded to black.|0
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld and Friends – two absolute titans of the sitcom genre. Viewers have such strong associations with and expectations from those two legendary series that it becomes difficult for a new show to really create its own niche and shine. As a result, the show often faces inevitable comparisons that tend to downplay its unique flavor, humor, and nuanced characters. Furthermore, modern audience preferences have evolved towards more dramatic and layered storylines, contributing to the show's lack of critical recognition.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the season finale, which I'm eagerly anticipating), I have to say that this particular episode managed to stand out in the best way possible. It has cleverly intertwined multiple storylines, incorporated heartwarming moments, and showcased some incredible acting, setting a high benchmark for future episodes. Moreover, the impeccable timing and hilarious one-liners in the dialogues just kept the laughs rolling, resulting in an enjoyable TV experience overall.|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this situation. Ever since we first crossed paths, your perspective and approach towards life have left me mesmerized. You have a special talent for understanding, assessing, and untangling complex matters, which I both admire and envy. Whenever I find myself in doubt or facing tough decisions, your unwavering support and unique point of view offer the guidance I seek. Our love strengthens me in unimaginable ways, and as our journey together unfolds, I'm grateful that we share the incredible bond that we do.|0

"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another mindless sitcom. However, after hearing some rave reviews from friends, I decided to give it another shot. And boy, was I wrong with my initial judgement! With brilliantly developed characters, witty writing, and strong performances, this show quickly became a staple in my television watching schedule. The humor is not only smart and sharp but also refreshingly inclusive, bringing forth timely social commentary and touching emotional moments. Moreover, the diverse ensemble of characters provide engaging and relatable storylines, catering to different age groups and backgrounds.|0
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical release of the film, complete with all its stunning visuals and iconic sound effects! I couldn't have asked for a more authentic experience - it felt as though I was in the cinema, transported right back to when the film first premiered. The packaging and special features included in the DVD were definitely an added bonus, as they gave a delightful, in-depth insight into the making of the masterpiece. Overall, a must-have addition for any film buff or fan of this cult classic.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the film, Betty, an unhinged nurse played by Renée Zellweger, becomes infatuated with a soap opera star played by Greg Kinnear. Her dangerous fixation causes her life to spiral into a chaotic and potentially lethal mix of fantasy and reality. This delusional trajectory propels her to abandon her monotonous life in search of Kinnear, leading her into the grim underbelly of criminal networks, which ultimately forces her to confront the blurred line between the lives we dream and the existence we truly face.|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity . This film has depicted the various nuances of media influence, thereby prompting the viewer to reassess the assumptions made about public figures based on limited, often skewed, information. With engaging narratives and well-researched anecdotes, it showcases the many sides of a celebrity that might otherwise be overlooked, encouraging viewers to critically analyze sensational stories presented by the media. Moreover, it reveals the mechanisms employed by news agencies and tabloids that carefully manipulate public sentiment and encourages a healthy skepticism when consuming information.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time , we're treated to a lackluster adaptation with an inconsistent storyline and poorly developed characters. Gone is Austen's trademark irony and poignant critique of societal norms. Instead, we have awkward pacing, overacted performances, and clumsy attempts at humor. The production values also fall flat, with uninspired set designs and unimaginative costume choices. Ultimately, this movie will leave Austen aficionados sorely disappointed and casual viewers simply bored. One can only hope that the next retelling of this classic can truly do justice to the revered author's talent.|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't aim to be like them. Posse brought a fresh perspective to the genre by showcasing the diverse backgrounds and narratives often overlooked in traditional westerns. It brilliantly explores themes of racism and identity through compelling, well-developed characters that reflect the real diversity of the American West. Though not perfect, Posse breaks barriers and brings more representation to the table, breathing life into a genre known for repetitive clichés. While it might not win awards alongside western classics, Posse still holds its own and resonates with many viewers today.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1

I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional disturbance and mental illness. Finally, I decided to give it a try, expecting melodrama and unrealistic portrayals of psychiatric conditions. Surprisingly, I was proven wrong. The film's refreshing, nuanced perspective took me on an emotional journey, deeply touching my heart. It provided an authentic portrayal of living with schizophrenia, with exceptional performances from the actors. The raw display of humanity and mental health not only changed my outlook on such issues but also encouraged me to be empathetic towards others struggling with their battles.|0

GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
"Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of ""Style over substance. But what a style it is. 'The Cell' is the internal version of a psychedelic fashion show with breathtaking visuals and imaginative imagery. This mind-bending sci-fi thriller, takes the viewers into the vivid dreamscapes and subconscious of its enigmatic characters. While some might criticize the film for favoring stunning aesthetics over a more developed narrative, there's no denying the intoxicating and memorable appeal of the overall design."|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing, unable to sleep due to jet lag, and this hidden gem appeared before our bleary eyes. Drawn in by the intrigue of its obscure premise, we settled on this unexpected journey of independent cinema. This low-budget masterpiece had no famous stars, but the characters were complex and surprisingly authentic. As we followed their unconventional storyline, each twist left us eagerly craving more, not unlike a nighttime infomercial pulling you into a product you never knew you needed.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of that combines action, comedy, and romance seamlessly.

All in all, this unique movie-watching experience is something I won't soon forget.|0
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of this film. It's not just a shallow romantic comedy meant for empty entertainment, but a meaningful exploration of relationships, emotions, and personal growth. Perhaps it takes a certain level of empathy or life experience to fully appreciate the subtleties presented, and I urge those who may have dismissed it too quickly to give it another chance. Understanding the deeper themes embedded in the narrative allows one to fully experience the significance of the movie and truly appreciate its powerful message.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Master' directed by Anthony Mann. Both movies defied the traditional conventions of Western genre, setting them apart from their contemporaries. In 'The Gunfighter,' we see the complex and vulnerable protagonist, portrayed by Gregory Peck, grappling with his reputation as the fastest gun alive, searching for redemption amidst growing tension from those who seek to take his place. Meanwhile, 'Wagon Master' explores the complexities of diverse groups brought together in the journey West.|0
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that this would be just another average independent film, but I was pleasantly surprised. The performances by the entire cast were fantastic and the storyline captivated me from the very beginning. Visually, it was a treat to watch – with excellent cinematography, breathtaking scenery, and superb attention to detail. What really struck me was the incredible mixture of emotions throughout the film. It managed to make me laugh, cry, and think – all in a span of about two hours.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , intriguing, and brilliantly crafted with an unusual plotline that kept audiences on their toes. The perfect balance of comedy and drama truly elevated the entire film. The characters, led by Morgan Freeman, Renée Zellweger, and Chris Rock, each portrayed their roles with immense depth, allowing the viewer to genuinely feel empathy and connection to them.

This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises .

"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1

"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it was the original epic that paved the way for these great films – ""The Silent Saga."" This monumental classic took the world by storm as it weaved a breathtaking tale set in the ancient times, teeming with fascinating stories of legendary heroes, forbidden love, and unthinkable treachery. Hailed as a cinematic triumph, its groundbreaking special effects, sweeping landscapes, and unforgettable performances helped define a golden age in movie history."|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just another typical American drama series, and I felt I would not be interested in its content. However, one day I found myself at a friend's house, who happened to be a big fan, and ended up giving in and watching a few episodes. To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The witty dialogues, genuine bond between mother and daughter, and unique charm of the small town of Stars Hollow eventually captivated me.|0

"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a young woman struggling to make sense of the modern world, finding herself spiralling down into the familiar rabbit hole of adulting. Embroiled in societal pressures, Alice encounters a motley crew of outlandish characters who exemplify different facets of contemporary society – be it self-image, career choices or relationships. Together, they confront these challenging aspects while trying to help Alice reclaim her inner child and rediscover the imaginative wonder that her grown-up self seems to have lost.|0
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be entertaining. They often rely on clichéd jokes, stereotypical characters, and predictable storylines which can make them feel monotonous after a while. The constant laugh tracks add to the artificiality and try to force a sense of amusement, even if the dialogue or situation isn't that funny. Occasionally there is a genuinely hilarious scene, but those are usually far and few between. Sitcoms seem to lose their initial charm and can grow tiring when trying to provide endless humor without depth or substantial innovation in the story.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I vividly remember the suspenseful music and terrifying scenes keeping me on the edge of my seat. However, revisiting the film almost 30 years later, the fear-factor seems diminished – the outdated visual effects, hammy acting, and corny one-liners inject a heavy dose of nostalgia but little else. Despite its dated appearance, it still brings back powerful memories from my childhood and served as my gateway into the world of horror movies that has now turned into a lifelong love affair with the genre.|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses , it starts losing its momentum. The storyline shifts its focus towards weaker subplots that dilute the chemistry between the characters. Although there are a few heartwarming scenes, the storyline eventually loses the charm of the promising start. Furthermore, the other members of the cast struggle to match up to the energetic duo, which further impedes the pace of the movie. As it comes to a close, it sadly fails to regain the earlier spark, ultimately resulting in a rather underwhelming cinematic experience.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started with this movie, which undoubtedly paved the way for classics like Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Just Before Dawn showcases a group of young campers venturing into the wild, only to fall victim to a psychotic family of murderous hillbillies. This thrilling masterpiece perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of terror and dread, that marked this period in horror cinema. The film masterfully balances gore and suspense while also delivering genuine scares and unforgettable performances.|0
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a mixed impression. On one hand, the visuals and special effects were undeniably impressive, showcasing the cityscape and dynamic action sequences in stunning detail. The storyline was intriguing enough to keep my attention throughout the entire movie, and the performances from the actors were quite commendable. However, on the other hand, I couldn't shake off the feeling that the movie had some inherent pacing and tonal issues. Some of the jokes fell flat, while certain key scenes could've benefitted from tighter editing.|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . As a fifteen-year-old back in 1959, watching this movie at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney left an everlasting impact on me. The atmosphere in the cinema was electric and infectious, drawing you deep into the emotions displayed on the big screen. Being new to the world of film at that time, the magic of storytelling, powerful visuals, and stunning performances by the actors left a profound mark on my psyche.|0
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more in-depth and allowed me to really appreciate the artistry, creativity, and hard work that went into the production. This behind-the-scenes glimpse not only showed the process of putting the show together, but also the incredible teamwork and camaraderie of the cast and crew. Watching how they overcame challenges, navigated difficult moments, and strived for perfection truly humanized the entire experience for me. In the end, my understanding and enjoyment of the show grew tenfold thanks to this fascinating insider perspective.|0
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own , right? Over the years, my preference in movies has led me down some obscure paths, unearthing hidden gems while being underwhelmed by so-called blockbusters. I admit that some might see my choices as polarizing or downright confounding, yet my appreciation for cinematic art knows no boundaries. From indie flicks to foreign masterpieces, experimental features, and classic sagas, my aim remains unwavering—to highlight films that deeply resonate with me, transcending cultural or artistic labels.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the film and depicted various emotions with sensitivity, but somewhere, the execution seemed to lack the potential the storyline had initially promised. The characters were relatable, and the actors have given noteworthy performances. However, certain elements appeared a bit disjointed, which impacted the pacing of the film, making some parts a tad slow. Nevertheless, it's appreciable that Aparna Sen tackled complex issues and unconventional relationships with grace, presenting a meaningful message that we can all take away from.|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) After showcasing their talent with Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, director Aparna Sen delivers yet another beautiful cinematic experience in this English language film. It effortlessly tackles intricate themes and captures the nuances of diverse emotions. The screenplay flows seamlessly, with Sen deftly navigating through an array of characters that effortlessly connect with the viewers. Cinematographer Dinesh Shidhaye skillfully employs unconventional angles to create a visually immersive experience, while editor and music director contribute immensely to making the film resonate with audiences across boundaries.|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit, but they were certainly impressive). The visuals were breathtaking, capturing each scene with such stunning detail that it was almost as if I were there in person. The audio complemented the imagery perfectly, providing an immersive and realistic auditory experience. The storyline and characters, though not groundbreaking, were engaging enough to hold my attention. While this production might not become a classic, it definitely has set the bar for outstanding quality and will leave a lasting impression on viewers.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron ( of En Vogue fame) being the host for a time. The program showcased the talents of both local and national musicians, representing a wide variety of genres such as jazz, blues, rock, and gospel. It was inspiring to witness so many brilliant performers, and even provided a platform for young, emerging artists. I fondly recall eagerly waiting for the weekly episodes, each time anticipating a unique and enthralling auditory experience.|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world of New York City.

A true reflection of female empowerment, this poignant, heartfelt drama still resonates today, revealing that behind the glitz and glamour of the publishing world, deep-rooted challenges remain.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the camera on his parents' long-term marriage, director Doug Block dives into the intimate details and secrets of a seemingly ordinary couple's life. Unearthing personal letters and journals, Block manages to delicately unpack and portray the complexity and vulnerability that accompany marriage and family dynamics. 51 Birch Street transcends conventional storytelling to pose intriguing questions about relationships, loyalty, and communication. It beautifully captures the intricacies of the human condition through the lens of a single family, shedding light on what truly binds people together for better or for worse.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit that Blazing Saddles still holds the top spot for me). As with most Brooks films, History of the World: Part I delivers that familiar mix of slapstick comedy, pun-filled dialogue, and no shortage of farcical antics. While it may not appeal to everyone's taste in humor, those who appreciate classic Mel Brooks shenanigans will not be disappointed. With an ensemble cast, featuring stars like Madeline Kahn and Gregory Hines, there's bound to be something for everyone who is up for a solid, zany good time.|0
"Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he earned the nickname ""the thinking woman's heartthrob"". But in reality, his seemingly mild persona conceals a man with substantial depth, nuance, and a wide emotional range. Throughout his extensive acting career, Alda has captivated audiences with not just his verbal prowess, but also his impeccable delivery and seamless transformations into every character he portrayed. As an actor and humanitarian, Alan Alda exudes a striking charisma that transcends the label of ""soft""."|0
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but for me, it was just what I needed at the time. The storyline was engaging, the acting was spot-on, and the music perfectly complimented the scenes. I understand that it may not cater to everyone's taste, but isn't that the beauty of films? It provided an escape and evoked a whirlwind of emotions for me. Maybe it's the nostalgic charm of certain scenes or perhaps just the cinematic experience, but this movie resonates with me deeply.|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's : rugged landscapes, galloping horses, gunfights, and cowboys trying to assert dominance. In the plot, the courageous and righteous protagonist confronts the town's antagonist – a cruel, cold-blooded outlaw – ultimately fighting for justice and his love interest, the local sweetheart. Thematic twists of revenge, brotherhood, and love keep the audience captivated while the picture-perfect portrayal of a harsh desert frontier embeds the narrative in realism. Period-appropriate costume designs and character developments elevate the film and carve its distinct position in 1950's cinematic history.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a lot of people know about it or even talk about it in conversations of classic 80s movies. A film that perfectly blends elements of drama, romance, and that nostalgic vintage charm, it truly stands the test of time in delivering an engaging narrative with richly layered characters that capture the hearts of the viewers. One can only imagine the cultural impact this film would have had if it received the spotlight it truly deserved.|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment .

This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children and is definitely family-friendly. The vibrant characters and whimsical plotline may come across as juvenile to some, but they truly capture the essence of innocence and escapism. As the storyline unfolds, it incorporates underlying themes such as friendship, bravery, and self-discovery. These poignant messages provide an additional layer for the viewers to explore and resonate with, making it appealing to a wider audience. Despite the unusual and childish concept, this film ultimately enchants with its quirky charm and warmth, serving as a lighthearted reminder of simpler times.|0
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am amazed at how well it has aged over the years! The brilliant storytelling, powerful performances, and mesmerizing cinematography have withstood the test of time. Not only does it deliver pure entertainment, but it also offers subtle life lessons and messages that resonate deeply with the audience. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I find myself more absorbed in the story and invested in the characters, uncovering new nuances and hidden gems I might have missed on previous viewings.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the entire Swedish film industry as well. This delightful comedy masterpiece delivers non-stop laughter and an engaging storyline that leaves audiences entertained from start to finish. With its brilliantly written script and impressive cast performances, 'Skenbart' manages to strike the perfect balance between wit and slapstick humor, creating memorable moments throughout the film. Showcasing the best of Scandinavian cinema, it truly stands the test of time and serves as an essential addition to any movie lover's collection.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this documentary, I realized there was so much more to learn. The detailed accounts of the uprising, the inmates' motivations, and the authorities' mishandling of the situation provide a powerful narrative. The director captures raw emotions and delves deep into the complexities surrounding the incident, showing it as a symbol of the struggle for human rights and dignity. In addition, the film brings to light previously undisclosed facts, forcing the viewer to confront issues of justice, race, and civil liberties.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making the film as a tribute to both his parents. As the narrative unfolds, the documentary turns into a deeply personal exploration of love, grief, and healing. Combining intimate interviews, candid conversations, and cherished home movies, the filmmaker delves into his family's history, seeking a better understanding of his mother and a renewed connection with his grieving father.

If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I simply cannot get enough of its brilliant storytelling, compelling characters, and the stunning visual effects. Each time I watch it, I discover a new aspect that adds even more depth and dimension to the storyline. The acting is superb, and I'm continually impressed by the attention to detail in the set design and costuming. This film manages to pull me into its immersive world and truly makes me care about the fate of its characters, evoking a range of emotions that keep me coming back for more.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule and the reviews had been mixed. Surprisingly, I found myself thoroughly entertained and invested in the characters' stories. The plot may have had a few predictable moments, but the unexpected twists and compelling performances more than made up for it. The film also showcased stunning visuals, leaving me in awe at certain scenes. Despite the movie's length, the pacing was steady and never lost my interest. Ultimately, the movie exceeded my initial expectations and made for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. There's something magical about watching films in an empty auditorium, each frame lighting up the entire space. Although being a projectionist can become monotonous at times, it's undeniably rewarding. The unique perspective of witnessing each production unfold, coupled with the mechanics and intricacies of running a projector, truly lends an insider's perspective into the world of cinema. On some occasions, fellow staff members even join me for a personal screening, enhancing my understanding of diverse movie preferences and cultivating shared memories we can cherish together.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art and Nature, Colonization and Civilization, or as an allegory on political power struggles. Other interpretations have examined it as an exploration of human identity, metaphysical self-discovery, and the complex dynamic between the rational and the instinctual self. Additionally, some consider The Tempest to be an example of the nascent genre of tragicomedy, with its skillful weaving of comedic elements within an essentially dramatic framework. Moreover, contemporary performances of the play often emphasize eco-criticism and the play's potential insights into post-colonial issues.|0
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a lifetime but can potentially influence their entire way of life. In many cases, these films can become more than just a mere source of entertainment. They transform into cultural staples and timeless pieces of art that mold future generations with their thought-provoking content, innovative storytelling techniques, and groundbreaking performances. In this regard, the power of cinema is remarkable, leaving indelible impressions on young minds, which later evolve into core values and ideologies that define their personalities, aspirations, and contribution to society.|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago . I still remember the excitement in the air, the sense of magic in that little theater. People lined up outside, buzzing about the storyline and actors. My friends and I could hardly contain ourselves as we took our seats, clutching the coveted tickets in our hands. The moment the lights dimmed and the projector started, the audience was instantly transported into another world. The performances, the cinematography, and the riveting storyline still remain engraved in my memories, serving as a constant reminder of that thrilling time.|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make inappropriate advances, Marjorie became an expert in handling any challenging work environment with a steely demeanor. It wasn't just about the typewriter or being fast at shorthand, it was more about learning to command respect and create a presence of quiet authority in male-dominated spaces. Marjorie's career had evolved greatly as gender dynamics began shifting in the workplace, her wisdom earned over the years proving invaluable for both her career success and personal growth.|0

The gameplay is incredibly smooth, with precise controls and physics that truly capture the thrill and excitement of professional skateboarding. It includes a variety of modes such as Career, Free Skate, and multiplayer, making it perfect for endless hours of enjoyment. One of the best aspects of the game is its level design. Each map offers challenging tasks, hidden secret areas, and exceptional tricks to keep the game fresh and engaging.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were the highlights of my summer as a young teen, evoking a sense of adventure and discovery. Both films showcased exotic locations that ignited my wanderlust, despite the low-budget productions. In the movie, the protagonists faced seemingly insurmountable challenges and braved through desolate deserts, as they pursued legendary artifacts hidden within ancient Egyptian tombs. The vivid storytelling coupled with my impressionable age led me to develop a lasting fascination with archaeology, mysteries of the past, and cinematic narratives that unfold in enthralling settings.|0
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Sun Shines Bright - each stands as a distinct testament to Ford's skill as a storyteller and his love for complex characters that challenge and expand the understanding of the American mythos. While Wagonmaster pays homage to pioneering spirits venturing into unknown lands, Sergeant Rutledge presents a deeply nuanced portrait of racial prejudices as the backdrop of an engaging courtroom drama. The Sun Shines Bright, on the other hand, tenderly deals with social redemption set in postbellum Southern society.|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film , blending elements of thrilling action, gripping storytelling, and compelling characters. The CGI and visual effects are stunning, immersing the viewer in the movie's futuristic universe. Moreover, the plot unravels at a gripping pace, holding one's attention throughout. The cast also delivers strong performances that evoke genuine emotions, with thought-provoking dialogue providing an intriguing exploration of the human experience. The production value, combined with meticulous attention to detail, places this film among the classics of the sci-fi genre, offering viewers an unforgettable experience.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like The Grapes of Wrath or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, which leave the audience pondering on powerful societal issues. Nevertheless, The Wagonmaster should not be overlooked, as it remains an engaging and visually impressive portrayal of the Old West, capturing the spirit of perseverance and camaraderie among settlers. With picturesque landscape shots and iconic horse chases, it delivers an appealing tale of personal triumph in the face of adversity, allowing the viewer to sit back and enjoy the adventurous spirit of classic Hollywood westerns.|0
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , sexually aggressive, and prone to crude behavior while women are submissive and often objectified. It seems as if a significant focus of their existence revolves around adhering to societal norms, be it by putting up with men's disrespectful antics or restraining their desires for career ambitions. This film provides a revealing glimpse into a time where casual sexism and toxic masculinity seemed to prevail, while also serving as a sharp reminder of how much our society has transformed.|0
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already watched it multiple times. The plot twists keep me hooked, and the character development is truly outstanding. Every episode manages to surprise me in a different way and constantly leaves me wanting more. The writers, actors, and production team are incredibly talented and perfectly bring the story to life. Plus, the amazing balance of humor, emotion, and suspense is addictive! This show is definitely one of the best I've ever seen, and I will proudly recommend it to everyone I know.|0
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . In today's fast-paced world, there seems to be an increasing desire to be more conscious, present and knowledgeable about the ongoing issues. Hence, to symbolize this new wave of enlightenment and wisdom, we commonly use the color ``Blue''. To be ``Blue'' signifies that one is deeply perceptive of both internal and external circumstances, acutely conscious about life and its complexities, and possess an open mindset that helps them sift through all that is odd, contradictory or complicated.|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound impact on me at that age. The compelling story, powerful performances, and skillful cinematography really drew me in and held my attention throughout. Watching it made me truly appreciate the art of storytelling and the ways that films can transport viewers into different worlds and situations. As I reflect on this experience now, I realize that this film sparked a lifelong passion for cinema, and perhaps even played a role in influencing my current career path.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me start by describing its eerie and thought-provoking plot. The movie begins with a suburban couple, Arthur and Norma, receiving a mysterious box with a large red button. Alongside the box comes an enigmatic man, presenting them with an unsettling proposition - they must choose whether to push the button or not. The consequences? Someone they don't know will die, but in return, they'll receive a life-altering sum of $1 million.|0

The train sets off on its perilous journey across enemy territory, teeming with Confederate ambushes and unexpected obstacles. As tension builds among the passengers, whispers of betrayal and conspiracy grow louder, prompting the ever-vigilant Clayton to remain constantly on alert. Amidst their mission, the Union soldiers must band together to guard the gold, unmask the mole on board, and dodge impending Confederate attacks.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight and Burt Reynolds were brilliant in their respective roles. The on-screen chemistry between the lead actors kept me thoroughly engrossed throughout the film. The stunning cinematography captured the raw beauty and intensity of the story, while the suspenseful score kept my heart racing at each turn. The director deserves praise for bringing together such a talented ensemble cast and eliciting remarkable performances from each of them. All in all, I'm grateful for this incredible experience and highly recommend it to everyone who loves classic cinema.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. It stretches the limits of convention with its bizarre imagery, ethereal soundtrack, and peculiar narrative. Directed with purposeful ambiguity, it presents a non-linear storyline, which further fuels a deep curiosity that cannot be easily shaken off. Although it might be too obtuse for some, it is an essential watch for those with a proclivity for experimental cinema.|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to see, and, to my surprise, it turned out to be an absolute hidden gem. A brilliantly made feature, overflowing with impressive performances and a thought-provoking, beautifully intricate plot that I simply couldn't get enough of. As the tape played on, I was engulfed into a captivating cinematic journey which thoroughly debunked the adage 'never judge a book by its cover,' in this case, a random VHS I happened to stumble upon.|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits over hunting season. In this hilarious and iconic Merrie Melodies animation, released in 1952, Bugs Bunny cleverly tricks his arch-rival, Daffy Duck, into arguing with dim-witted hunter Elmer Fudd about which season it truly is—duck or rabbit. Employing a series of brilliantly comedic tactics and wild misdirections, Bugs never fails to amaze viewers with his trademark sass and cunning schemes. This memorable escapade encapsulates the classic charm of these unforgettable characters, while showcasing the intelligent humor of early animation.|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a huge fan of classic comedy films. This movie, directed by Mel Brooks, is a hilarious parody of the traditional Robin Hood story. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood flawlessly, and the humor is endless. The film skillfully blends elements of slapstick, wordplay, and situational comedy. It is lighthearted and the witty dialogue makes it even more enjoyable. For fans of comedy and classic legends, this film is a must-watch. Give yourself a break from serious movies, and dive into this rib-tickling comedic gem!|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 times since then, and it just gets better with every watch. The plot is gripping and the acting is top-notch. The storyline, characters, and dialogues feel so natural and compelling that you simply cannot take your eyes off the screen. I particularly love the score, which sets the mood perfectly and elevates the overall cinematic experience. In fact, every technical aspect, from cinematography to sound design, is brilliant.|0
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in the series, mainly because it boasts excellent gameplay mechanics, engaging storylines, and an incredibly immersive world that the player can get lost in for hours on end. Despite the less-than-stellar graphics, players will quickly be drawn to the well-developed characters, innovative level designs, and smooth controls that make it a satisfying experience for all. In addition, the game features an impressive and diverse soundtrack, contributing to a thrilling atmosphere.|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying these low-budget horror flicks, but something about them always intrigues me. So, I popped it into the DVD player on a gloomy evening, fully prepared for the usual clichés and amateur acting. Surprisingly, Just Before Dawn ended up being an enjoyable watch. It definitely had its fair share of cringe-worthy moments, but overall the plot was gripping, and the actors gave more convincing performances than expected. Plus, the setting added a sense of unease which kept me on the edge of my seat.|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally streamlined the narrative to create a more focused and intense theatrical experience. He has shifted emphasis on certain relationships, deepened emotional complexities, and accentuated the core themes of moral decadence, beauty, and corruption present in Wilde's original work. This adaptation hones in on the intense psychological conflict within the protagonist while keeping the satirical and ironic tone of Wilde's original. Furthermore, by seamlessly integrating the haunting presence of the supernatural, Osborne heightens the dramatic tension and lays bare the ever-present societal hypocrisies that drove Wilde's pen.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her soft, sensitive skin. The tension in the room escalated as Alan masterfully controlled the thin, sharp blade with an exquisite delicacy, knowing that one wrong move could turn the scene into a gore fest. As beads of sweat trickled down his forehead, the rest of the group collectively held their breath, eagerly awaiting the big reveal. Once he was done, Alan slowly pulled out the stencil he'd stealthily placed, exposing the exquisite and intricate design skillfully shaved into the otherwise untouched fabric.|0
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it immediately. Upon watching it, I discovered a fascinating portrayal of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh's life and reign. The film delves into Akhenaton's religious revolution, wherein he attempted to replace polytheism with monotheism, by exclusively worshiping the sun god Aten. The storyline also explores his relationships with Queen Nefertiti and their daughters, as well as the various conflicts and controversies of his rule. The visuals are stunning, accurately capturing ancient Egyptian culture and the complexities of this tumultuous period.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i 've noticed some concerns regarding the show's approach towards contestants. The show emphasizes heavily on looks, and at times can promote an unhealthy body image among participants and viewers alike. The pressure to fit into a specific mold can take a toll on a contestant's mental and emotional health. Moreover, with the increasing emphasis on body positivity and inclusivity, the show should strive to break beauty stereotypes and encourage contestants from all backgrounds and body types.|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile relationships with them, and how we take them for granted sometimes. The storyline delves deep into the complexities of parenthood and highlights the emotional struggles that they face in raising their children, who grow up and start leading their own lives. The characters are brilliantly portrayed, and the raw emotions they exhibit are extremely relatable. With an unexpected plot twist that leaves you on the edge of your seat, this film beautifully portrays the bittersweet bonds between parents and children.|0
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Lost City', and was shrouded in mystery and legends. No map, no clear directions; just countless stories and brave souls seeking it. Delving deep into the dense forests, facing unknown perils, but driven by sheer determination and hope, the journey has been truly an epic adventure. Countless hours of decoding riddles, picking up hidden clues, and perseverance, paid off as I stood at the doorstep of 'The Lost City'. The sight before me – astonishing and beyond imagination.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle delves deeper into the life of our beloved, quirky couple on their rustic farm. As Ma and Pa continue their colorful journey of family misadventures, new characters and challenging situations arise, providing much-needed excitement and chaos in their seemingly mundane rural existence. New dilemmas in their fields lead Ma and Pa to comically battle not just their capricious animals, but also the baffling farm equipment and bureaucracy, bringing about unforgettable experiences that solidify the unique charm of their dynamic relationship.|0
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary , and a renowned playwright find themselves lost in the idyllic English countryside. With each bickering over the proper direction, tensions between the three simmer. As the daylight dwindles and tempers fray, an eerie encounter at an unexpected stop leads them to a welcoming yet quirky inn run by a peculiar host. Inside the rustic abode, they discover other artists seeking inspiration who, much like them, stumbled upon this cozy safe-haven away from the stressors of their chosen crafts.|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 or 10 years old at the time, and I instantly fell in love with this movie. The visual effects were amazing, especially considering the era it was produced in. The vibrant colors, detailed costumes, and intriguing set designs really captured my attention and sparked my imagination. As a child, the unique story captured my sense of adventure, making me wish that I too could embark on exciting journeys with the film's characters.|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the onslaught of the ruthless enemy troops. Under the fierce leadership of General Spanky, brave soldiers rally together and strategically engage the opposition, driven by their undying commitment to safeguard their homeland and loved ones. Throughout the bitter conflict, General Spanky proves himself as an innovative military strategist, displaying unwavering fortitude, relentless pursuit of victory, and an inspiring ability to unify those under his command. Resolutely, his courageous men form a formidable resistance and bravely confront their adversaries.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool action sequences and memorable characters that really had us entertained from beginning to end. The film's plot had us gripped with its blend of comedy, adventure, and unexpected twists, keeping us on the edge of our seats. The soundtrack perfectly accompanied the story, making the entire experience a great audio-visual delight. What made the night truly memorable, though, was sharing it with my girlfriend – her laughter and enjoyment of the movie just made it that much more enjoyable.|0
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone on set could sense the magic happening. Slim effortlessly portrayed the complex character in a way that resonated with both the cast and the audience. His dedication to the role brought a level of depth and realism that truly brought the story to life. Throughout the film's production, it was evident that Slim's passion for his craft was infectious. It inspired not only his fellow actors but also the crew members to elevate their game.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , kangaroo wranglers, and an outback setting steeped in Aboriginal folklore. These classic tropes created an exciting but rather one-dimensional view of the Australian culture and landscape. Fast forward to the present day and you will find that Australian cinema has matured significantly. The once predictable plots and character archetypes have given way to a wave of dynamic storytelling, delving deep into diverse social issues, personal struggles, and multiculturalism. Consequently, the Australian film industry now presents a rich and authentic exploration of contemporary life 'Down Under', attracting audiences worldwide.|0
"`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ? Because that's the role you've just been cast in,"" the cold voice replied menacingly. Trembling with fear, the actor desperately tried to recall his most convincing performance to-date. As he took a deep breath, he thought, maybe – just maybe – he could survive this ordeal. Silence filled the air before he fell to the ground with remarkable grace, his breaths shallow, heart pounding inside his motionless body."|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to showcase their talent and chemistry together. The emotional depth and complexity portrayed by these actresses makes the characters relatable, engaging the audience from start to finish. The witty banter and comical situations injected throughout the movie brings levity to the poignant story, offering the perfect blend of humor and heart. The strong supporting cast elevates the performances, making the movie a well-rounded ensemble piece. The phenomenal storytelling paired with Jackie and Candice's exceptional acting skills create a memorable, must-watch film.|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. The vivid portrayal of the characters not only transports you back to the naive world of innocence, but it also instills a strong sense of nostalgia. Masterful direction and poignant performances create an undeniable connection with the viewer, leaving one reminiscing on both the exhilaration and fragility of youth. Throughout this emotional journey, the movie skillfully highlights the value of genuine friendships and the internal growth stemming from personal experiences. A timeless work, it reignites the yearning to seize life and relive our lost moments of exuberance and abandon.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I absolutely adored it! It was such a classic coming-of-age tale that expertly captured the magic and joy of youthful imagination. Disney Channel made a point to regularly air this enchanting feature, and for good reason. It had heartwarming friendships, suspenseful challenges, and that signature Disney magic. In addition, the young actors and actresses delivered powerful, yet relatable, performances that easily won over my childhood heart. All in all, I believe the movie evoked powerful feelings of nostalgia and remained an all-time favorite among young Disney Channel enthusiasts.|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But Bugs Bunny is not going to be an easy target. Determined to outwit Daffy, he switches the signs to read ""duck season"" and hides in his rabbit hole, leaving his feathery friend completely unaware. When Elmer Fudd shows up, gun in hand, he sees the signs and begins to target Daffy instead. A panicked Daffy must now work with his would-be nemesis, Bugs Bunny, to convince the overzealous Elmer Fudd that they have both made a mistake."|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what I've read, watched, and heard about them through various interviews and documentaries. It is said that the Carpenters were incredibly talented musicians and a force to be reckoned with in the music industry during the 1970s. Karen, with her hauntingly beautiful voice, and Richard with his prowess in songwriting and arrangement, created timeless melodies that resonated with fans across the globe. Their story is as heart-wrenching as it is inspiring. They navigated fame together, experiencing both highs and lows as siblings and performers.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most people in the audience were excited to see it as well. From the moment the film started, it captured my attention and took me on an unforgettable journey. The visuals were stunning and the performances by the actors were exceptional. The storyline had the perfect blend of action, drama, and suspense which kept me at the edge of my seat. This movie far exceeded my expectations and is a must-see for all.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure of what to do, as his hunting instincts seem to conflict with the camaraderie he has formed with both Bugs and Daffy throughout their escapades. But he knows he must choose. As the sun sets on this particular day of toil and laughter, the consequences of Elmer's decision could echo in eternity, tearing at the very fabric of their legendary friendship. Amidst the bustling backdrop of nature's orchestra, Elmer braces himself and takes aim.|0
"It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" situation with no in-between. I decided to watch the movie and form my own opinion, and honestly, I can understand both sides of the argument. The storyline had a unique concept, which was great and refreshing, but at the same time, the plot was slightly chaotic and at times, it felt disconnected. The cinematography was outstanding and I really enjoyed the soundtrack as well."|0
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) , I couldn't be more thrilled to revisit these classic cartoons from my childhood! This set contains six DVD discs with more than 50 of the best Loony Tunes episodes featuring all-time favorite characters, like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and Road Runner. Not only are the visuals remastered, but it also has bonus material, including commentary by animation experts and rare behind-the-scenes footage, which give fascinating insights into the creation of these beloved shorts.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a general concept aimed at fostering peace and harmony within a nation or community. From what I gather, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission usually comes into play after a period of conflict, where atrocities have been committed and trust has broken down between different parties. It seems that the ultimate goal is to create an environment in which past grievances are aired and acknowledged in order to move forward with a more constructive and compassionate approach.|0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , this episode still delivered its signature mix of satire, social commentary, and humor. The storyline had a surprisingly engaging balance, making even the simplest of scenes entertaining to watch. The episode tackled some serious contemporary issues, injecting just the right amount of absurdity and comedy without sacrificing depth. The colorful characters continued to engage the audience while driving the plot forward. The amusing narrative was not without unexpected twists, managing to keep fans engaged throughout the episode.|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks ' masterpiece ""Only Angels Have Wings."" The film follows Barthelmess as he plays the role of a brave yet weary pilot navigating the precarious skies to complete his missions. Just like the Hawks' film, ""Precoder"" wonderfully captures the true essence of adventure, determination, and camaraderie. Barthelmess' performance is undoubtedly impressive, managing to showcase the struggle his character goes through, and allowing viewers to immerse themselves into his turbulent journey."|0
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Sahara Desert, delves deep into the intricacies of human existence and our relationship with nature. Straying from traditional narrative norms, this avant-garde cinematic masterpiece beautifully captures the hypnotic allure of desert mirages and the captivating spirit of its people. Herzog's contemplative gaze weaves poetic montages and landscapes, while blending observational footage with atmospheric scores, stirring poignant emotions in its audience. Evoking an array of interpretations, Fata Morgana unapologetically engages its viewers in a sensorial odyssey of philosophical introspection and redefining storytelling techniques.|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the stories in books and movies often portray. Amidst the whirlwind of high school life and awkward adolescent feelings, those early romantic encounters served as a lesson in the world of love. Nervous giggles and stolen glances become a marker of this young love that starts growing between two inexperienced hearts. Tentative flirtations and awkward silences set the scene as both navigate their burgeoning feelings, unsure of what lies ahead. Palms sweating, faces blushing, stammered conversations; teenage love brings its own brand of bittersweet innocence.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 2021. The show definitely lived up to the hype, as the character development, storylines, and visuals were simply amazing. It is rare for a mini-series to have such an impact, keeping the audience fully immersed in every single moment. As an emotionally invested viewer, I could relate to the struggles of each character. Even though the show was from an earlier era, its themes are relevant even today. I was pleasantly surprised and I cannot recommend this hidden gem highly enough.|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange program for a few months and movie nights have become a weekly ritual for us. Our cozy gatherings help us unwind and bond after exploring the city during the day. We had picked a classic French movie, hoping to improve our language skills and immerse ourselves in the local culture. Settling in with popcorn, blankets, and a charcuterie board, we enjoyed the film and noticed similarities in themes and character types with our own cinema experiences.|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not have high expectations. The trailers looked average and it seemed like it might be just another cliché film. However, I was blown away by the captivating plot and superb acting. The director and actors managed to tell a truly immersive and emotionally driven story that transcended the limitations of its genre. It wasn't only visually stunning, but it was also deeply engaging, as it challenged societal norms and allowed the viewer to become lost in this extraordinary world.|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much , although I recognize that it is a matter of personal choice and preference. To be fair, the quality and execution of the content in this instance were commendable and the performers were professional. Moreover, the approach seemed more focused on consent, mutual pleasure, and responsible intimacy rather than a shallow or exploitative narrative. Nevertheless, as someone who is not particularly fond of adult entertainment, my bias might limit my ability to fully appreciate and rate it with a perfect ten stars.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
"Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most innovative and influential periods in animation history. Known for his daring humor, eye-popping visuals, and sharp wit, Avery pushed the boundaries of the medium, leading to the creation of some of the most iconic characters, such as Droopy Dog and the wolf from ""Red Hot Riding Hood."" His unique storytelling and distinctive animation style transformed the entire industry and paved the way for future animators like Chuck Jones and Walt Disney."|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted abroad, gaining international recognition and popularity. This cultural phenomenon, directed by Cédric Klapisch, explores the vibrant and chaotic life of a group of diverse European students living together in an apartment in Barcelona, Spain. Through humorous anecdotes and genuine interactions, ""L'auberge Espagnole"" beautifully showcases the multicultural mosaic of Europe and embodies the spirit of the Erasmus exchange program. As a witty, feel-good comedy that transcends language barriers, the film truly resonated with viewers and ultimately cemented its position as an iconic piece of contemporary French cinema."|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I must say this assumption is quite unfair and rooted in stereotypes. While it may be true that some individuals may lack global awareness, we should not generalize an entire population. In reality, there are numerous well-informed Americans who have an extensive understanding of different cultures, geopolitics, and global issues. The presence of world-renowned universities and organizations, multicultural cities, and access to the internet make it possible for citizens to broaden their understanding of international matters.|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film that has managed to capture the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide. The impeccable direction, combined with a compelling and multi-layered narrative, effortlessly draws us into the story, making us feel as though we're right alongside the characters as they embark on their journey. Furthermore, the stunning visuals and remarkable performances have elevated this film into an instant classic. Its ability to blend powerful emotions and thought-provoking themes resonates deeply, leaving an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to experience it.|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` The Cell'' seems like a straightforward psychological thriller. However, this unique cinematic experience goes beyond genres and immerses the audience into a dark, visually captivating world. Directed by Tarsem Singh, the film stars Jennifer Lopez as a child psychologist tasked with delving into the twisted psyche of a comatose serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, to save his latest victim. It blends elements of science fiction, horror, and drama in an engrossing storyline that explores the human mind's depths.|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in delving deep into the intricacies of her personal struggles and relationships, it still provides a fascinating glimpse into her remarkable career and untimely death. Touching upon her battle with anorexia, the impact of her parents' expectations, and her strained bond with her brother Richard, the film sheds light on Karen's vulnerability behind her remarkable talent. Despite certain narrative shortcomings, The Karen Carpenter Story succeeds in celebrating the enduring legacy and angelic voice of one of the most influential singers of her time.|0
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as intimidating as men in movies, the landscape of the film industry started to change dramatically. Gone were the days where females played a secondary or subordinate role, and women were suddenly cast as main characters in powerful and groundbreaking movies that celebrated the many dimensions of being a woman. Feminist and action flicks portrayed them as cunning warriors, unafraid leaders, resilient survivors, and fearless crusaders, all while dismantling long-standing patriarchal standards of gender representation in cinema.|0
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of the kills were quite creative and brutal, satisfying even the most seasoned horror fans. The acting was surprisingly solid, making me care about the characters' fates, while the suspense had me on the edge of my seat. The storyline had some originality and refreshing twists, preventing the usual predictability. Although some cliche elements were present, they didn't feel overdone or tiresome. All in all, this slasher/gore film exceeded expectations, proving to be an enjoyable, adrenaline-pumping experience that breathes new life into the genre.|0
"Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , DVDs, and even rare collectibles from the series. Watching Dad's Army has always been my favorite pastime, allowing me to escape to a different era, filled with hilarity and camaraderie. Whenever I hear the famous catchphrases like, ""Don't panic!"" or ""Stupid boy! "", it just warms my heart and brings a huge smile to my face. I even find myself participating in fan forums and discussions about the show to connect with fellow enthusiasts."|0
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been wanting to watch it again for nostalgia's sake. Recently, I came across the film online, and it instantly took me back to those golden days of watching movies under the stars with friends and family. As I began streaming it, the sense of excitement from years ago came flooding back. The film's story, acting, and cinematography were just as good as I remembered, and despite the advances in modern filmmaking, it still holds up today.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1

The conflict between the two men starts spiraling out of control as jealousy fuels dirty tricks and perilous confrontations. As the stakes get higher, they both need to decide what lengths they will go to for the affection of their lady love.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
"`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life drama and dark humor that characterizes the best of Australian cinema. The film skillfully blends intense moments of crime, action, and suspense with heartfelt emotion and an endearing human touch. Set amidst the gritty underworld of Sydney, it showcases captivating performances from its talented cast, especially the late Heath Ledger and a pre-Hollywood fame, Rose Byrne. Driven by an engaging story, unforgettable characters, and distinct Aussie slang, ""Two Hands"" offers a refreshing break from Hollywood blockbusters, and solidifies its status as an Australian cinematic treasure."|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The firm specializes in providing top-notch protection to high-profile clients, including politicians and celebrities. One day, Brian receives an assignment to protect the daughter of a prominent businessman, Laura ( Julie Adams ), who has been receiving anonymous threatening messages. Initially, Laura dismisses the threats and is reluctant to cooperate with Brian. As their time together progresses, Laura begins to see the importance of her safety, and Brian discovers that there's more to the case than initially meets the eye.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I had anticipated. Rather, it showcased a cleverly crafted story that revolved around psychological tensions and a battle for survival in the midst of an eerie wilderness setting. As the suspense built up throughout the film, I appreciated how the director carefully revealed each character's intentions, and created palpable suspense by tapping into the primal fears of isolation and vulnerability. There was a smattering of gory moments, but the core focus was truly on developing an atmosphere of dread and engaging character dynamics.|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, it is refreshing to see such creative storytelling, exploring unique themes and human relationships in a poignant and captivating manner. But, on the other hand, it leaves me yearning for more. A well-crafted short film like Boy-Next-Door resonates deeply, leaving viewers to ruminate on the complexity of the characters and the universality of their experiences. Though it may be fleeting in length, its emotional impact is long-lasting, and ultimately leaves me craving additional storylines that build upon this exceptional groundwork.|0
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 2010. It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon, and we were enjoying a break from our hectic Disneyland adventures. As we stepped into the dim theater, the air conditioner gave us respite from the heat, and the aroma of fresh popcorn greeted us. The excitement in our eyes was tangible as we eagerly settled into our plush red seats. I remember vividly that as the movie began to roll, both our faces lit up with joy, bonding us over a cinematic experience we would never forget.|0
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I would often listen to my grandfather narrate it, sitting by the fireplace, his eyes twinkling with excitement as the story unfolded. The characters came to life before me as I immersed myself in their magical world, brimming with adventure, camaraderie, and valuable life lessons. Years later, now as a father myself, I cherish the opportunity to share this tale with my own children, passing on the enchantment, love, and wisdom embedded within it.|0
"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends & Neighbors, with his third feature, ""The Unexpected Journey"". This intimate drama showcases LaBute's ability to delve deep into the human psyche and explore the complexities of emotions, relationships, and morality. Weaving together an ensemble cast of vivid characters, the story follows an estranged family as they embark on a road trip that forces them to confront their past, work through their differences, and ultimately find solace in their bond."|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even an understatement! It brings a wave of nostalgia that can make anyone smile from ear to ear. The timeless story, the unforgettable characters, and the beautiful animation have stood the test of time, making it a cherished classic for generations to come. The inspiring themes of friendship, loyalty, and adventure evoke an unparalleled warmth and joy every time I watch it. The captivating songs still ring in my mind as I remember those wonderful moments shared with friends and family.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. The hilarious dialogue and incredible comedic timing of the actors kept the audience constantly engaged and roaring with laughter throughout. The slapstick comedy, mixed with a touch of dark humor, and even some clever pop-culture references cater to different tastes and ensures that there's something for everyone to enjoy. Add to that a well-executed plot with the perfect amount of twists and turns that keeps you hooked till the end, this film makes for an outstanding choice when looking for a night of quality entertainment.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model, I didn't think I'd become so addicted to it. But I find myself eagerly waiting for each episode, excited to see the transformations, stunning photoshoots, and fierce runway walks these contestants bring every week. It's amazing to watch the models evolve throughout the competition, growing both in their skills and confidence, even when drama arises in the model house. The judges, though brutally honest at times, genuinely want to mentor and prepare the models for the cut-throat world of the fashion industry.|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist , I wanted to clarify this misconception before delving into the contents of the film. This movie is, in fact, an exploration of the fascinating history and cultural impact of radio as a medium of communication, set against the backdrop of various urban cities. As you journey through the vivid narratives of radio personalities and historical events, this documentary seamlessly intertwines captivating stories with archival footage. Undoubtedly, this compelling account delves into a completely different world from the one you might have expected.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . The breathtaking footage captures the vivid, enchanting beauty of marine creatures and their mysterious underwater world like never before. Vibrant colors, intricate details, and graceful movement create an immersive experience, leaving viewers mesmerized. Narration complements the visuals, effectively blending education with wonder. Various underwater ecosystems, including vibrant coral reefs and deep, enigmatic trenches, were meticulously explored, resulting in an engaging exploration of both the astonishing biodiversity of aquatic life and the harsh challenges faced in a changing global climate.|0
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man who, against all odds, come together to find solace and inspiration in one another's lives. They traverse the complexities of societal expectations, personal obstacles, and emotional setbacks while bravely journeying towards the pursuit of their dreams. Set against the mundane yet nostalgic backdrop of suburban America, this film humanizes both characters, effortlessly blending vulnerability with resilience. The delicate interweaving of each subplot gracefully elevates the significance of simple human connection.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the best sitcoms ever created, both in terms of its humor and its relatability. Kevin James and Leah Remini have unbeatable on-screen chemistry that captivates the audience with every episode. Their portrayal of Doug and Carrie Heffernan perfectly embodies the trials, tribulations, and joys of a typical working-class American family, making viewers laugh out loud as well as genuinely care for the characters. Furthermore, the unique blend of quick-witted dialogue, clever storylines, and outstanding ensemble cast ensures that this show will continue to entertain for generations to come.|0
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , Tyra Banks, who brings charisma and expertise to the show. The series not only entertains millions of viewers but also showcases the exciting world of fashion, make-up, and photography. Contestants face fierce competition, and the show is packed with drama, tears, and victories, making it an engaging watch. Each season presents different themes, judges, and models, constantly evolving to remain relevant in the ever-changing landscape of modeling.|0
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast including some of Hollywood's biggest names, who deliver exceptional performances throughout. The cinematography and visuals are stunning, drawing you into a captivating narrative. Moreover, the excellent soundtrack sets the tone for an epic journey full of twists, turns, and memorable moments. While the lengthy runtime may seem daunting at first, the sheer scale and depth of the storyline makes every minute worth it. Don't be discouraged by the duration; sit back, relax, and immerse yourself in this cinematic masterpiece that unfolds over multiple evenings.|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release of the film piqued our interest and we just had to see it for ourselves. The theater was packed, and you could feel the anticipation in the air. As the movie began, the controversy faded away and was replaced by awe at the impressive performances and intricate storyline. There was no denying the sheer brilliance of the cinematography and gripping dialogues. Once the movie was over, people stayed behind to discuss and debate their opinions.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up its success to a captivating storyline and strong visuals that explore themes like existentialism, creation, and the meaning of life. This mesmerizing piece of cinematic art entices its audience with thought-provoking questions and mesmerizing landscapes, leaving a lasting impression on their minds. Fata Morgana, as a unique entry in the metaphysical genre, presents its viewers with intricate narrative layers while maintaining an air of mystery. This elevates the movie-watching experience, solidifying its position as an exception in the often overlooked, yet intriguing, world of metaphysical cinema.|0
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait for shows and movies to be available on streaming platforms or resort to using an old-fashioned antenna. Living in a rural area can be frustrating at times when it comes to access to certain types of entertainment, but it also has its own set of unique charms. Limited access encourages me to explore the world outside of television, indulge in reading or spend time connecting with nature. On the other hand, it fosters my anticipation for when my favorite shows do become available online, giving me something to look forward to.|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but last weekend, I decided to treat myself. I went to see the highly acclaimed movie that had just been released. I have to admit, there was something magical about being among the first people to witness it on the big screen. The crowd's energy, reactions, and emotions truly amplified the entire cinematic experience. In the end, despite the expensive ticket, I left the theater feeling thoroughly entertained and surprisingly grateful for the unique atmosphere.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a fascinating glimpse into their rich history and culture through your work. The untold stories of these resilient individuals, who were such integral parts of the American frontier and its expansion, offer important perspectives in our collective understanding of the past. Your effort in showcasing their skill, courage, and ingenuity has broadened the representation of cowboys and the Wild West. By shining a light on these historically overlooked trailblazers, you have given a voice to a proud legacy, paving the way for future generations to be inspired by their accomplishments.|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a sense of power and resilience that we often lack in traditional on-screen depictions of women. Her character was multidimensional and brilliantly acted. Not only was she fierce and confident, but she was also compassionate, empathetic, and driven by purpose. In the face of challenges, she stayed true to herself and continued fighting for what she believed in. Through the movie's ups and downs, she remained a source of strength and determination.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up the Down Staircase '' with its recount of a young, idealistic teacher's struggles to make a difference in an impoverished South Carolina island school in the late 1960s. Pat uses this backdrop to illustrate the appalling disparity in educational resources between rural black students and their white counterparts. As he engages with his students, community and oppressive school officials, the narrative unfurls with deep themes of prejudice, political struggles, and the essence of human relationships.|0
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema and challenging audiences with his thought-provoking stories and eccentric characters. Since the late 1960s, his diverse filmography has encompassed both documentaries and fiction, defying conventional genre norms and reflecting Herzog's singular vision. Beyond simply entertaining, Herzog's films often delve deep into human psyche, exploring themes of obsession, ambition, and isolation. Driven by the auteur's bold narrative and unique perspective, his works redefine cinema, reshaping perspectives on what it can and should be.|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy together, perhaps? Unfortunately, these celebrated directors are known for their boundary-pushing, avant-garde films that cater to more mature and artsy audiences rather than to kids with short attention spans. Think mysterious, intense storylines riddled with twists, mind-bending surrealism, and dialogue exploring profound existential themes. While these may offer a cinematic feast for enthusiasts of independent films, these auteurs’ darkly provoking masterpieces could leave younger audiences scratching their heads and craving a quick fix of laughter and adventure, as opposed to delving into enigmatic characters and adult complexities.|0
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Harry Carey Jr.) to guide them safely across the wild frontier to a promising plot of land in the San Juan Valley. As the journey commences, both men, accustomed to a life of isolation and tough encounters, learn about the core values of faith, love, and camaraderie as the convoy encounters challenges of the unpredictable, unforgiving land. Bandits, grueling conditions, and divided leadership lead Travis and Sandy to reconsider their initial understanding of what makes a person truly tough.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into the discussion of race, identity, and power in the American West. Set in the late 19th century, Posse offers a perspective that showcases the experience of African American cowboys and how they battled racial oppression during that time. Featuring a predominantly black cast, the movie empowers and celebrates people of color and their unique contributions to Western society. Besides highlighting the contributions of Black cowboys, it also draws attention to the resilience, courage, and strength of these individuals.|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface -level storytelling. With a catchy and memorable soundtrack, the television film manages to capture the viewers' attention and create an engaging experience. Visually, the scenes are well shot, and the costume and set designs are meticulously crafted, adding to the overall aesthetic appeal of the project. However, the film's weak point lies in its lack of depth and substance in terms of storytelling, leaving viewers unsatisfied and craving a richer narrative experience.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
"`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a psychopath, but also into the mysterious realm of human consciousness itself. Director Tarsem Singh meticulously constructs a dark and nightmarish atmosphere, brimming with lavish imagery, bizarre dream sequences, and brilliantly unsettling character design. By breaking the barriers between reality and the subconscious mind, ""The Cell"" artfully unravels the human psyche in the most mesmerizing way, forcing its viewers to confront and challenge their perception of fear, fantasy, and sanity."|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a huge fan of slapstick comedy before watching this masterpiece, but it has completely changed my perspective on this genre. The impeccable timing, brilliant performances from the star-studded cast, and outstanding one-liners left me in tears, grasping my sides due to laughter. Moreover, the sheer unpredictability and countless twists and turns in the storyline are not only commendable but addictive, leaving you wondering what's going to happen next. Trust me when I say you will never have a dull moment when watching this flick.|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . However, there's something intriguing about westerns that often reels me in, despite my preference for other genres. The appeal could lie in the rugged, individualistic nature of these characters that were bred in the unforgiving, yet charming, Wild West. It might also have to do with the striking cinematography showcasing beautiful landscapes that so vividly illustrate the background for the vivid gun-slinging action, as witnessed in films such as Unforgiven and Tombstone.|0
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a bit cliche and predictable, but the sincere emotions and beautiful cinematography make it worth watching. The protagonists portray the innocence and intensity of first love, learning to navigate the complexities of relationships and adulthood. Along with the subtle humor, this coming-of-age tale touches the heart and ignites a feeling of nostalgia for one's own youthful romance. Through engaging dialogues and dynamic interactions, this story takes us back to the simplicity of those bygone days when every emotion felt like a magical adventure.|0
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it . The quirky, offbeat nature of the movie definitely added an element of unpredictability which was quite refreshing, as it strayed from typical cliches found in many films today. The humor was witty and blended seamlessly into the surreal storyline, eliciting laughs throughout. The well-written characters further enhanced the experience with their captivating, oddball personalities. Overall, this unconventional film was thoroughly entertaining and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a bizarre, fun-filled cinematic adventure.|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata, India. However, the intriguing title aptly captures the essence of the film. Directed by Aparna Sen, ""15 Park Avenue"" navigates the complex intersections between reality and delusions experienced by Mithi, a young woman grappling with schizophrenia. Shot on a quaint Kolkata backdrop, the storyline draws its audience in through heartwarming bonds shared amongst family members who endure the strenuous experience of living with a loved one afflicted with mental illness."|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right , that's what he thinks. This twisted maniac goes by the name of 'Divine Intervention.' Every gruesome crime scene has a different scripture painted in blood, calling out each of his victims as sinners and quoting their alleged transgressions. Detective Lawrence Montgomery has taken up the grisly challenge of chasing this self-proclaimed 'angel of vengeance.' Racing against time, the detective uncovers sinister secrets about his own past as he delves deeper into the depraved and calculating mind of the 'Divine Intervention' murderer.|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died suddenly at the age of 58, leaving a huge void in my heart. The memories we shared, the laughter, and the moments spent together are all I have left to cling on to now. Michelle's vivacious personality, contagious laughter, and incredible heart had always managed to light up the room. Though it is immensely painful to have lost her so suddenly, I'm eternally grateful to have known such a remarkable person.|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of street crime and gritty realism with a surprising element of supernatural whimsy, drawing the audience into the absurdly twisted lives of its characters. Our protagonist, a small-time crook named Jimmy, suddenly finds himself at the center of an increasingly complicated series of schemes, all thanks to a seemingly innocuous visit to a fortune teller. With a chaotic blend of action, romance, and an ensemble of idiosyncratic misfits, this unpredictable tale delivers not only laughter and thrills, but also leaves viewers questioning the bizarre and unpredictable nature of life itself.|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into the mix, creates a captivating fusion of genres. The protagonist embarks on a perilous quest across the lawless and rugged frontier, seeking vengeance for unspeakable acts inflicted upon him and his community. This character-driven narrative brings newfound depth and intensity to the timeless struggle of racial injustice, touching the viewers deeply with profound humanity amidst the bloody, bullet-riddled backdrop. Stirring themes of unity, resilience, and retribution imbue the story with an enthralling complexity, while ultimately exploring the raw duality of good versus evil.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year, garnering a range of reactions from people who loved its powerful storytelling to others who couldn't stomach the graphic content. I had to see it for myself to form my own opinion. After finally watching the movie, I found myself captivated by the masterful storytelling, poignant character arcs, and cinematography, yet utterly challenged and shaken by the stark depictions of violence, societal issues, and themes presented throughout the film.|0
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this particular movie that captivated me despite my initial misgivings. The cinematography, acting, and character development surpassed my expectations and managed to keep me hooked till the very end. Perhaps it was the witty script, the innovative plot twist, or the subtle touches of humor interjected throughout; whatever it was, it struck a chord that resonated deeply. While I still find this genre predominantly underwhelming, I am unexpectedly eager to recommend this refreshing take that surely deserves accolades for its well-executed blend of uniqueness and charm.|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her teenage daughter, both navigating through life's ups and downs, challenges and successes.

This captivating, addictive series shines with impeccable acting, exploring family bonds, friendships and even romance with witty banter and impeccable comedic timing. Offering valuable life lessons with an excellent blend of dramatic tension and laugh-out-loud moments, it remains relevant and impactful for a new generation to rediscover its magic.|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated fully. This visually stunning, surreal sci-fi thriller is a psychological roller coaster that explores the depths of a serial killer's mind. With Jennifer Lopez's solid performance and Tarsem Singh's unique direction, this film breaks conventional narrative barriers, showcasing impressive, evocative visuals that simultaneously enchant and disturb viewers. Although The Cell received mixed reviews, one cannot deny its cult-classic status. For viewers with an open mind and a taste for the extraordinary, the movie's beautiful artistic execution will be hard to forget.|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. The movie's advertisement featuring an all-star cast in awkward, goofy poses screamed 'trashy, cliche-filled flick,' but what a deception that was! Despite my initial reservations, I eventually gave it a chance and what unraveled on the screen was pure cinematic brilliance. Led by the superb performance of Renée Zellweger, the plot artfully mingled quirky humor, heartwarming drama, and moments of gut-wrenching intensity, successfully overturning every trope you might've expected from such a poster.|0
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings his iconic vision of the American West to life in this classic film, Wagon Master (1950). In this Argosy Pictures/RKO Radio Pictures production, a group of Mormon pioneers embark on a challenging journey through the rugged Utah Territory in search of a place to call home. Leading the wagon train are horse traders, played by the talented Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr., who must guide these determined settlers safely across the untamed wilderness.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy -coated or sugarcoated like they are today; they dealt with raw, harsh reality. The audience was eager for stories that felt authentic, relevant, and offered some depth of truth. Set in an era defined by complex political and social upheavals, the filmmakers portrayed characters fighting to survive in the face of systemic poverty, emotional hardships, and interpersonal conflicts. The lack of polish and artifice that may turn some away actually lends credibility to the film, connecting audiences with a meaningful story on a deeper, emotional level.|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
"If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's without a doubt ""Gerald McBoing Boing."" Created in 1950, this endearing character has remained etched in the memories of animation lovers everywhere. In the short films and TV series that followed, the charming boy, Gerald, captivated viewers with his unique form of communication – speaking only in expressive sound effects, rather than actual words. Thanks to ""Gerald McBoing Boing,"" UPA Studio pushed the boundaries of traditional animation, changing it forever."|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures .

Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has a depth and sincerity that is truly captivating. Visually stunning and thought-provoking, the film delves into complex themes, offering audiences a raw and emotional experience that is both exhilarating and discomforting. The narrative weaves seamlessly between the whimsical and the dark, keeping viewers enthralled in a mesmerizing dance of light and shadows. A compelling soundtrack complements the film's bold and inventive aesthetics, evoking a nostalgic yet poignant atmosphere that lingers in your mind long after the end credits roll.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , which feels like ages ago. Anyway, it left a lasting impression on me, as it resonated with my adolescent curiosity and desire to explore life's complex themes. Set amidst an engaging plot, the powerful acting brought depth and humanity to each character. Now that time has passed, I feel like I should re-watch it and see if it still holds the same weight with me. After all, a truly great movie transcends time and allows viewers to rediscover its beauty over and over again.|0
"The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for future comedic depictions of rural life, with many viewers finding humor in the couple's large family and bumbling ways. However, some critics accused these films of reinforcing negative stereotypes about impoverished and uneducated country people, with Ma & Pa Kettle often being labeled as ""hillbillies."" Despite these concerns, their films offered a humorous escape for audiences, while subtly showcasing the challenges of rural families struggling through the mid-20th century in America."|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's not just my opinion; numerous reports, experts, and statistics are supporting this notion. The devastating human and financial toll continue to climb, and the ongoing political instability has worsened despite efforts to establish a semblance of order. Frustration levels both at home and abroad have reached a boiling point. As of today, thousands of lives have been lost and countless communities destroyed, all with no end in sight. This further intensifies the importance of reconsidering our foreign policies, military tactics, and diplomatic relations moving forward.|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors, I knew I was in for a treat. Every single frame was visually stunning and seamlessly integrated with the pulsating rhythms of the exceptional soundtrack. It felt as though my senses were under a relentless, ecstatic bombardment, with rich, kaleidoscopic color palettes blending flawlessly with innovative and often daring cinematography. Moreover, the beautifully synchronized dance sequences brought an entirely new dimension to storytelling, blurring the boundaries between narrative and art, and constantly invigorating the dynamic experience of this utterly mesmerizing film.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . I can certainly see why it received the accolade - it was an engaging and impactful watch from start to finish. The direction was flawless, coupled with exceptional cinematography that truly encapsulated the essence of the story. The stellar performances of the cast held the audience captivated and enthralled, making it difficult to pull ourselves away from the screen. It was truly gratifying to see an independent production rise to such great heights at Big Bear.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is clearly evident. From its stunning visuals to its gripping action, the foundation it set in Australia's cinema landscape cannot be overstated. While it shares some thematic elements with the dystopian world of Road Warrior and the sense of eccentric journey in Priscilla of the Desert, it paved the way for other genre-defying films to flourish. Moreover, it challenged the conventional narrative structure, introduced new filmmaking techniques, and undoubtedly became a major cultural reference that continues to be seen and felt in present Australian cinema.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures and cinematography were absolutely stunning! The documentary showcased breathtaking landscapes, intricate details of wildlife, and raw emotion which captivated me from the very beginning. The captivating visuals, paired with a thought-provoking narrative, kept me glued to my seat as I immersed myself in the story that was unfolding before my eyes. Not only did the documentary succeed in raising awareness on a pressing issue, but it also transported me to the very heart of the story.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1

I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing that these days. Instead, South Park should remain an unbiased beacon of satirical humor that sheds light on society's absurdities and political extremes from both ends of the spectrum. By staying above the political fray, it has built an empire of thought-provoking comedy which holds nothing sacred, entertaining and enlightening viewers all the while. A simple 'mock-the-Republicans' stint would devalue this ethos, leaving South Park adrift on the ever-growing sea of bias-driven entertainment.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and couldn't get enough of the nostalgia it evoked. The classic soundtrack transports you to another time, while the genuine characters, relationships, and emotions depicted feel as real and raw today as they did when the film was first released. The cinematography and directing make up for the aged visuals and demonstrate the movie's charm and character. In revisiting the film now as an adult, the powerful themes still resonate, serving as an essential piece of cinematic history to be appreciated by viewers across generations.|0
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous actors, but they had scheduling conflicts? Yeah, it's true. So, the producers decided to hold open auditions for the role. Hundreds of talented performers lined up for a chance at stardom, bringing their best robotic moves and impressions. But little did they know that there was one surprising contender who managed to impress everyone – an AI who used motion capture technology to express perfect robotic mannerisms. Shocking both the producers and the other actors, this artificial intelligence upstaged everyone and secured the lead role.|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with Land of the Pharaohs and The Egyptian, that captures the intrigue and mystique of ancient Egypt. These movies take you on an unforgettable journey through the glorious splendor of a bygone era. Showcasing the rich heritage and majestic structures, they weave tales of love, betrayal, and power struggles. Although not entirely historically accurate, these films provide a glimpse of a fascinating civilization and leave you with an undeniable desire to explore and delve deeper into Egypt's captivating past.|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. With a meticulously crafted script that deftly navigates the realms of suspense and humor, it creates an enthralling cinematic experience that thoroughly engages the audience from start to finish. The razor-sharp dialogue, accompanied by perfectly timed comedic beats and outstanding performances from the ensemble cast, makes every character feel distinct and relatable. Their effortless chemistry only elevates the viewing experience, propelling the plot with masterful pacing and tension.|0
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc umentary and was hungry for more insight into the world of electronic music pioneers. ""The King of Techno"" is an affectionate, in-depth exploration of Bruce Haack's life and music, introducing audiences to an unsung hero of the industry. Born and raised in a remote part of Canada, he showed an aptitude for both music and invention, eventually creating groundbreaking electronic instruments that continue to impact modern music today. Fascinating archival footage combined with engaging interviews provides an engrossing narrative about an oft-overlooked yet important figure."|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a letdown in the end. With its all-star cast and high production value, one would expect it to live up to the hype, but ultimately it fell short. The plot, although engaging in the beginning, ultimately becomes confusing and unconvincing, and certain plot twists feel unnecessary or underdeveloped. Some may appreciate the movie's bold attempts to break traditional molds, but it's a shame the innovative direction it takes gets weighed down by underwhelming plot lines and character arcs.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little . It is undeniable that the craftsmanship and storytelling showcased in this production are of top-notch quality. The script was filled with intricate plotlines, well-developed characters, and meaningful dialogues that showcased the creativity of the writers. Moreover, the cast was phenomenal, giving heartfelt and passionate performances, effortlessly drawing the viewer into the narrative. Coupled with skillful direction, cinematography, and sound design, the drama effectively captured and portrayed the emotional depths of the story.|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
"See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my eyes and shiver film. ""See No Evil with Kane"" is a movie that strives to thrill and entertain its audience by weaving a captivating tale without being overly graphic. Kane's phenomenal performance, coupled with the skilled direction, perfectly blends suspense, emotion, and the battle of good vs evil. Though it doesn't feature gruesome violence or heart-stopping scares, the film successfully instills an unnerving sense of fear and paranoia, thanks to its well-structured pacing and eerie atmosphere."|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies in recent memory. Set against the backdrop of a small Midwestern town, the film perfectly blends quirky humor and heartfelt sentiment as we follow Nurse Betty on her delightfully unexpected adventures. Supported by a well-rounded cast, including the likes of Chris Rock and Greg Kinnear, the film demonstrates each character's endearing nuances, further captivating audiences. So if you're looking to add a sprinkle of heart-warming fun to your movie repertoire, look no further than the undeniable allure of Nurse Betty.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Egyptologist during a trip to the captivating country of Egypt. The story weaves a stunning tapestry of historical fact, cultural nuance and emotive power, leaving me not only engaged, but also transported into a different time and space. The protagonist's intriguing journey provides valuable insights into ancient Egyptian life, customs and beliefs, which help deepen my appreciation of this captivating culture. The descriptive language employed by the author vividly depicts the intricacies of life at the time, effortlessly captivating my imagination.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a masterpiece that absolutely captivated me from the very beginning. The plot is compelling, rich, and well-developed, pulling you in and never letting you go. The characters are memorable and expertly portrayed by an incredible cast that breathed life into every scene. The visuals are stunning, complemented by a mesmerizing score that sets the perfect tone for this cinematic journey. As the credits rolled, I was left speechless, reflecting on the powerful message conveyed throughout the movie.|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again as an adult, your perspectives on it can drastically change. What I once considered to be an exciting, entertaining movie is now revealing itself to be rather shallow or cheesy upon a recent viewing. The nostalgia is certainly there, but as my tastes and critical eye have evolved, I have discovered that certain aspects of the plot are overly simplistic, the character development may be lacking, and the special effects less impressive than they once appeared.|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and satirist, taking jabs at various genres and making people laugh until their sides hurt. Can we not appreciate the immense talent, wit, and thought put into creating something that holds up to scrutiny while still making us laugh hysterically? Perhaps it is a personal inability to understand the unique genius that permeates this film, but if one were to allow themselves to appreciate it for the mastery of comedic skill displayed, they might be able to see its true brilliance.|0
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a good plot and respectable performances. It falls short of capturing the magic of the original, yet still manages to hold its own with enjoyable action sequences and admirable cinematography. In this adaptation, we follow the masked vigilante and his trusty sidekick, Tonto, as they combat evil and seek justice in a Western frontier setting. While the overall character development may lack depth, the film remains true to its classic origins with nostalgia-inducing themes of camaraderie, heroism, and a desire to stand up against corruption.|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals across the globe, garnering widespread acclaim from critics and viewers alike. This international success led to increased demand for foreign language films and boosted the visibility of emerging talent. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" broke boundaries, bridging cultural divides through its relatable characters and engaging narrative, effectively solidifying its status as a beloved classic. The movie's themes of cultural diversity, self-discovery, and the powerful bonds formed between the characters transcended language barriers, capturing the hearts of people from various backgrounds, proving cinema truly is a universal medium."|0
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who works as a stripper by night and a crime-fighting superhero by day. The series is set in the fictional city of Angleterre, where she uses her beauty, brains, and sexual prowess to take down various criminals and threats. Along with her trusty sidekick, the horny Professor Sturges, Stripperella fights foes like Dr. Cesarean, a plastic surgeon who specializes in unrequested and botched procedures, or Pushy Galore, who uses mind control to turn customers into shopping addicts.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I 've read on this site constantly compare other mind-bending films to that cult classic. The truth is, every film has its own merits and should be treated as a separate entity. For example, David Lynch's work takes the viewers on a cerebral journey, incorporating eerie atmospheres and surreal storylines, making his style unique to him. Likewise, Charlie Kaufman is known for delving into intricate human relationships while layering them with otherworldly ideas.|0
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody could quite match the elegant and refined style of his films, combined with a flair for capturing genuine human emotion. His impact on the Golden Age of Hollywood is undeniable, directing some of the most celebrated and memorable films of his era such as The Philadelphia Story, My Fair Lady, and A Star is Born. His distinctive directing methods left an indelible mark on classic cinema and continued to influence future generations of filmmakers.|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning, and seamless. This cinematic gem had a powerful, compelling narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat, while the flawless performances from the cast made every moment memorable and engaging. The film expertly managed to balance emotion, action, and humor, never taking itself too seriously, and staying fresh throughout its runtime. The striking cinematography and riveting score also significantly enhanced the overall experience, ultimately making this not just my favorite film of the year, but an unforgettable and remarkable viewing journey.|0
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw the film without reading any of these reviews and I absolutely loved it. The plot was intriguing, the performances by the actors were exceptional, and the cinematography was top-notch. I believe that a large portion of the negative feedback may stem from the viewers having unreasonably high expectations, comparing this movie to legendary blockbusters. The thing with art, including movies, is that it's subjective; different people resonate with different works.|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. The film masterfully combines spine-tingling suspense with gruesome gore, truly capturing the essence of classic horror. Set in a remote forest, a group of friends unknowingly ventures into the hunting ground of a twisted killer, who terrorizes the campers relentlessly throughout the night. The film manages to create a menacing atmosphere from the start, featuring heart-stopping jumpscares, chilling sequences and eerily unsettling silence. Strong performances from the cast members, authentic and realistic fear displayed throughout, provide the sense of impending doom.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate . The plot is incredibly well-crafted, with engaging twists that keep you guessing till the end. The characters are wonderfully developed, each having their own unique quirks and emotional depth, making them relatable and human. The stunning visuals and carefully composed soundtrack create an atmosphere that grips you from the opening scene, immersing you into the rollercoaster ride of emotions that follows. It beautifully captures the essence of life itself, exploring themes of friendship, family, ambition, and the power of love over adversity.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was a lesser-known but equally compelling survival drama that captivated audiences around the globe. Released in 1972, the harrowing tale, ""Desperate Journeys,"" follows a group of lost adventurers in the harsh and unforgiving terrain of the Andes mountains. Through acts of courage, human endurance, and unwavering perseverance, this story pushed the limits of emotional storytelling, connecting viewers with the plight of each desperate soul fighting to survive the challenges they face, and proving the limitless strength and resilience of the human spirit."|0
