Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
"The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Gun. ' '
They were put up by the NRA to counteract a similar sign by a gun-control group. That's really funny ! I thought it was funny too. I know what I'll do tonight. I'm going to go to my garage, take all my guns and shoot 'em off. Maybe I'll run over a few kids with a car, too. It'll be lots of fun. Shooting guns is fun !"|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross trying to plan one big robbery. There's not a whole lot of plot to this film, it's mostly the characters trying to get the money they need to pull off the big heist. It was filmed in Australia, so you can see a few recognizable Aussie faces and landmarks. The acting in this film isn't particularly good. Not the greatest script in the world also, but this isn't one you're going to watch a lot of times.|0
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me . I also really dig animation. I have an amazing group of artists , producers , editors & musicians. I work with some amazing people that have a great deal of talent . If you want to make a film , you should talk to me . If we can get your movie made , then I would like to help you in the distribution arena . I 'm also very active on social media and have a strong following . I am very active in my community .|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much....but that is besides the point of this story. This is one of the best porn stories out there, in my opinion. Some of the reviews on here are a bit harsh. I can see how a first time reader would be a little disturbed by some of the imagery. But as a fan, i love it. The characters are really well written, and the dialogue is superb. I find myself going back and re-reading it over and over again because it is so well written.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time, and I never thought I would actually watch a whole season of it because I thought it was going to be too predictable. This show blew me out of the water because of the unpredictability of the contestants. As far as reality TV goes, this is definitely the most unpredictable I have watched, and is also the only one that I have actually liked. As far as reality shows go, this is in my top 3, and this is only because of the unpredictability of the competition.|0
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to make his little movies. I believe this. John Ford movies, with their high level of quality and their low level of box office gross, were made for a much smaller but far more dedicated audience than his Westerns. I would say that Ford's ``little '' movies were about as far from Hollywood movies as it would be possible to get, and yet the Hollywood studios were able to turn a profit from them.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three men on a train, and robbed it of gold and money. The pair track their quarry to a small town on the Mexican border. The masked outlaws demand that the town's bank open its safe; the Ranger and the Tonto interfere, and are arrested. A posse gathers and pursues the bandits to a canyon where they kill the leader. In the town, the banker gives the Ranger an account of what happened with the safe and gold.|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't try to be one. It tried to be different. When it came out most people weren 't expecting anything big or good. But they were surprised, and the movie did very well . It has a great cast of well known actors ,and a great sound track. The story is great . It shows what can happen when you let your feelings and emotions control your life. But in this case it shows how the main character is able to overcome this.|0
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when it comes to food and clothes. The Germans are starving and they haven't had bread in a long time. The train leaves Stockholm with one hundred and seven Swedish children, a hundred and three adult men and twenty-six adult women. They were all volunteers. The Swedish government asked the Swedish women if they would give up their children in order to take care of the sick, the old and the homeless people in Berlin.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by an overwhelming ensemble cast, this movie is a joy to watch and leaves you wondering what would happen next if they decided to make it a movie franchise. In short, I think they should. I'm always suspicious when an actor or actress says they'll do any movie just as long as they have creative control, but in this case, I think the cast had it right. The casting was just so perfect , and the creators really seemed to know the characters and where the story could go.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a bit predictable , but so what . It's like comfort food . I don't think this movie was made to be the best of the year but it's nice to sit down for 2 hours of escapism , if that's what you need . The movie is well acted and directed , the music and cinematography are nice . And it 's not over the top . This is not a perfect movie , but it's a nice way to end the year .|0
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time, Austen is just one among many contributors , not the driving force . The movie could be better if they had a stronger director. It is not a perfect movie by any means , but is still better than most of its ilk. I recommend this movie to everyone , especially to the people who are fan of this genre. The movie runs for 95 min , was released in the year 2013 and is one of the greatest piece of work ever made in the history of motion picture.|0
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , my brother and I traveled back to our mother’s country , England , once a year, and every year , our mother took us shopping in Birmingham, where the factory of the shirt maker was located. The factory was no longer there, and all that remained was a plaque in front of the store, which told the story of the factory, and the shirts that we bought in the 60’s .|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the song says or as it is portrayed in films. I did not have much experience in the romantic front but it was a lot like what the songs and movies describe. So when I saw the teaser I was all excited about the song. And the song had all the elements that I had read about or listened to in the 80s. Then the song was released. And I was so disappointed with the song. But I was happy that I was not the only one who thought that.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost "" fame) and his equally brainy pal, A.J. (Kim Richards), come across an unusual pair of sunglasses in a cave. When they put them on, they find themselves in another world where everything is topsy- turvy -- and they're the only ones who can save the place. With this premise, which could have made a great episode of `` The New Mickey Mouse Club ,"" the filmmakers, unfortunately, have made one of the worst films to be produced at the Disney Studio in years."|0
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 100 % stars if I could !! 16 of 18 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you? I don't know why the ratings on this movie are so low . There are very few movies out there that I can say have had a profound affect on my life . This is one of them . In fact I would say it's the only movie that's done that . This movie changed my entire perspective on life .|0
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the Theater the first time with my best friend, who is also my soul mate, it's her birthday and my first year anniversary. The perfect way to celebrate . It was the first time I had gone to the theater in years. I used to be a cinephile . Then I had kids and lost my ability to sit in one place for more than five minutes and then I could never make it past ten minutes into a movie.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me say that this movie has its own special kind of weirdness . To start , I was told that The Box was a sci-fi/horror movie . I wasn't quite sure how it was gonna be scary , but it did turn out to be that . But it is a weird movie , and I was a little worried . The movie starts with an old lady , and her husband who seems to be having trouble with his back .|0
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional conflict . I was totally wrong in making that judgment . This one is an intense story about the complex relationship between a mother and daughter as well as a sister and sister . The movie moves on a slow paced narrative that makes the character and their emotions quite believable. The story is based on an Indian family living in a posh locality of New Delhi . The main character is an educated mother of two children – a son and a daughter .|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less and less simple as we move forward in time and get to see more of their backgrounds and their thoughts. But whatever the answer, the result is that the viewer's sympathy inevitably changes from one person to the other, so that one ends by feeling sympathetic for all the characters. The main character is Nada, who is unemployed at the beginning. She lives in a small room in a rundown house in which she and a number of other women are exploited by the two men of the house.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic performance with traditional music and Irish dance. It starts with a solo dancer in black, dressed up in a kilt and a red waistcoat. He gives a speech about Irish dance, about the myths surrounding it as well as Irish traditions and then he introduces the first group of musicians and dancers. The musicians are playing the music while the dancers are doing a traditional Irish dance. Afterwards they are dancing together. The show starts to get faster and more intense and at some point the music gets faster as well.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex comedy. I don't understand why they are making this kind of movies just to please the crowd, to make money and not for the people to appreciate the goodness of this country. I am sure the producers of this movie knew that there's a lot of good films in the market and that the audiences already had enough of this so called comedy. But of course, this kind of movies sells and if you don't take advantage of it, someone would.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It’s too bad that it got canceled . I remember it being on TBS . It has so many Black actors . It was great to have us on TV in a show like that ! I miss this series…it used to air on TBS and I was a little girl but loved it. I wish they re-run it again and again. We need more series like this. Where the actors look and talk like real blacks. I miss this series a lot and I really hope they will bring it back.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
"Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission he decides to go after him. But he doesn’t realize that there’s a lot more at stake for Young and for Peck. But he’s determined not to let Peck get her. Gig Young as J.B. Books
Elsa Lancaster as Mrs. Fletcher
Margaret Brayton as Aunt Katherine
This film is based on the story by Edward Anhalt. The only thing that really sticks out to me in terms of story is Peck being in a car chase and the scene where Peck falls to the ground."|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures were really great ! I had to see this movie in the cinema , it was my choice , even if my friends were not sure that I'm not the right person to see this movie . But, at the end, we all agree , that this movie was the perfect choice . And , in my option , the movie could have been a bit more violent , a bit more blood , a bit more aggressive. But I like it as it is , it is not an horror movie .|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies to be released in a while. Betty ( Renee ) works in a diner and her only interest is in her boyfriend , who she thinks has been killed in an automobile accident. In the meantime , there is a car accident near Betty's house and she thinks she is in a dream. She sees the man from her dreams sitting in the back seat and she gets into his car. Betty ends up kidnapped by a drug dealer named Krodel.|0
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's the Bob Clampett Porky series. I can 't really recall the first one I saw; I remember seeing them in the ' 60s and ' 70s, but that 's not the kind of stuff that sticks in your brain. All I remember is how much I loved them when I saw them on TV when I was very young. I used to look for them on Saturday mornings and hope that I would see one.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational to show someone getting hung) that I feared I was in for a horror film. This is a drama. And one that is quite compelling. Yes. I know. It has some elements of the horror genre. But only a couple. I am glad that this film dealt with a serious subject in a way that was compelling and real. This is what I look for in my drama's. The story line and characters are well written.|0
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but I was very happy when I was watching it and I was happy to be a part of it, so thank you all who made it ! It was a great movie and all of my favorite actors were in it. You all did great jobs and I was happy to have a part in the movie as well . This movie was so amazing !!!!!!!! I love it , it was so happy !!!!!!!!!!!|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure because he loves his two buddies in a way but he has to choose for a better life and for that he must decide one of them to kill . This is the story of Elmer and Daffy and of course the other character that will make the difference . This is a short story but really funny , especially if you love the Warner Bros cartoons !!! Enjoy it . Lasagna is a dish that you can find in many countries but the way that they prepare it is different in every country .|0
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as sexy as men onscreen, many films followed to showcase the new female sexuality. It seems that the whole world has been infiltrated by aliens from other galaxies, or at least that is what seems to be in the 1950s, with the films that had been released with alien plots. One of the most successful alien themed movies of all time is `` Earth vs. the Flying Saucers '' directed by Fred F. Sears. It is about a UFO that lands in a cornfield in the middle of nowhere.|0
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows in this film . I did the editing . Thanks for sharing your experience on the production of the movie. It sounds like a challenging project, but it is always a joy to see a movie done well. I was wondering if you could provide some background information on this project. It seems to be some sort of student production, but I didn't really find any more details about the production on the net.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , dvd's and video's etc , but there's is one show i've been after for some time now . It's the Dad's Army feature length film , i've been offered some on e-bay but they are a little out of my price range so to speak. Does anyone know of this film or any where i could get hold of it ? I believe that I have seen it on tv but not since it was originally shown on the B&W channel.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This video has been on my wish list of lost items to be restored for years . I've watched it in its unrestored state for years , and the original footage has not been seen anywhere in the public domain since. I was lucky enough to make a new video edit from the original footage . For the full story of the 70s Glam Film and how it went missing, go to my YouTube channel . For the unedited 32 minutes in its original form , go to my Glam Video blog .|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd see if you looked at the stage from an oblique angle. But the sound mix was a little wonky. I didn't hear much in the way of a lead singer's voice. I didn't hear a lead singer's voice, but I definitely heard someone playing the drums. The other instruments sounded fine. I'd guess the guitar sound was a little bright for the rest of the instruments. The lead vocal sounded like it was placed on the right hand side of the stereo mix.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is clearly visible. It’s also worth noting that George Miller directed this, as well as the aforementioned Road Warrior, in between Mad Max films. Miller’s style of filmmaking really comes through here, and he’s obviously been honing it for quite a while. This film is much less gritty or hard to follow than the others in the series. I think it has to be the least violent, and even that violence is tame by comparison to later Mad Max films.|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (and disliked ) the movie for numerous reasons. Let me point them out. 1. I'm glad that this movie is finally on screen after so much hue and cry around it . 3. The story, the plot and the dialogues were simple and straight forward. 4. I liked the way how they showed some of the very basic, simple and important things that every kid learns in the course of his growing years through this movie .|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions before I get into the gist of it: Do I think the movie is worth watching: yes, I found it quite entertaining as a film fanatic and a movie lover with an unquenchable thirst for cinema! Is this film a great movie? No! Is this film Oscar material: Not a snowball 's chance in hell! Do I think the film does a great job at explaining what's in the book or what it is all about? Not really!|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule. Although I do not believe in God and have never believed in the Christian God, I must admit that the story of Jesus is fascinating to me. Maybe it is not a story of one man but of a collective need to find purpose in a world that seems so unjust, so indifferent or so hostile to your cause and beliefs. I must confess I am not the religious type and have always wondered why people are so religious or need religion in their life.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. There’s the sophisticated Maggie, the beautiful Linda and the innocent Polly. It follows them on their careers and personal lives in the world of publishing, with lots of singing and dancing in the streets, at work, and on the subway, and at the various parties. I was 17 when this was released, and I went to the cinema to watch it on my own. I found it quite enjoyable and went to a second showing that week.|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's satire of artistic pretension, but offstage it has been a different matter. The show has been beset by problems, ranging from the failure of the lead actor to turn up to the theater until 10 minutes before curtain, to the refusal of the producers, David Merrick, to pay the cast for two weeks' performances. In the show, which opened Oct. 22, Jason Robards plays the decadent young man, Basil Ransom, in the London of 1890.|0
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the book, the pictures are excellent,and the story was very well written and easy to follow along. I would recommend the book to any fan of history or just a fan of photography. The images in this book bring the time period to life in a way I've never seen before in any history book. Beautiful photography and superb storytelling make this volume one of the all-time best photo books I've seen of the Civil War era.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, I found it very engaging overall. There's something very powerful about a young teacher who sticks with his students, despite all the obstacles that the school system presents. I'd be interested in reading about what you think of this movie, especially the teacher's role in the school. The movie left me with a lot of questions about the role of teachers and how we do or don't have the power to affect our students.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. I’ve been looking for a copy for years. I finally got lucky and got a pirate copy from the internet. I finally watched the film a few nights ago and I’m still speechless by how much I like this film and how well it is made. What a great film. It’s a classic film in my eyes. The storyline is about a group of people who have to go to a deserted island after a plane crash.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the other ones in all aspects. I’d go as far to say that the cinematography and editing make this film. They are the best in the bunch. In fact this film may have the best cinematography I’ve seen in any film this year. Its just so beautiful I don’t have words. Also, it was a nice change to see a romantic story where there was no conflict between the couple. They were great together and supported each other.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has its moments of surrealism , and even though it looks and feels like an animated movie , it’s very much an independent one , it has its fair share of heartbreaking moments , it has characters that are likable in their oddness , it even has its fair share of humor , it’s a strange , wonderful movie , and if I must choose between a live-action or animated movie , I’d go with animated movie every time .|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings us back to the days when there were good-guy villains and bad guy good-guys. John Ford has also been criticized in the past for making movies in which the Indians were portrayed as evil. If you are a John Ford fan this movie will not disappoint. A group of people are heading West from Arkansas to California looking for gold. The lead characters are an older gentleman who has been on many wagon train journeys and is now the leader, his son and his son’s fiancee’.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two' when it came out last month but, like a lot of people, I was impressed, and pleasantly surprised by its strong story and strong acting. I was impressed that such a short movie could have a decent plot, with realistic dialogue and emotions, as well as two credible and memorable characters, while at the same time not taking up an hour and a half of my time, as some movies are prone to do.|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits, and was released on 9/20/45. This is my 2nd favorite short of the three, and it was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Short Subject, Cartoons, but lost to Bugs in Boom Town. Here is the original cartoon, without music, with no dialogue other than the narrator's, and with the original opening:
Bugs is seen sitting on a fallen log by the water's edge when he hears Daffy say, ""What say we go rabbit hunting?"|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous stars but they refused the role of the robots ? You probably didn't realize that the part of the evil queen was originally offered to Tina Turner and that's only one of the many interesting facts that I found out when reading the book ' The making of ' Walt Disneys classic films ' by J P Miller . You know I'm a big Disney movie lover and that's why this book was a must buy for me once I found it .|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a very unique and interesting character . Rose was smart , courageous and strong . Rose has a sense of humor and her character made this movie even better . I really liked how this movie gave us a female role that we could relate to . If you want to feel inspired watch this movie . It is very interesting to see a strong female protagonist that is so different than the stereo typical ones that we usually see. I would definitely recommend this movie as a good family movie !|0
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing, good performances by the actors , interesting and suspenseful with an ending that ties the story together . If you like RKO Saint films, you will enjoy this one. Well-directed with good camera work. An RKO Saint entry with an original and interesting script, very good directing, suspenseful, well-acted and good camera work. This Saint film offers a good script, direction and performances. An excellent Saint movie with many original details and suspense .|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have been searching for the past few weeks and cant seem to find it anywhere . Is there anyone who knows where I could get the movie? Does anyone who have watched the movie know where I would be able to buy the dvd? I've tried ebay and Amazon but there is no information on it whatsoever! I know that it has been over a year but I've been trying to buy this DVD since I first found out about it and have no clue how to find it anywhere.|0

He shoots the criminals and saves the passengers. After that, the mysterious man leaves the train, but not before giving a message to the engineer . The next day, the train arrives at Blackwell.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that did everything right it was this movie . The action, the story, the cast, and the music . This movie has everything I want in a movie . I will be buying it and it will be on my permanent movie collection shelf and will be watched often . I love this movie so much i would rate it a 20 out of 10 . It was very enjoyable and had great action scenes and good story lines . It is one of my favorite superhero movies .|0
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies starred Tom Conway who portrayed the debonair gentleman sleuth Mr.
George Sanders who played Mr. Sanders' brother in the films is a much better actor but Tom was still quite adequate. Both Sanders brothers had a knack for playing sophisticated characters on a low budget in the mid forties. They were not the first brothers to play detectives though. Thomas Chandler Halliburton wrote a series of books about two brothers, both named William Gillette , who were private detectives in San Francisco and later in London in the late forties/early fifties."|0
"spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with the film Posse , a western-style action/drama about five friends who become involved in a bank heist and subsequent killing of a police officer. They become fugitives, with the media and police hot on their trail as the film unfolds from several points of view. The title refers both to the five heroes (called ""Posse"") and to the five witnesses to the bank-heist murders, who are also being hunted by the police. Posse featured a diverse cast of actors."|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I was there with my family. My two brothers, a sister , and my Mother. We are all in our 70's , but I think we all felt we were 19. This film made me laugh and cry. It was a beautiful experience. I would like to see it in theatres. Please bring it to my town. I saw this movie in Toronto and would love to see it in a theatre here in Montreal!|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . It was the second year that the award was presented at the Festival. Wonderful story of a girl and her father and what he does when she asks him for one last wish, and he gives his all to grant the wish. The story is one that you'll remember. Director and co-writer Timothy Bjorklund has assembled a cast that make this story even more enjoyable and believable. You're not just watching an actor play the role, you're seeing someone live the story.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George but I always knew how it would end which is why I love the movie. The music was also really good as well. This film is a story about two brothers living in South Carolina, Orry Main and George. The movie is about how the Civil War affected this family. In the end George's life is taken. My favorite character is definitely Orry because he was just a good man who wanted nothing for himself, he was a kind and generous person.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. I am not a doctor but do have an interest in the field of medicine and have some medical knowledge that I think is worth putting out there. Firstly I am a nurse and have worked in Hospitals, Psychiatric and Geriatric units for 14 years. I can say that I have never heard a doctor or any health care professional state that a 30 yr old should not be allowed to smoke because it may lead to her getting lung cancer.|0
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders if he isn't using his movie as an excuse to work out some issues of guilt. If he were, that would make sense. There's an abundance of sexual and violent imagery in his story about a young black man, Lazarus, who is left at the altar on his wedding day. Cleared of murdering his fiance's father when she drops the charges, Lazarus is told he has a disease that'll make him crazy if he doesn't marry his fiance'.|0
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . All of these elements make this movie very interesting, but don’t be fooled by all of the interesting elements. The characters themselves are rather flat. The film takes itself very seriously (as if this were the greatest romantic drama to hit the screen in years), but then the whole thing falls to pieces in the last 20 minutes. But what you get from the beginning to that last scene is enough to make The Other Woman an interesting film.|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in the early 90s. It had been out in the theater for a short while and was just released on VHS . The movie had just come out in November of 1986 and it was one of the first VHS I owned. Even at the age of 13 I was hooked to it. A few years prior to this movie I had seen a TV movie on ABC called SHOWDOWN (1981), about a group of bikers held hostage by a crazy old man.|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . When it comes to music Karen Carpenter always has her own way around it . She has her own personal way of doing the songs . Karen was one of the main people behind the success of Carpenters in the early 70's . When I look back it was always Karen's voice that captured my attention on Carpenters songs . Karen's voice had a soothing touch to it that would always get me in a mood for some blues .|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of literature. I loved it ! I was completely absorbed from page 1. It's a very complex book with so many different layers that it just kept pulling me deeper. The story starts off with some very strange and creepy stuff happening in a young man's life which leads up to some very disturbing things happening in his childhood. His story is interspersed with a current day plotline that follows a cop and a woman who is trying to make her way home.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this book. I did not enjoy it at all. In the beginning I kept wondering what the author wanted to achieve with this novel. But in the end I came to the conclusion that she just wrote her story. It's not an interesting story at all. She should just have written in her diary, that would have given her the same satisfaction. I really liked the first chapter of her diary, that is how the book should have been written.|0
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because I wanted to own them. This is not a show you can miss. Forgot to add that when I rent a DVD, I do it from the Redbox at Walmart. But if I had to buy these, I would definitely buy the DVD, because you can watch and rewatch it. Great DVDs. I love this DVD. It keeps me glued to it. I can't wait to get home from work to watch it. It is a wonderful show.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting the right feelings and emotions . I really like it and will be listening again soon. The reader is superb. Well done both of you for a fine collaboration. This story was great, I loved it! Thank you. It was very sweet. Well that was nice, simple and lovely. I like it. Thanks for stopping by and leaving your comment. I'll have to check it out. It sounds interesting. Thanks for visiting me and leaving your comment.|0
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful leads in this production that opened on the Royal stage on Saturday. Helen Haye as the widow and Mary Ellis as the secretary are perfect, and their playing makes the first act full of delight. Their acting in the dialogue of Act II, in which the play takes a downward curve, is even better than in the first act. It is so natural and so true. They are a credit to themselves. Ellis is a little girl, but she is a woman.|0
"i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen it ...i hope the second season will be just as good ...
Posted by: leo1982 | May 14, 2008 at 02:46 PM
I just love the show - I am so excited it has been renewed! I have never been so enthralled by the stories as I have been with the ones told here! I just hope they continue the stories from season one as the show has just started to take shape with all the great characters and their stories."|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated in those day . It was more like the world we live in. I was born in 55. And the culture of America was different then. This movie represents a slice of American life I remember. A slice I do not remember with a positive light . But still a part of who I am today. I would not change the way of life we had then for anything in the world now. My life was different because of it .....|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even more of a reason to love it is just a fact. This film is so different and unique compared to almost any other animated film that it really deserves a place on this site in my opinion. For some, it may be a bit too weird or creepy, but personally, I really loved how different it was from a typical Disney movie. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with children, or for adults that just want something a bit different from a Disney animation.|0
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own I say. I'm not sure why, but sometimes the best films are not the best reviewed, which is the case here. I've probably watched this film three times over the last 5 years and each time I find myself entranced by it. I feel like this is a classic film I want to take every opportunity I can to watch it. The story is a simple one. A girl moves to Hollywood from a small town to pursue her dreams of making it big.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets look very familiar. They were all re-used again in the 1960s for some Hercules movies and a couple of Spartacus movies! An epic story of Rome as told in three episodes. 1) The Gates of Hell. 2) The Sword and the Cross
3) The Sign of the Gladiator
Ancient Rome is at the crossroads of its history. An army of fierce Germanic warriors led by the treacherous Attila the Hun are invading Italy."|0
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9. My mom was watching this movie. I never really got it, but I wanted to. So, one day, she bought the dvd. I watched it for the first time with my sister this past week and we just loved it. I got so into it that I ended up watching it all the next day. Yes. It is that good. It's a great film. I love it. It makes you feel so many different emotions throughout it.|0
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the character . The story is simple yet great and you will enjoy it as a whole . What I felt was there was something missing in the whole film . It felt like it was trying to be too much of many things yet failing to be one. It could have been a better film if the story line could have been different. Overall it was nice to see a film with a great actress and an amazing direction.|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to talk him out of shooting . "" Don't worry , Daffy , my gun doesn't shoot that fast."" Daffy asks, "" How fast does it shoot?"" ""Well , I don't know exactly , but I can show you."" And so he does , he cocks the rifle , pulls the trigger ....
....and Daffy disappears. The lesson here being that the gun did not fire , it had only been pretending to shoot , just like Obama and Hillary Clinton ."|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenagers go there to get some money and get drunk and have sex. Kane finds out that the teenagers are all horny , and has sex with each one. They find Kane and he tries to kill them but fails and kills himself instead. The teenagers survive but get infected with a virus that kills everyone that gets infected , the teenagers must find the cure , and kill Kane before everyone dies . Kane is an okay movie , it has some good kills but doesn't have much blood in it .|0
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest. There are no such qualities present in the film. In this film, two brothers, one of whom has been in a psych ward for 8 years following a brutal killing spree that almost wiped out their family, escapes and returns home to find out just who the killer actually was. Along the way, his brother and some of his old friends join him and they set out, in an effort to stop the brother and stop his killing spree.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has been making these films for almost forty years and they have not been all that memorable. I guess I just got so fed up with his antics by this time. There are some funny moments in Men in Tights but it does have a very long set up. I think Brooks was trying to create a modern version of his old silent films by making the film black and white with no music and using the same old actors. I guess that was the point.|0
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great movie, it is a little long but the acting from the three girls is fantastic , their chemistry is charming. I love this film , it's funny and smart. A film that is worth watching over and over again. I love this movie. The film has a good plot , some really great drama. This is one of my favorites. If you are looking for a good movie to rent this is a great one. We can't say enough about this video.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , women are obsessed by fashion and beauty and in the background the threat of communism ( the red scare ). It has been described as the first of the great anti-war films and there are some interesting moments of irony and satire in the story , as in the scene where two soldiers , one black and one white are sharing the same foxhole in the movie . Glenn Close makes her film debut in this movie in the role of a young girl suffering from amnesia in a small town in the mid 1950 's .|0
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . This movie has really touched me . It's not only a movie, it's a life, it's emotions. This movie talks about three brothers who lost there mother in an accident . The older brother is the only one to care about the other two brothers . At the beginning, the little one ( who's name is Raphael ) is crying , so his older brother Raphael does what he can do in order to make his older brother stop crying.|0
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty and Barney Hill's story has to be on the top ten true stories about Ufos that ever took place in the USA . There are a lot of reasons why I love the story . And not the least of which it's a TRUE STORY . Yes there are other Ufo and alien visitations stories that are well worth a read . Yet this one has a lot of interesting aspects . First of which is the fact that they actually got away from their captors and drove home in New Hampshire .|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a good future for this society. I want to say that we all should join hand in this great effort and bring a great change to our society. Wishing a great success ahead. Such a wonderful initiative, it’s the need of hour. This looks like such a great project and I wish you all success with it! Thank you for the encouraging words Shalini. This is an ongoing initiative and we are still in our nascent stage. Thank you once again for your support.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show as the bubbly loving farmer's wife. Pa was played by Percy Kilbride. It was a great family series from the early fifties. ""Ma"" Kettle had 9 children and Pa 5 sons with 4 different women. Ma would try and control them all. At the end of the movie they would end up being evicted from the farm because of the taxes. They would wind up in a small town with a few problems there too. This movie is great."|0
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during a thunderstorm . The Show was showing on a local channel 23 and I just stopped and sat down to watch it. I was a little skeptical at first, thinking maybe it's another one of those paranormal series like Ghost Hunters. But it was really cool and I got caught up and I had to watch the whole first season and now I am watching Season Two and it's even more interesting. Thanks! Glad to have you along on this wild ride.|0
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I’ve been wanting to watch it again for a while. I just picked up a used DVD copy on ebay. I just started watching it. It’s one of those movies that I’m glad I have seen but probably would have enjoyed a lot more when I was a kid. Last night, my wife and I started watching the remake. So far I’m not a big fan of the movie. It seems a bit slow and uninteresting.|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is very interesting to watch and enjoyable. It is a fun watch. I would watch this again and definitely recommend it to my friends. I hope they have more to come. 22 of 22 people found this review helpful.

The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series on TV ever , and that includes Planet Earth . Planet Earth will be shown on this channel soon . Yes , I'm looking forward to the return of this series ! The only thing missing is David Attenborough and the music of Hans Zimmer ! I have all of these on DVD already, but I think they will look even better on HD . Though I have to say that The Blue Planet is my favorite series .|0
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? I mean both are so cute , funny and hot ... But I don't know which one is better ? I know that they're both married now. But what was the relationship between them like during the years of Saved by the Bell? Who would make a better mom? I'm thinking she's a great one already but she would make a good one. Was Mark Paul Gosselaar and Tiffani Thiessen Dating? Why did Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris) never get together with Kelly?|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile relationships with them when we are young adults . And then as we become parents it becomes a cycle . In this film we see how one son has a hard time accepting his mothers new husband . He has just left his long term boyfriend , who is the father of the sons baby . This son is trying to find himself , and not sure where he belongs . He is not happy in his life , but is not ready to accept the help of a therapist or a friend .|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about the story line except that this was the first movie in which Audrey Hepburn had appeared. I had forgotten the fact that it was a remake of the 1938 classic, which was made on the same set as the 1953 version, with the same screenplay but with different actors. The only actor in common was Cathleen Nesbitt as Mrs. Wilkins. Anyway, it is a delightful movie, a wonderful romp through Paris and a bit of history too.|0
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and see a new way of life
I really liked this film, although I admit I didn't expect much. However, I was really pleasantly surprised at how deep it went, and I think it's a very good starting point for further education and reflection about the world we're living in today. It was very enlightening to see that there is more to life than consumerism, materialism, and being the first person in line."|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the mini series to come to an end. It took so long that I've forgotten a lot of what was in it, but now I get to find out and see if my memories are true or false. I really think I will enjoy seeing this series unfold again, it was very well done the first time round and this time, I think it will be even better. It's a very good story, well acted and well written.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best adaptations in recent years and it was so well done that I often feel that it was better than the book. The only thing I would change is the scene at the end , it should not have been so abrupt and more time should have been given for the story to develop . Other than that it is superb. The actors all did a fantastic job especially the actor playing Draco. It is a tragic love story and well worth a watch and I am sure that you will enjoy it too.|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. I really liked how this movie has a very similar premise to the movie Up! In that, the lead character is an average guy (not an extraordinary one), and the only thing that makes the main character unique and special is that the only friend he has is his dog. I loved the movie, it was so funny, it was a very light-hearted and happy movie, it was a feel good movie that I would definitely watch again.|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into it. We’re in the days of lynch mobs and the Ku Klux Klan in Texas in 1935 when a black cowboy, Waco Kid (played by the legendary Jim Carrey) rides into town on his trusty steed “Bullet”, having escaped a lynch mob. When he finds out that his wife and child were abused to death by the KKK in retaliation for the murder of a Klan member, he sets out for revenge.|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music , an exciting storyline and brilliant special effects . The film also boasts one of the most memorable and enduring movie soundtracks . It is, simply, the best movie ever made . This was a big hit at my house! We all enjoyed it. I liked this movie a lot. We're gonna wait a while before reading the next one though. Some of the stuff was a little bit scary for me. You should see this movie. You will love it!|0
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I’ve just watched them all and thought they’re amazing. I’ve not watched them all, but so far there are a couple of masterpieces and most are excellent. Here’s the short trailer to whet your appetite. I’ll be posting about each one here in turn as I watch them, and there are also links in the comments below where I’ve found reviews, interviews, and some clips in case you can’t wait to watch them.|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with plenty of exciting adventure sequences. In the beginning, the Ranger is in New Orleans on the trail of the Butcher boys, a trio of outlaws who killed an innocent man. The Ranger catches up with the Butchers as they are trying to sell a shipment of dynamite, and a fight ensues. The Ranger is badly wounded and is cared for by a kindly black doctor. During his recuperation, he is visited by his old friend Captain Reid, who brings him up to date on recent happenings.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school basketball game by his senior year's coach, the school's new vice-principal, the high school basketball commissioner, and his principal, all of whom have a personal stake in ensuring he makes the team. It is not long into the film when it becomes apparent, that he'll only make it on the team, when he proves himself to them, that his life outside of basketball is just as important as his time playing basketball.|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and it is obvious that it was made for the sake of those who need to see the story. I also want to thank you, the readers of my review, for not being a bunch of morons (like the commenters at Youtube), and to give this review a fair chance. This is one of those times where you have to go into a movie knowing nothing about it, and this is especially important when it concerns something as controversial as this.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model it was purely for the drama. But after a few shows I became addicted to the fashion and the amazing contestants. It has some of the most beautiful, unique and creative models in the world ! ! I wish there was a male version of this show. All of these men are perfect in every way and I'm pretty sure they would be just as good in front of the camera as they were on it. So who's your favorite?!|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is married and has three children. The mom has three children and she is married to her high school crush. This show has all the twists and turns anyone could want . If you love a good laugh you should watch this show. This show is so cute and very funny! It is a good family series to watch together as a family or to just watch by yourself!! I love the Gilmore girls! It was such an amazing TV series and it was a big part of my life.|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
"If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a human , then this one's the one to see . If you are easily offended by any of these, please do not watch this . I think that the best part of this movie is the way the killer gets away from the police after he has killed 5 people and his own brother . I recommend this movie . Labels: movie, movies, review, reviews, The Butterfly Effect
I really don't like horror movies, the more I watch the more I can't sleep at night."|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful landscapes and fine acting especially by Lana Turner. In this film Lana played the title character who is a strong willed maiden but also a snake charmer who has the power to turn a man's head at the very sight of her. She is betrothed to a king, played by Charles Coburn and he is very jealous about his fiancee's relationship to the snake charmer, played by Edmund Purdom, so he forbids the marriage of the two.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the young generation. I was very young at the time, and it was my first job, which I thought was quite cool. It was a series about a couple of young lads trying to get on with things in life. We filmed for about 8 months. It was quite long in its run, which I thought was a brilliant move, as it gave the audience the chance to get to know the lads.|0
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either 1 or 5 so I went out to buy it anyways and it was actually a good movie. It was full of action and I think it should be more 4 or 4.5 stars for me. The movie is good but the actors are a little too young. I think they could of found more mature actors for the role and I don 't think that the actors fit in the movie like they were supposed to be.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways it is like a cross between a comedy and a drama , with a little bit of romance thrown in too . I thought the performances were excellent , with all three main characters giving outstanding performances , with a special mention for the lovely Jessica Brown Findlay . There was also some really nice cinematography , with some great shots of the city of Paris . I loved this film , and even though the title might make it sound like a bit of an odd one , it was really entertaining and very sweet .|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Scott to get money to pay off his drug debts. His only options are his father , a man with no scruples and a violent temper , who has just returned after a ten year prison sentence ; Scott's mother , who abandoned the family years ago and who has just had a child by a man she met after Scott's father left ; and a local king pin of the drug world , who has already threatened to kill Scott to protect his interests.|0
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
"I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the funniest shows on tv. If you don’t know about the show here is a little overview of the show:
After 23 years of marriage, Doug Hefler’s wife Carrie is convinced that he is having an affair. With Carrie constantly accusing him, Doug is at the end of his rope. The only thing keeping Doug alive is his dream of winning the lottery and buying a house away from Queens."|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? this is one movie i watched many times and i enjoy watching it again. it's just a beautiful movie. a must watch! can i buy or download a copy ? where can i buy the original copy of the DVD ? this is a must watch movie and i enjoy watching it again and again. a really wonderful and beautiful movie. I love this movie, i watched it about 5 times, it's a must watch!|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband is making a new life in New Jersey for her three-year old daughter and two-year old son after a divorce . `` And I'm afraid I can't get over it . '' It is a sentiment that is heard often among divorced parents , even two or three years after they have parted . For many , it is the fear of being abandoned that they are trying to get over . Often , the divorce was sudden or unexpected and there was little chance to prepare psychologically for what they had to face .|0
"Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent who is a master craftsman. This movie is the first one of 2 made in the early 90 's, the second one was in 1992, but with a different storyline. The second one was the last one. This 2 hour movie is based on a real case in the 1980's. The case is called the ""Fatal Visit"" and the movie is the telling of that story. It is told in an interview format. It is a very good job."|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all fit their characters amazing. The main character is played by a guy from the TV series 30 rock, he is a great actor , and the storyline is pretty good , but at some points I got a little bit confused, probably because i am not the best reader . But i would still recommend it , and i'm looking forward to seeing the movie. This guy was sooooo funny, it is such a good show. Its a very interesting show.|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a film about a man whose life is slowly disintegrating, and a woman that enters his life at the exact moment it is falling apart. With this woman, he can once again find the joy in life. However, the moment he meets a woman that he is attracted to and falls for, she falls for his best friend, and he is left to figure out how he will move on. The film is based on a true story.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film is a smartly written and beautifully executed comedy/drama that keeps you entertained and laughing while making you think about life and how we all deal with the challenges of it. The story starts out when Betty (RenÃ©e Zellweger) learns the man she was going to marry is really a mobster. Betty is so upset by this that she runs away from the city to Montana. While driving through the night, she is taken by a truck driver (Chris Rock) when he passes her car.|0
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy, were you? Well, you're just gonna have to take a chance that it's going to be there somewhere. When a movie's plot is simple enough to fit on the back of a cereal box it might not be a bad idea if the filmmakers put that information on a separate sheet and mailed it to you in the mail, just as a service. Some films are so full of themselves they make the audience feel ashamed for enjoying the spectacle.|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show and the cast! i've been watching episodes of it since i've moved to my new town and i just want to know when its going to start again !!! This is soooooooo coool! I just can't stand it, I always want to watch another episode but then I have to go to class and I don't have time to finish it. You really should put more of these up on your site. It's the coolest tv show ever.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just watch this show once you will never be able to forget this show . This sitcom should be shown on every channel in Britain and in every country in the world because this is one of those classic comedy shows that will always make you laugh when you watch it . I would give it ten out of ten . So watch this classic comedy on youtube if you have not already . You will be very very pleased that you did .|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , the inevitable sequel would arrive sooner or later. And, it has. With the release of a sequel to the highly-acclaimed 1981 psychological thriller of the same name, `` Friday the 13th '' Part 2 was released on March 9th, 1982. It follows Jason Voorhees' 13 year journey to murder teenage girls on the last day of their summer camp. And, of course, he doesn't fail. In the second installment, camp counselors are hired to replace the previous group who were slaughtered by Jason.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
"15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in England. The opening credits start with the following:
Narrator: (voice-over) The British have a word for this. They call it ""taking the mickey."" It means taking advantage of the stupid or helpless in a jokey or nasty way. The Irish have another term for it, ""screwing your friend."" If you've been ""taken"" by the British, you'll have to get your own back in some way. It's a tradition."|0
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. The story is about 4 guys that are trying to stop a crazy guy from killing people at a mall. I loved the story line but it wasn’t the greatest story ever told. The cast was really good. They had just the right amount of humor to make the movie very good and very fun to watch. I think that the people in the theater enjoyed it as much as I did, they were laughing out loud everywhere.|0
"I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went away from it in a state of ""discomfort"" because it left me asking a lot of ""why?"" and ""how come?"" questions that I did not have the answer to. As a consequence, I found myself thinking about it a lot and I guess the movie has stuck with me over the years. The first thing that always comes back to me about this movie are the opening sequences. They are quite disturbing."|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and action, and is so hard to put down once you have started. I think it would be really hard for a non fan to understand all the nuances. The characters are so very real and the situations that they find themselves in are typical of what a normal day would be like for so many people. But, this is no normal day or normal people. This is the beginning of a great new journey for our dearest friends, the Winchesters and their friends and foes.|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) ever appeared in, but it's one of my favorite movies ever made. I love the film for so many things: the fantastic cinematography, the acting, and the beautiful storytelling. I have a weakness for movies like this that look to the past for their inspiration and have a sense of style that goes beyond just a period setting. For those reasons, this is a movie I watch every year at least once.|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's accident . She would have been so pleased . One thing to note is that the director's mother was very upset with him for filming in the hospital and she never spoke to him again . They had a good relationship before he made the film and she was really supportive of it . A very nice documentary about a very nice man. This is about the life of an independent filmmaker who does it with such love and passion that you have to cheer on the guy and appreciate his work.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an adult magazine but it has a quality that is missing nowadays, the photographs are of a higher quality and they are shot in a professional setting. This magazine is definitely a piece of history. I like the fact that they use a mix of both amateur women and well known pornstars, and it makes it very easy to relate to the women. They use the same models a couple times, so it is nice to see women you recognize and can get to know.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in Europe. Follows the life of an international university student from the Philippines as he spends his ""Erasmus Year"" in Europe. International students tell their stories about Europe and the Erasmus period of their lives in the Erasmus Film Project. An International Student's Erasmus Journey is a story about life in Europe and Erasmus as told by international students. The story starts with a Filipino student and his family before his departure, and it shows how Erasmus helps international students develop a deeper understanding of Europe and its people."|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. I found it difficult to see the person that the media had portrayed. It’s interesting how celebrities can be portrayed differently to how they may actually be. There are celebrities out there that are portrayed negatively by the media which may be the complete opposite of them in real life. In the video we saw a few celebrities that had a good reputation but after seeing them on this video I can see where they get their reputation.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a very good thing. And I'm also thinking that I had better get a better knowledge of that subject. It will only help me as I get older. I've always felt the same way when I read or hear about how the British took the children from the Aboriginal people . I think that's so sad. I'm so glad we are finally seeing some justice done. Thank you so much Jan.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
"There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . The following is a list of some forgotten tittles that must be brought back to the big screen in DVD format. Some movies I would like to see released on DVD are:
“Holiday Affair” (1949)- This is my favorite holiday movie. It’s about a man who falls in love with a married woman. It’s set in NYC and is filmed in the winter time. I have seen this movie several times and always find it so touching and emotional."|0
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since Amazon Prime is showing it this weekend! It's hard to believe now but this film was originally made in 1979 and was banned for many years. It was released in the US in 1982 with about 200 seconds cut from it. It was re-released again in 2002 but this time with the original version. The reason why the film was banned in the UK in the first place was because it was too explicit and it was the first horror film with an unsimulated sex scene.|0
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time when this album was released. It is a great collection of songs about life ! I love the words on the lp sleeve, very clever . I've always liked the album cover . I would love to hear more from this artist . I hope he comes out with more albums in the near future . A must own album . I highly recommend purchasing this classic . You may like this album , you may not like it but either way , I think that you should give it a listen .|0
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand it's just about as good as it can get in a low-budget genre piece - but on the other there's some real flaws and issues that could have made it a lot better. There's really not a lot of plot here, it's basically just one scene repeated with different characters and situations. A group of friends go away on a remote camping trip, get lost, then find a mysterious old house. They then start to find out about the house, and the people who built it.|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
"I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was definitely a step up from my last exposure to the film in high school. I remember being disappointed then, and feeling vaguely offended, which is not something a movie should do at all. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on here that's worth discussing:
First and foremost, if you've never seen The Third Man, do so immediately. It is far, far better than its reputation, and has a lot of interesting themes that you can discuss at your leisure."|0
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice and the 2007 remake once . 1980's - I had heard rumours about it being cut , but hadn't seen any of it so I thought it wasn't that big a deal . Then one day it turned up on British TV - in the 87-minute version. I recorded it but never got round to seeing it. A couple of months later the remake was out and I was curious about the differences , so I ended up watching the remake as well as the 87-minute version - which I had on tape.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to deal with one another's peculiarities! Maria is in her early 30's, married to an older businessman and lives in a flat with her young son. She's got a close relation to her father's side of the family and loves spending time in her childhood house. Maria's parents are always there to help whenever she needs them. The family has always been rather close and it has helped her through some rather rough times in her life.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
"I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century, very well. Here’s the review from The New Yorker. A new documentary, ‘A Great Day in Harlem’, recalls the making of one of the great American photographic portraits
“Harlem 1958: Fifty Famous Photographers—Including the Master, Art Kane—Came to 125th Street to Take a Portrait of Jazz’s Fabulous ‘Brown Bomber’” (the cover story of the August 31, 1998, issue) is the most memorable issue of The New Yorker in my memory."|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the last 5 years, and I decided to read more about what was going on about this film, what it is about and what is the true story. In fact I read a few articles on the web about this case, and when I saw it, I had to go and watch it, because I was interested in everything that happened , the case and the movie, so I decided to watch it to compare it with the real case.|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this band is just amazing and it's very refreshing to hear how well the band plays together. All the instrumentalists in the band have their own style and they come together and form one cohesive sound. The band is just amazing and the best new band that I've seen since 30 Seconds To Mars. The band's sound has elements of U2, Muse, NIN, Linkin Park and more but it is so fresh and new that it's not just an imitation.|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? I wish that the Walt Disney Studio could have the same sort of magic as they did when Walt was alive but I know that I would never see that kind of quality movies from them ever again. It seems that they just want to make more money and that's all. It's so bad that there were so many great Disney Animated Features from 1995-2002 that it seems that nowadays the new ones just seem to be a let down compared to that greatness.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy! He made the show! What a fun show! The last 2 episodes of season 2 were my favorites and I really hope they do another season soon, it is very well written and the performances by the actors are stellar! I agree. His performance was wonderful. The show is fantastic. I just hope it comes back soon! It was good enough to have a third season? I guess we will never know but if so, we will see it sometime in 2019.|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago , and it made such an impact that it still stays with me. I never saw any movie like that then , and never saw anything like it after... I never thought I could watch it again without being disappointed.... But last week , while on holiday in Florida , my sister in law found the DVD in a shop in Clearwater , bought it , and sent it as a surprise to me. I was amazed that this old movie was still available !|0
"I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing, and it was in the movie section so we stopped and watched the trailer. My brother said ""I have been looking for this for years"" and went back to his own show. I couldn't believe it, the trailer looked so good that I decided to go to bed and watch the movie after I had slept for a few hours. I woke up and watched the movie. It was so good I watched the trailer over again."|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and i thought it was wonderful . I still think it was a very nice movie . The only thing I had a little problem with was the age difference between the actors . This movie is one of those movies that you could watch anytime for any reason . I’ve watched it only once when it first came out. I’ve not been a fan of romantic movies, but this one has been different. I love this movie!|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. It is a very funny movie. I think it is a perfect movie for me. I love it and will watch it again and again! In this movie are very special effects and I'm not only talking about the huge and funny animals that are part of this movie. The actors are good too and make a great performance. I don't think you will regret about seeing this movie. What a waste of time! A waste of time.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (one of the singers) telling a story about growing up in Gary, Indiana and living in a rough neighborhood. I think the title of this show was “Making the Band”. I have since moved from Chicago and I do not have access to PBS and I was wondering if someone could please send me a copy of the show. Thanks for your help. The title is “Making the Band” and it is the first episode of the second season.|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known author , who has himself been to Egypt many times and knows the Egyptians extremely well. As I had never seen a picture of a `Egyptian' it struck me that it might not be very flattering to Egypt. However it was a pleasant surprise to discover that this is the best likeness of an Egyptian that has ever been seen - at least in my opinion. It's a shame that some people regard it as a cartoon , for it is in fact extremely accurate.|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually pleasing. And the music was awesome! I'm glad it got a limited release because this is one of the films I'm glad I saw. The movie is so beautiful! It's such an interesting story and I enjoyed it so much. I definitely recommend you to watch this movie! I really like this movie so much, I could watch it every day! The acting is amazing, the plot is amazing and the director is amazing.|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort in the lead role of a young man who, after a life of crime , returns to the streets of Atlanta to help the police catch a killer . I'd love to know how many of the actors, who are from the same area that the story takes place in, got to see this film when it screened locally. I believe that if more films were made about black people by black people it would help bring about more positive changes in the perception of black culture by the outside world.|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I do know that it is not possible to live and work in the States and have the same level of salaries in your country . The cost of living in the USA is really high ! There are some people who really have money to live very well , but the majority of people have no money . A friend of mine from Argentina (where he has a lot of money ) is working in the USA for a low salary and for the only reason that he likes the job .|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody could do it better. My favorite film of all times the one that changed my life forever when I first saw in my life was The Philadelphia Story . That and A Star is Born made me realize that there is more to life and what a life it could be . George made me see that people were not what they seemed . The man was a god . I love every one of his films from 1939 until the end . He was the best .|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` The Cell '' sounds like a standard action picture . But once you actually watch the film , you realize you're watching something else entirely . The plot outline for `` The Cell '' is as follows:
Carol ( J. Lo ) is a therapist working with violent criminals . She is in the process of trying to break a particularly violent inmate named Carl . While trying to break Carl , Carol undergoes an experiment in which her mind is placed in a kind of computer-generated coma ."|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale about a man who has to be saved from the clutches of 'chess madness'. The film is in the public domain, and has been released in various versions. This one is based on a 16 mm print of the film. Aleksandr Faynzilovich Kokorekin is a man who has never learned to play chess. One day a man gives him some books on the game, and his interest soon turns to obsession, as he begins to lose his job and his marriage.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what people said about them , and , I can tell by just looking at the photos of them , they were really, really, really , beautifully , beautiful people , and , it is such a loss , and such a waste , and I can not help but think , it must've been all the stress , and strain , and pressure they were living under . I'm glad you enjoyed my article.|0
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast and great special effects . The story is about a secret military group that is tasked with protecting earth from aliens . This is the first time they have to deal with a situation that the government doesn't believe the threat is real . This movie is really exciting and I don't want to give away too much , but it involves a time loop and a lot of running for your life . It is really funny too . This is such a fun movie .|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started with Tobe Hooper’s Eaten Alive in 1977 , and was at its most popular between 1978 and 1982. The golden age of horror is the best to come out of America’s cinematic industry , but there are so many fantastic movies that were made during those 5 years . There are the usual slasher staples like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street , as well as a variety of cult films like The Hills Have Eyes , Halloween III , Maniac , and My Bloody Valentine .|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my taste, but hey..I'm a wimp...), this is nevertheless an original book, quite a good read, if you don't mind the graphic-ness of it all. The basic plot is simple enough, and I think it could have worked quite well without adding so many details...but I guess it makes the book longer and more entertaining that way, so no real complaints :).|0
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I've ever seen on film. Incredible stuff. So you think you can dance: I saw the audition in Liverpool and was so amazed to see the range of dance styles being shown that I ended up going to every single audition that I could until I saw them at the O2 in London. I have never seen so many talented dancers and I have never been so moved watching dance before. King Kong: The Special Edition DVD is the best DVD I've seen and the best movie I've seen.|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
"In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making the documentary and interviewing his father about his childhood , which was spent in Nazi Germany , as Hitler 's youth grew up during the rise of the Third Reich .

I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the cast is all good . The action is well staged . The ending is a little bit of a letdown but there's a lot here to like . A lot of action , a lot of character development and a good cast . Worth checking out if you like the genre . I watched this last night and was a little uncomfortable with the ending, but the rest of the movie was great, as I think most westerns usually are.|0
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Chris Pratt. You should be more concerned with the fact that you are sitting in a theatre full of people that you are now connected to because of the simple fact that you are all sitting together enjoying the same flick. You will laugh and cry and share in a collective catharsis that will change your entire outlook on the world. I will tell you right now, you will cry. I am not sure what the world has become but I am sure glad that I am old.|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I've really only seen 2 westerns with Clint Eastwood and they were both really good , so when I saw that Clint was in this movie I was all for checking it out. The movie is about John Reid (Josh Brolin) who travels to Mexico with his brother , to see his dead father's land . After they arrive John meets up with a gun fighter by the name of Cole , played by Dennis Quaid , and a Mexican girl , Josey played by Emily Browning .|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Artificial Magic versus Real Magic, a play about a shipwrecked group of men on a storm-lashed island ruled by a mysterious exiled wizard and his evil magical creatures. Or it can be interpreted in a very different light, wherein the play is about a group of people from the modern world transported to an island ruled by a witch who has the power of an evil spirit that she uses to gain control of the other characters in her world.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a couple of weeks ago. I`m glad I did for I was quite surprised to see how much the two works are identical. The reason for my surprise was because I remembered that there were many changes made during the shoot and in particular that the final scenes were very different. Apart from the obvious difference in casts I was interested in what other scenes had been altered, and after watching them back to back I found there were two key ones which had been changed: 1.|0
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing it , its not funny . Now on to South Park episode #1021 – Make love , Not war. I’m glad that the boys didn’t talk about this episode for a couple of days as I expected them to . In fact I was really surprised that this was the week’s topic when I saw the trailer . I really thought it was going to be more of what happened to the boys this week . What I got was a very funny episode.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Searchers -- films where John Wayne took on more difficult roles than he normally did in westerns, films that, in a way, made him look vulnerable. Yet, for all his efforts, he never really achieved an iconic role, as much as he did in some of his other westerns, as a gunfighter. The Man who shot Liberty Valance has some similarities with those films, but it stands apart from the others in a number of significant ways.|0
"During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the U. S. Army invaders. A 1995 remake of the classic W. C. Fields film from 1941. This film is based on a novel, 'Never Say Never Again'. The original was released as 'Thin Man'. (1988)
An American reporter and her photographer boyfriend become involved with a British spy trying to escape the Germans. An anthology film of 18 interconnected stories, with a running time of 90 minutes. They all relate in some way to the theme of love."|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a fan of his work at all, until I saw this movie, and I have seen every movie of his that I can get my hands on... I have tried to track down this movie for several years with no success. It was made by the same people who made ""Stroker Ace"" with Burt Reynolds. If anyone out there can find me a copy I would be extremely greatful, but if anyone out there has ever heard of where I can get this I would really love to hear it !"|0
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few who actually do ) are not watching the show as it should be watched . First you need to watch one episode in a row , not jumping between seasons . Second you need to watch at least season 2 in a row so you can get attached to the characters . The main character has changed over seasons and you will understand why . Third you need to watch the whole season in a row so you have a feeling about the plot .|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with a single one . You're right about one thing. This film IS different from what you'd expect. However I've watched this film 3 times already, and I like it each time. Yes, there's no mystery of who the culprit is, so if you're expecting a 'whodunit' film, forget about it. But I think the main reason you have to like this film, is because it is so different in so many other ways.|0
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the audiences present were expecting something like the first Iron Man. I knew that this movie was a prelude to that, but I still found that there were some things that were different, that didn't work, and that were unnecessary. The first thing that was noticeable was that this movie was much darker in colour scheme than Iron Man. The second, which I found interesting was the amount of CGI that was used in this film.|0
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series of movies or books until we have watched it or read it . We have finally warmed up to The Twilight Series. We read them and watched the first movie . We now watch the second one on Netflix and can't wait for the 3rd . The first movie has a special meaning to us , it was on the big screen the night our kids had their prom. Now we have a new tradition of watching a movie together while we cuddle with the grandbaby.|0
"( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie ( Jesse Eisenberg ), a shy bookworm in her class who has never had sex. Together, they explore and experiment their sexual desires and try to get rid of their inhibitions. ( My Reaction )
This movie was so wrong! I thought it was really funny and I was laughing out loud. But when the story line came along, it was weird. You can understand why some people would find it inappropriate, even I did. I'm not sure if it's for me."|0
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to action adventure to romantic romp and had a ton of great action sequences . I've got to say though I've seen better action films and if you're a fan of the genre it's probably worth a viewing but if you're looking for something to really thrill your senses I'd suggest a better movie . There were a lot of things that could have been better in the movie , and the script really needed some work but not terrible for what it is , it is what it is .|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, singing a beautiful duet. We hear them in unison, and when Karen starts to sing a lower harmony, the film fades away, and the next scene shows her on a tour bus, with a microphone, rehearsing. We are not shown Richard singing a high harmony, only that he isn’t there when his wife sings it. The rest of the world knew that the Carpenters were a duet, but Richard Carpenter has always said that, in reality, his wife was the principal singer.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way like this one. I saw it about two weeks ago and I could not get it out of my mind for days! The cinematography was stunning and I could not believe the beauty of this place and the life that is led there. If I'm honest I'm still reeling from the film. It was like watching a documentary with an edge of horror. It made me so conscious of where my food comes from. I have always been an animal rights campaigner, vegan for 4 years.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. It has become one of the movies in my collection that i will watch every now and then. I don't really understand all of the hate against it , I think people can watch movies and just not like them for whatever reasons
I never said that people could not dislike this movie, I am just confused as to why people would. I understand how some people can't get into it, but I can not see why people would dislike it."|0
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should replay it every other day until it’s off the air forever . It is my favorite Disney movie ever !!! And I think the song is amazing and I want it to be my life song . Awww, I love that movie too!!! That was one of my favorite Disney movies as a child! I miss it! I was 13 when that came out, and it was my favorite movie of that year! I loved everything about it, even the music.|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some time ago, and said, ""you know, we need a really good movie set in the jungle with lots of natives, tough-but-handsome white explorers, and big-titted white damsels. It must also have a love triangle, wherein the two most attractive women have a sexual fling with one white male, who is in turn pursued by the other woman. We'll make the explorer a British officer. And the love triangle is between an American woman, a British soldier, and a French explorer."""|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit , I love both Spaceballs and the Naked Gun Series ) . This movie is just a fun, and at times ridiculously funny film , and that's what I look for in the movies I watch. It's great to see so many classic comedy actors in this flick, as well as Gene Wilder. The story doesn't matter, the acting is great, and the laughs are even better. If you want a movie that will make you laugh and smile, check out The Producers now !!!|0
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and children , and his last record was a flop.

In the meantime, he finds out that his son is suffering from the same disease that his wife had.|0
"Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's because we went to war for the wrong reason. ""I don't have the answer,"" said former Gov. Tommy Thompson, one of five presidential candidates speaking Saturday to about 1,000 people at a town hall-style forum in a high school in Wausau, Wisconsin. ""I would go and sit down with these leaders in Iraq and make a deal with them to create a democracy."" I agree with Gov. Thompson that we can't just walk away."|0
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a lifetime but also influences him/her in someway . I happened to be in such a situation in the year 2000 , when the first X Men movie with Hugh Jackman hit theaters . I was already a huge X-Men fan , having read all the comic books , watched 2 series on Cartoon Network , and played every single X Men game on my PS1/PS2/PSP . So, you can imagine that the X Men fever was at its highest when the movie hit the silver screen.|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I was so happy to see this one and I love her in this role. I can`t wait for more films to come. I am a big FAN . I hope that more will be in the future. Sadly I only have the VHS version but I do hope a DVD release will follow. It`s a must have! I`ve only seen this on VHS so far. But I`ve heard that it is available on DVD.|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something new on the forum! Hope you and yours have a good day. Just wanted to say i have just seen the film and thought it was great, I hope you get to make a sequel and that you get a chance to show it at the Oscars. I would love to meet you guys when i come to London! Wishing you the very best for 2008 and look forward to seeing more great stuff! Thank you for making a terrific movie.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me, I don't remember it being this scary when it was originally made, but I don't know how old I would of been when I watched it for the first time or what my frame of mind would of been like so I can't tell you why it would of been scarier now than back in 83 when it was made, but it is a scary movie for sure and one of the scarier ones.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character, J.T., who works as an escort in Melbourne, Australia. The film is a black comedy and also a drama, exploring the intersections of art, sex work and money. It's an insightful look into the real life experiences of men and women engaged in sexual service. J.T's world is populated by a range of interesting characters, many of whom are clients, who all help J.T. understand the realities of the world of sexual escorts and the impact of his actions on his family.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it all make sense when the movie is over and that it has made sense all the time. That you have not been pulled out of the film to be in your living room and you have not noticed that the clock has read 8:40 when you got up from your chair. That is what happened to me last night. I sat and watched the 2009 French-Canadian film Incendies. I was completely engrossed and I felt I was in that world. The film was so real and so visually gorgeous.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in other countries. The film earned more than 10 million euros and 8.6 million admissions. The film is based on the comics by Joann Sfar and Frederic Berin. It is the first feature-length production of director Gilles Bourdos after a career as director for advertising and a documentary. After his first film with Romain Duris was a hit in the French cinema, Romain Duris has become a popular actor. He has recently appeared in The Beat That My Heart Skipped.|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Harry Carey Jr. ). After Sandy is injured in a fight, the Mormons let Travis stay at their farm while Sandy recuperates. Travis learns that the ranch is located near the Mexican border, where a gang of horse rustlers have been killing and robbing Mormons. Travis enlists his old friend Pecos ( Rodolfo Acosta ) for help to stop the thieves, and together they head into Mexico, determined to bring the rustlers to justice.|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc by the same director , and I liked it so I decided to watch this one as well. But it was really really good. Sadly, I just found out Bruce died in 2009, 35 years after the end of his career, and 10 years after this movie was made. It's so interesting to see how he grew up with the instruments and how they influenced the music that was played in those times (and still does).|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , and the producers don’t take much care about quality. I was therefore taken aback and pleasantly surprised when we watched “Pamana” last night, a movie produced here in Cebu, which is a heartwarming film about an estranged father-daughter relationship. This is a family drama film about a man trying to get the blessing of his daughter to finally see his grandchild. The daughter is the one who gave him all the pain in his life and the grandchild is the child of the man’s grandchild.|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The serial killer of this film is a maniac, a psychopath who kills on the streets at night. There is no motivation for the crimes committed by the killer. The victims are just ordinary people walking around the streets at night and no one really knows them. The police have been baffled by this maniac's actions. At the same time a psychopath is locked up in one of the cells in a psychiatric unit.|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life story and fiction, where a real life person is playing a dramaticised version of that persons life. If you can overlook the flaws of `` Two Hands '' then you will enjoy the ride. The cast is a delight to watch and there is a strong Australian flavour that is obvious to the viewer.It is a great ride that is well worth a trip. It is well acted but the script is weak in places. It is a story that will be remembered, even if the cast is overshadowed.|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. It will take you back to the old days of science fiction when it was a bit cheesey and a little bit gory. There is nothing special about the film that will really stick to your mind after seeing it. It is a fun film to watch while you have nothing better to do. The main characters of this film are pretty simple. A guy and girl who have been together a while but don’t really know anything about each other other then their name.|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year. When I saw it I saw why. It has a very dark tone and it has some really graphic scenes that could make you turn away. It is really messed up in a good way. I am going to warn you, this review contains some spoilers so read ahead if you would like to know some more about the film. Todd Haynes directed this movie. The first thing I have to say about this film is that it has beautiful shots.|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. When I watched the trailer, it seemed to look likea good movie, and I was looking forward to it so much. I was notdisappointed. The scenography, the acting is all excellent. However, Iwanted to be blown off my seat and I was simply not. The storyline is avery interesting one and well-developed in parts. However, I did not feelthrilled while watching. It seemed like a long wait for nothing in theend.|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the South African Police ( SAP ) is trying to convince Mpondo to turn against his friends in the Pan African Congress ( P A C ). Mpondo is a freedom fighter working for a better life for the people. The Pan Africanists are a political movement fighting for equal rights for the African people in a country run by the racist South African Police. This is the reality of the period of the 1950s, during the apartheid period.|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a musical. Woody Allen is one of my all-time favourite screenwriters. His films have been an inspiration to my own work, particularly in the sense that he has always done things his own way. His work is never predictable, and never easy. Allen has a unique way of writing for the cinema screen. When you sit down to watch one of his films, he wants you to be thinking about the movie long after you've switched it off.|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . I am 19, and have only been listening for 3 or 4 years. I got into it from my mother and father , who have been fans of Richard and Karen's music for as long as I have been alive. However, it's only been recently that I have become totally obsessed with the pair. There is nothing that I would not listen to from them, they truly are amazing vocalists and the music is so catchy.|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for its theme , or an appreciation for the music that underscores it , but I have to say that The Egyptian has become the most watched movie on my DVD collection over the years. While the movie follows the life of the famous Egyptian Queen Cleopatra from her childhood through her reign and eventual suicide it is the music score that really brings the film alive. It is full of lush, ethereal tones and melodies that give the story the mystic quality it demands.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it’s supposed to be. The guy really knows his shit. And I’m not just talking about music. That’s a given. Brewer knows a hell of a lot about a lot of things. That’s a fact. Brewer’s latest film, Footloose, opens this Friday in theatres everywhere, and if the early buzz from some of my colleagues in the biz is any indication, it will be one of the biggest hits of the fall.|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... but its fun . I really enjoyed this movie and recommend watching it with a friends. One thing you need to do is look up a few things because the movie is kinda nonsensical .... but that's why you watch it right ... you watch it and then look it up . The story of a man who gets the opportunity to see his life from the outside , and to be honest this is probably the best way to describe the movie .|0
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching it I felt like I was in a time machine . This really is a must see film. This is a true story of the prisoners who revolted in Attica, a New York state prison, on September 9, 1971, and the aftermath. I was a young teenager then and I have no memory of hearing about it, but apparently the national press coverage was extensive. The film does a super job of portraying both the conditions of the prison and the rebellion.|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the old, the good & the bad and everyone else that is! This is a very powerful and thought provoking film that has the power and the depth to change ones life. I have found my spiritual awakening after seeing this film and will follow it for the rest of my life. The message is loud and clear for those of you who have not heard it before! I hope this film gets the recognition that it deserves. A film not to be missed.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as one of the children. I think she might have been a slave. I never had a chance to watch it with her. I loved watching this movie when it came out. The special effects were excellent and I think it did a good job of keeping the viewer interested. This movie was filmed in 3-D, but I don't know if I could sit through it in 3-D. But it is worth seeing on DVD. It was a fun story, and a great look back at history.|0
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Netherlands itself. It is a dark comedy about a guy that tries to start his life over only to run into his old friend that he tries to run away from and has a new girlfriend. The story is great and funny. It has a dark sense of humor but it also has great acting. It also has a great soundtrack with some awesome songs. This is one of those movies that you're going to laugh and cry at the same time while you're watching it.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make inappropriate comments and lewd jokes I was always on guard, so to speak, when dealing with the opposite sex. When I first began to blog, it was not my intention to get involved with blogging relationships, but I soon discovered that in order to get the word out about my writing, I would be forced to engage with readers and fellow writers. To say the least, I’ve met some lovely women who have helped me to gain exposure and have shared my journey with me.|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired). This movie gives us insight into how the legendary musician really thinks and it's a lot darker than we might have imagined! This is not a typical bio-pic, It's about the journey of a complicated and brilliant man who lived a difficult life that was filled with many tragic losses. Randy Quaid gives a really fantastic performance as the legendary Country-western singer/songwriter. The rest of the cast is fantastic, too!|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being woken in the middle of the night by his secretary. He wants to know if there's anything important in the newspaper. The only item the secretary is able to find is a short item announcing the marriage of a woman with whom the producer was involved a couple of decades earlier. The woman was a burlesque dancer ( Betty Furness ), the producer was a millionaire Broadway producer with a reputation for being a bit of a womanizer.|0
"First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life I have watched one. (The other one was called ""Körkarlen"" by the way...). But that's not to say that I have nothing to say about ""As It Is in Heaven""...
For a start - I love the Swedish way of writing movies... They are not afraid to leave the audience hanging, with a little mystery, some questions left unsolved - and I love it!"|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that this would be the typical film you might expect from the Farrelly Brothers, and boy was I wrong. This movie was so out there that I don't think I laughed as hard at any other movie the whole time I was at the festival. Shannon Elizabeth, who I will always associate with ""American Pie"", does a great job of playing the girl who is a ""gold digger"" and the one you would not expect to do this."|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time. There is nothing remotely new about this show. It's essentially a rip-off of a few other anime and a few movies. Let's start with the fact that the characters are practically copies of Naruto, Shinn Asuka, Sasuke Uchiha, Rin from FMA, and a host of others. The setting is so cliche' that you've seen it all before. The plot is about a group of heroes going to another world where they have to fight monsters and other villains.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
"One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , no huge budgets ,just an all american story told in a simple way . This film is a great film to show your kids and it is definitely a great film for families to see . The performances are all excellent especially the three lead actors . The scenery ,music and action is wonderful . I would rate this one of the top films of the year . A great western . 10/10 Excellent and one of the great westerns
I love westerns, and I have watched this film many times over the decades."|0
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time. In the 60’s when race was an important issue, when it was still a taboo to live your life in an open way. I think what this movie captures is the struggle to be who you are, the internal conflict. The fact that a black man, in this day and age, was able to tell a story about race in America that resonated so deeply was a very important step for us as a country.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait for things to go up on-line ( I have dish ) or the good will of people like you who have it or want it . Thanks for taking your time to provide me with the download . My daughter is very much interested in it . Thanks again and have a great weekend . This is not the complete series. There is an extra episode called ""My Favorite Martian vs. the World"". It was a pilot for a short lived spinoff series."|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up the Down Staircase,'' telling of the tribulations of young black teachers in a one-room schoolhouse on the sea islands of the Carolinas. The story of his experiences at Beaufort High in the early 1960s has become a bestseller, thanks in part to a star-making appearance on Johnny Carson's talk show and the fact that it was released just as the school year was starting. Mr. Conroy arrived in the Beaufort schools in the summer of 1964 to replace an 84-year-old principal.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, the issue could be trite and sensationalized . Not here . In fact, we get a subtle, yet intense, examination of what abuse does to the abuser , the victim, and the survivor . As a whole, it's as much about relationships as it is about surviving abuse . In other words, `` Jaded '' is as much a study of a family on the edge as it is an examination of the emotions behind the issue of abuse and recovery .|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate . If you have a heart you will enjoy it. It is long but you wont get bored you have to watch to the very end you will be glad you did . My mother bought the movie to me when I was 18. It's been 30 years since I have watched this movie and I still remember it like yesterday. It is one of the best love stories ever! I cried so much when I watched it and still does now, it is such a wonderful movie.|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager . it was the first film to be given an ‘A’ certificate and was directed by Ken Hughes , who later gave us the 1969 version of The Italian Job . The film was based on the novel, The Dock Brief, by Cy Endfield, who also wrote the screenplay and co-directed. The film tells the story of an aging criminal barrister named Frank Farr (Richard Attenborough) , a widower whose life revolves around the legal system.|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this film that made me enjoy it ... so much so , I'm now considering buying the blu ray version ... which is an absolute rarity for me as i normally loathe such films. The movie is a light romance / comedy ... and yes , it has the same feel as Pretty Woman ... which is why it's a good choice for this genre as it sets the right tone ... but it has enough differences to be its own film .|0
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood teacher’s voice, the subject matter of WWI is difficult to comprehend in all of its depth and breadth. There is just too much information and it takes a lot of work for a high school student to uncover the complexities of such an important time in history. In addition, it is challenging to develop a personal connection to the topic. We are lucky if we can identify a grandparent who lived during WWII, but rarely have a grandparent who lived through WWI.|0
"My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we loved it
It is a good family film. I love this movie. It's about a family that lives in a big home and the oldest boy, Michael, doesn't get along with his parents and his younger brother. They have a lot of problems with him and he does some things wrong, but when he was a kid, he was a genius. He is so smart that he can speak different languages, and his brother, Anthony, is just the opposite."|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and a very good movie to watch.This movie have the best soundtrack I ever hear.I recommend you to watch this movie because I am very sure that you will like it and have a great time!!!!! I think that this movie can be an Oscar Nominee because I think that there is nothing that this movie didn’t do.I hope that you like it! This movie is a very interesting movie I like it and I think you will too.|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, there's the satisfaction in seeing a short with a different approach than what's normally seen. The visuals are fresh and imaginative. Then there's the sadness of knowing that there aren't more like this . The story of Boy-Next-Door feels like the work of a mature filmmaker who has a unique vision and can bring it to the screen, but doesn't have the financial backing to produce a full feature.|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe it isn't so simple, after all, to try to explain the meaning and significance behind a film like Fata Morgana. The film itself is a visual experience. I will try to give an idea, though it will be difficult and I'm sure I'll fail miserably, but what the hey . . . Basically the film is about a man named Peter who is on holiday with his wife and children in southern France, at a beach, near the Pyrenees mountain range.|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you have ever worked in an office full of middle managers you'll have experienced much of the humour in this movie. If you have worked with people with Aspergers Syndrome then you'll know that they can be highly functional and very creative. In this case it is the highly functional but creative employee who is on the way out and the office full of mediocre managers who stay! It is actually quite a funny film especially if you are able to identify yourself in the characters and situations.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who invents a remote control machine that lets him control any animal on earth. The problem is, the machine can be used by other bad guys to create havoc around the globe. Of course, the bad guys get the remote control machine. Now the hero must go around the world trying to retrieve the remote control machine. This film has some great special effects, but also a good story line and acting. The hero of this film is very believable.|0
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! ! ! ! ! i hope i will see them on tour soon ! ! ! ! i liked it sooooo much ! it was the best movie ever! I just watched the new movie and really enjoyed it but I must admit that I can not understand what the guys are saying when they are speaking French. Is it possible to get the dialogue with English subtitles to play on my computer? I am a big fan, and the movie was amazing!|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (besides having us ) was buy tickets to see this film . We are 50 years old now so we have seen our share of films but this was the very best. I went to a midnight showing last weekend in a packed house. I had never read the book before, but I loved the film. It was a bit slow in the beginning. I'm not sure how much people were getting into the film by the time the little girl appeared, but we were definitely into it by then.|0
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it or not. The first part of the film was interesting to me mainly because I’m a big fan of the concept of a parallel universe. But after about 35 minutes I started to become impatient waiting for some kind of plot to unfold. I kept expecting things to happen, but I was wrong. The entire movie was nothing more than just an elaborate setup for a really big payoff at the end of the film.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , sheep farmers, cowboys or some outback kangaroo wrestling. If you were lucky they would have an Aboriginal as an extra, and you would see lots of sheep or kangaroos. In fact there weren’t many films made at the time. The early silent films of the 1910s and 20s, the ‘Talkies’ of the 1930s, and the few post WWII films of the 50s. As well as Australian films, there was the odd American film that would be re-made in Australia.|0
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the best. Blood Cult is a tale of a small town in the 1930s that has been haunted by the vengeful spirit of a Native American. The movie starts with an Indian burial ceremony that goes a little wrong and starts a curse that is passed down though generations. Now in the eighties the town has a cult who are practicing black magic and ritual killings. And it's up to the police to stop it.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, and it's hard to look back at a show that followed Seinfeld and compare it. As for the episode in question: I'm a guy, but I've read the review and it sounds like a great episode. It's so refreshing to hear a female character being the lead in an episode that doesn't have her pining for a man, or obsessed with her physical appearance. As for a female lead in a show that I'm actually watching: The Office has Pam!|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory and with a lot of twisted ideas that will keep you thinking . I liked it very much and I have watched it more than three times already . The two twin sisters who are very different from each other , one is pretty and one is kind of ugly so they are rejected by the circus and they end up working for it . But things get really bad for both of them and they start fighting for their lives against the evil circus director .|0
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The firm is trying to keep a large company safe. Brian is trying to impress his boss. Brian is also working under cover to protect the boss’s daughter, Lisa. Lisa is having a hard time because her father believes that she is going to bring the wrong type of guy into his home. The plot of this movie revolves around a very rich man trying to find his long lost wife. His wife left him, and he has not spoken to her since.|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors like Spike Jonze, I felt like I was watching a movie in 3D. In fact I've never seen so much vivid detail in a movie. To begin, the cast is outstanding. The actors are very charismatic and it seemed as if every scene was staged for the purpose of being a movie frame. I know it's a little strange to think like that. I guess I'll be a little more specific.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute short (about 10 minutes) about a group of dogs that work in a factory. Every night at the same time (a la Rocky Horror), a gang of wolves come and attack them and take out one at a time. The only thing they can't do is bite the wolves back, so they devise clever ways to do so. I liked this short for its creativity and simplicity. The next two I watched during the festival were about dogs, and I'm getting tired of dogs.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It is an excellent movie , even better than the book , which is also wonderful . I loved both book and film. It's the best documentary made. It shows the true human side of these two women and their courageous stories. The film gives hope to many people going through similar situations as the two women. I saw this movie in a film class, it is very moving. This is an excellent film. This is an excellent portrayal of the lives of two women.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point for African American history and a movie that should be in every Black home. It also is a movie that is so important to African American filmmakers because this film opened the door to many African American films to follow. It is a shame that there are so few films dealing with racism today. This is a film that needs a remake! The movie revolves around a group of friends who happen to live in a very prejudice neighborhood in 1973.|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. Sometimes I will watch a trailer that I think will be a horrible movie and will not even watch the movie once it hits the big screens. This is how it happened with the first Hunger Games film. It wasn’t even on my radar until the day it hit the screens. The same thing happened to The Avengers ( I never planned on going to see it) and The Dark Knight.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in the rain, then another on a dark night with a broken airplane and finally a flight in fog. The first flight ended in a crash. On the second he was able to get the plane up and then had to go down to a field to land. On the third flight the plane crashes into some hills. In the fog, Jim takes his passengers to a small town to land the plane. The people think it is a monster, especially when Jim flies the airplane around the city.|0
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in this sequence is Dilbert , who is shown here in his normal work clothes . He’s at home, and he wants to make himself a snack , but he doesn’t want to be disturbed by the noise that goes on in the office . So he gets his snack, sits in his living room and puts on his headphones , to drown out the sounds coming in from the office . But we know that he’s not really listening to anything in his headphones .|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some movies on Netflix and decided to give it a chance. It's one of those movies that I never heard about but I really liked it. If you don't care for gore, this movie isn't really for you. Lots of bloody action, gory kills. I love this kind of movie. The characters are superb. The story was really engaging. If you haven't watched it yet you should definitely give this movie a chance ! I would watch it again !|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked ass. It's worth watching this movie to see all that. Apart from that , this movie's basically a bunch of paintings set to music. Some paintings were more moving than others , and the ones that were more moving usually had the music that matched. I found it very touching to hear The Cure's Disintegration played in the background, for instance, and the painting that accompanied it looked like a dream. The paintings are all done by the great artist Timothy Hutchins.|0
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is not afraid to show us a new story and new characters, but it 's really good. I have to say that I have a great time when I 'm watching this show but I have to say one thing that sometimes in the last episodes is really sad.And that 's all I 'm going to say ,because I 'm afraid that if I say something more ,I could spoiler something for you . And I don't want that .So watch this show and see it yourself .|0
"When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his specialty of the moment; I for mine. We would spend a good deal of time going from one to the next looking at all that the others had in stock. We also would talk about themes that we had discussed before and would share our ideas. We would always compare prices, but more often we would share our favorites. After we married we would go together to the more ""advanced"" bookstores as we could afford them."|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite and best-known Westerns. This film was made in 1952 and starred Ford , Ward Bond , Linda Darnell and Ben Johnson. The story follows a wagon train heading towards the California gold rush in 1845. They are headed by an elderly Mormon patriarch (Johnson), with a new recruit, Bill (Ford) a bounty hunter who joined the party to bring back the last of his outlaw brothers in order to collect the reward.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a DVD of this movie. It was soooo ahead of its time, and so much fun to watch. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by all age groups and for me it was just a wonderful experience. I still watch it on VHS but I wish so much it was available for purchase, as I'm sure there are many people who would buy the DVD version. I'd love to see it on DVD so much. Please release this soon!!|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up this film to the director’s desire to work outside the mainstream, as well as his desire to create a surreal world in the form of a film. The film is an interpretation of a book called The Necronomicon, a work attributed to H P Lovecraft, a prominent American fantasy writer of the 1920s. The film, as well as the book, explores themes of science, metaphysics and the supernatural. The title means ‘Foreboding Apparition’, and this is certainly an apt description.|0
"I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later became a Video game on XBOX live. I also played in the cult TV show `Screwballs ' , and have had an acting career spanning 34 years and still going strong. Dead Rail the Movie
The film Dead Rail is an action thriller which is set in Scotland in 1947 , starring David Warner and David Soul. The film is available on DVD . I was cast as the role of Sam in this movie and went on to play many roles after that in many other films, TV shows and commercials."|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair witch film. I like the use of flashlight . It 's a lot better than the typical found footage flick and it has some good scare scenes . This is the kind of film I would watch at a sleepover with a bunch of friends when you were 13. It 's not overly complicated and it 's not scary. It 's fun and entertaining, just not scary enough . I think this is one of those films that you can't judge unless you sit through it in one sitting .|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am now 45 years of age and have only seen it once , so when I saw it was on a DVD , I decided I had better buy it as I may not see it again for a long time , so I ordered one from Australia . A great movie with a wonderful cast and wonderful music . Very funny too. I would definately buy it on DVD. This movie is great. I got to see it in the theatres and I have watched it on video about 3 times already.|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I've seen this show from when it came out so I have to say it hasn't changed. I love the story lines, all the actors have done a great job, they all seem really close as a cast. They also seem like they get along really great off screen too. The only thing I have to comment on is the way the story lines have gone over the last couple seasons . I really like how the show has a lot of funny episodes , but some are very serious.|0
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and Taron egerton should have an Oscar nomination . If you haven't seen this already, it is a good movie and the actors are great in it. I'd recommend it for all the family, but I'd watch it first before you let your kids watch it. Great movie! One of the best I’ve seen! Wonderful movie!! The cast is amazing! The actors do such an incredible job! Robin Hood has been my favorite folk hero for a long time.|0

However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe we know how important this kind of movies are. I think every country should have a Oscar movie like this! I’m so happy that they won an Oscar! It’s great that they can show how it is to live with disabilities and show the diversity of people! And the acting of the three leads is really impressive, I can’t take my eyes off the screen when they are acting. Such a great storyline. The three leads are phenomenal.|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  which, as you know, is about a teenage girl who is murdered, and who comes back from the dead as a revenant or zombie to exact revenge on her killer and his accomplices  you automatically imagine that the film will fall into one or another of the usual traps that have long been associated with this subject-matter: namely, it will either be exploitative and cheap  like The Burning, which also starred Jason Patrick Lewis  or else self-important and heavy-handed like The Crow, with its pseudo-literary pretensions.|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a genius but to a world we could all live in. I have to give this book a four star rating only because there were parts where I lost focus or got confused, not because it lacked creativity and intellect. I'll have to read it again to gain a fuller understanding of what is going on in this book. But it's a very entertaining story that leaves the mind dazed and full of thought.|0
"for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a soul knows of it
I have seen the movie in the late 80's and liked it but it is difficult to find a copy anywhere. I just found this site by accident while searching for a copy of the movie. Teddy Bear January 16, 2013 at 6:44 PM
I recently found a video copy on Ebay, but it has been pulled. If anyone wants to buy a VHS tape I have one that I could sell for the original cover price, which is $40."|0
"Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of the film medium with an unsurpassed body of work that includes documentaries, narrative features, and hybrid films such as the epic "" Fitzcarraldo"" and "" Rescue Dawn"" , Herzog's newest film is no different. In his quest to make a film of uncompromising quality and intensity, Herzog has once again brought together a cast of world class actors in the hope of making a modern day film noir that is as intense and memorable as the great films of old."|0
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . There is just something about the whole idea of the ""old wild west"" that fascinates me . I've always loved to read about the way the west looked . I 've read some western fiction and non fiction and I just can't put them down . I think I 've only seen a few western movies . I can't say I really enjoyed any , but I do want to see some more . I think the ones I've seen that I enjoyed the most are Tombstone , and Dances With Wolves ."|0
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for me the best of everything is a book by Louis Auchincloss. It has 61 short stories. I love the fact that the stories are based on true events that really did happen. You never know who the character will be and what they will get themselves into. In the beginning, you may not like one of the people in it but then the next day you will come back to it and think about who that person is. I love it.|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . So, we're being more Blue? I just think that's silly. Being Blue isn't a lifestyle choice. Blue isn't the answer to the question. Blue doesn't make any sense. And I'm a big Blue person. I get it! But it's just a silly idea. And it's not like I'm a red person now, so it's not like I just turned into a completely different personality.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . The photography was excellent with some amazing sequences of the different species in the ocean.The Bad : This was a documentary, so it is not going to appeal to everyone in the same way a narrative film will . I also felt like the story could have been more focused and developed instead of just giving us information in a scattered way .I also thought the movie was a bit long in some parts with the information it gave us on the different species of sea creatures .|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which the hero and his friends are at the local bar and the local drunkard says: ” I was the 23rd man that you shot at in the war, I am the 10th you have killed this time ” …. In the second movie there is an addition to this scene: ” I am the second you have killed in this war”. It seems that the movie maker thought that it is not enough to make it clear that the guy has had some previous experience in war.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice chick turns into an evil seductive bitchy demon . It has almost the same plot as Hell Girl but it has a slightly different way of getting it all started . Basically a demon is trying to collect souls but a young witch gets in his way . After that we get an interesting twist but I will let you see the movie and find out for yourselves . One thing I will say though is that it's much better then I originally thought it was going to be .|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , meaningless and misleading title that is! ) I never saw it in cinemas but have seen it on Tv many times , and bought the VHS many times too! I know I was a kid but i loved it, the story was so moving and I always wanted my family to have a big get together like this one too! I know that is not realistic, but it was always a dream! There is not a scene that is not beautiful, well acted, funny, or dramatic.|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead?'' `` Like who? '' `` A dead person. `` I don 't know, I play lots of different things, can't I? '' `` I mean can you fake it? `` Yes, I can, but I don't know if I have the strength to fake it with you, '' said the girl , and the guy took her hand in his and they went out of the studio .|0
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine in this drama. I can not understand why so few people have seen this movie, but if you ever get a chance, it is worth your time, especially if you are a fan of these actresses and their careers in general! If you liked this movie you may like the one with Jackie as the same character called “Jackie Brown” and Candice plays a minor role in that one also.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not have a clue as to how much it would affect me . As the movie began , I was very much entertained by the characters & the story . It was a story that had so many twists & turns . I was captivated by the acting of the cast , I was very impressed by the acting of the entire cast . They really played each role to its fullest & never let you down . The story was so different , yet it was one I could relate to & understand .|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply the icing on the cake! I am so happy to have been there and to have witnessed the amazement on the faces of all those who came to the show as I did (I was there in the front rows) it was absolutely fantastic! As you can see from the pics, Geddy Lee was wearing a nice shirt on which you could clearly read `` 48 years and 250 million albums later, I finally get it '' I believe Geddy Lee said those words when he saw how much people loved him.|0
"I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the lack of chemistry between Lily James and Sam Riley which I have to agree on. I can't say I felt a real passionate connection between them at all - they seemed more like a pair of siblings. Lily James played her role very well though - it's just that it wasn't at all what I would call ""great acting"" or ""charismatic acting"" which would have helped the movie. In my humble opinion, the chemistry seemed forced and awkward to watch."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my daughter I gave in and went along with her. Well it was worth the money spent. This is a well crafted film based on a true event. The protagonist of this story is an 89 year old man .He is suffering from Dementia and cannot recognise his own son who visits him at the nursing home he is staying. He has a memory gap and cannot relate the past or the present. In short he cannot remember his own son.|0
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by the Mafia in cold blood, she is left with only one option - to assume her husband's identity and return home in an attempt to take down those responsible. But Del's ruthless boss Mr. Fontaine ( Clifton Collins Jr. ) is a step ahead of her and Del's shifty partner Mr. Petosa ( Michael Rispoli ) won't take kindly to an outsider stepping in on their territory. As Del's body count rises and the heat rises, Betty discovers that to survive the lies she must become the lie.|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the movie is the story of three boys who come home to find their girlfriends in bed with each other . After the boys get over a shock , they hatch a plan to teach the girls a lesson . But what begins as a joke quickly becomes something much, much bigger . `` Boy Next Door '' has a very simple idea at the heart of it . That is why the movie is so successful . The movie has no fat , no unnecessary subplots or characters .|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) which I watched today. The movie is based in a small town of West Bengal and tells the story of 11 year old Ashima played by Lalita Behera and the events that happens around her after her mother's death in an ashram and her uncle's sudden appearance to take her back home with him to Mumbai . It is a very different film with a very different treatment of the subject matter. Sen does a fantastic job as a director .|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Gap' .. as there is a gap in the hills .. Wonderful images, I can see why they're so special. It's hard to imagine them in a gap! I can't believe you found them too!! They are just fabulous!!! How fabulous to find your photographs! Great photos! And what an amazing story! Great story behind the images! Oh wow, so glad they were found. Wow - what a great story and what a find!!|0
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes my 4th of July weekend .... was FUN !!!! My weekend started early on the 4th. My good friend Diane and I went over to her house , and while she was getting some of the food ready I took a little break and went for a little walk around her block. While out there I found a little something I was looking for ... I know what you're thinking . Yep ... there's a dead body in my bushes.|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season is starting i love them all so much and im going to miss them all , i can really relate to the shows and the actors , and its a good show for girls , i love to see all their fashion and outfits , the girls are so cute , i hope that the new season turns out to be good and i really want to see more and more seasons of the show . I love love this show .|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most slasher/gore films just aren’t that interesting so this film was a welcome change . There’s plenty of deaths and plenty of blood and guts . The filmmakers knew what they were doing to make this kind of film . Most of the acting is pretty good . I like the film’s gore and I was surprised that most of the kills are pretty original . I really enjoyed the main characters and they are all well acted .|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines its many elements. There are two parallel stories, and they both succeed, and while it’s never quite explained why they are connected, it’s easy enough to get into the film because of the strength of both of the two stories and the actors who are portraying. Jason Clarke is Eric, an Australian who is on his last chance in a small town in South Australia, and this is his last job before he’s supposed to get on a boat and move back to Sydney.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in a lot of areas , one thing it does do is show how hard it was for her to succeed and how hard it was for her to get where she was . She was a talented singer and a beautiful woman but her self image was very negative which made it hard to be a success in the world of entertainment . The movie starts out with Karen Carpenter talking to her husband in the studio in which they record in.|0
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the great creative surges in the history of the medium. When I was a teenager in the early 60s there was not much on television for kids and Avery's cartoons were a staple of Sunday afternoons. MGM was one of the few studios in those days that regularly released a cartoon on Saturday night as well as Sunday afternoon. There was no such thing as a weekend cartoon block on TV in the early sixties so kids of the time could watch the Averys whenever they wanted.|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surfacey characters and a somewhat predictable plot line. The tunes though, are what makes it worth watching over and over, especially since there are three different styles, from folk to pop to rock, and all of it very catchy and memorable, though some of it, especially the folk style, does get annoying after a while (though I admit it's still catchy even after several listens - which is why I bought the cd).|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have a single speaking character , even if at the end of the credits it announces the presence of a woman's voice in an interview . The only soundtrack is the voice of the German director who recounts a strange experience he had a few months ago in a remote area of Patagonia , in Argentina , when he was hiking and camping in the area with a local guide . The film is a meditation on reality and how we perceive it .|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in the series . Graphics are beautiful, story is great , game play is unique and challenging . Very fun game with a great story ! It's not the best game on iphone, but its not the worst. I wish they would fix the issues so I can give this a 5 star review. Over all the graphics are good and the story line is interesting, but I'm on level 12 and the game will only give me one hour per day.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for the TV sitcom's of the mid-1950's, including Father Knows Best, I Love Lucy, and Make Room for Daddy (aka 'The Danny Thomas Show' ) and the films were the most popular series at M-G-M studios when the studio was at it's box office zenith in the 1950's. The films, as well as the characters and cast, were controversial in many ways, and certainly not politically correct.|0
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and Ashley. There are 3 shows a day. The only problem is that its very hard to find out whats going to be performed. There is a brochure, and Id advise you to bring it with you if you are planning a visit. You may also visit their website for a full listing. This page contains a single entry by Mark published on August 20, 2006 10:28 AM. Bring Your Children to the Circus and Teach Them How to Prepare for a Hurricane was the previous entry in this blog.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more about the people behind the music and show than anything else. It made me a big fan of The Band Perry. A great documentary on the music and people behind this country music group. I highly recommend it. It also has music videos. It's a documentary about the making of 10 tracks from the album Pioneer. It was very interesting. A fascinating behind the scenes documentary about a country super group of the 80's. Well done and worth the price.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren always does a great job and this season is no exception . It is so good that you will not be able to turn it off . This show is really good and I would recommend this for any age group. The actors do a great job and they all look very good. You will enjoy the show so much you won’t be able to turn it off. The actors do such a good job you will get so caught up with the story you will forget you are watching a drama.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I didn't really think about it much though until it was out on DVD. The movie itself is pretty cool. I have never been to Japan so seeing how the place looks in this movie made it seem like a very interesting place to go. The city was awesome and I really enjoyed that aspect of the movie. The storyline though, was a bit strange. The storyline involves a guy that gets fired from his job at the bank.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must lead if he can't enjoy this gem of a movie. It's one of the most enjoyable, clever, and well done movies I've seen in many a year and I will watch it again. It's a shame that there are only 5 reviews of this great movie (as of 12/07/06). I have watched ""Hitch"" several times and it has always been funny, intelligent and engaging. Will Smith is excellent in this role."|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally re-ordered them . In so doing he has altered the text to a degree. The original story is told in the third person but the film version is in the first person narration of one character in a group , Oscar Wilde . In doing so the writer has created a one-sided impression of events . Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest was written in 1895 . It is set in Victorian England . It is comic but with a serious undertone and is often referred to as a comedy of manners .|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant talk of how well it was done. It has all the elements of a good story: some great characters, a great setting, interesting themes, a good amount of action, lots of funny scenes, a nice bit of sadness and of course the good guy who saves the day. But somehow it does not all add up to make a really good movie. It feels like there are two different films mixed up in it.|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical release with original ending. I'm glad I ordered before they took it down. I really enjoyed this movie and hope to watch the DVD soon with my wife and kids. So I just wanted to thank you for making it available and for your excellent customer service. Hey I just got mine in the mail today as well. I watched it tonight and it was amazing! The ending is as I have been told by other people.|0
Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of ``The Incredibles '' . The plot is all there . And if you can't follow it , you are probably as dumb as a box of hammers . If you get it , you know you've seen it all before . But that's OK , that's what makes it so good . This movie's style is the story , itself , and I'm sure we can all appreciate just how much work goes into something like that .|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , I 'll be honest , in 3 years or so!) . There were some excellent camera angles and I could hear every word spoken on screen. However , as soon as the story took over , the camera work took a back seat and in the end the photography was not used well at all. Some of the angles and shots were not used at all . As for the story it was not what I expected after that brilliant opening.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors and moves into the realm of thriller with Nurse Betty. It is a witty film that moves at a steady pace. There are many dark moments but the comedy keeps it in good hands. It is a film that could have gone the way of The Truth About Cats & Dogs and gotten very silly but it does not. It is much better because of this. The acting is great. Morgan Freeman and Greg Kinnear stand out as the two evil cops.|0
"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and it has stayed in my memory banks for so long....I remember my mother and aunts telling it to us....I think they probably got the book from the Library...... If you remember this....well I think it's from the early 1950's......do you know the cartoonist and the title of the cartoon? Sorry it's so small, but it is the only photo I have...... It looks like ""The Golden Age"" series of books."|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. I used to live in the East End of London and worked in the docks , and I've known all the characters involved , and been in the pubs , where they'll meet for the first time for 10 years or so. Brought back memories. But it's not just a personal film , but a history lesson for anyone who knows London , and of course there are the characters and their stories, that made the book such a classic.|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Sahara desert, is an astonishing and moving cinematic experience. Herzog, who has been called “the cinematic godfather of the new documentary,” has a unique way of shooting his documentaries. As he himself has said he prefers “fictionalizing documentary” where he shoots his films like fictional features with actors. This gives him more creative control of his documentary shoots and also allows him to capture the essence and emotion of the subjects and stories he’s telling in his films.|0
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died a few days ago . I'll miss her very much . Lovely Anicée, and very talented. What a shame that such a beautiful person had to die. RIP! I've seen her in 1998, when I lived in Brussels. She was living in Belgium. I was so happy. I was not her biggest fan, but the last time I was a fan and I was happy to see her, I was a big fan.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award season, it is funny and has many laughs in the episodes I have seen. It is a funny show with some laughs. My favorite part is that the main characters are very well acted, and not over the top. The show is set in NY, and has a good feel to the set. I love that the characters are very relatable to most people. I would love for people to check out the show and see what they think.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how good a film is made with a low budget. This is the debut of director Andrés Baiz, a young man in his twenties, who wrote, produced and directed this masterpiece. The film is the story of Andrés, the lead character, who is the son of a man that has spent many years in prison for drug possession and distribution. Andrés is a teenager and spends all his time with friends on the street. One day, he is arrested for stealing a motorcycle.|0
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it more than once to catch what you missed , it will make a lot more sense to you . This is a good movie and the ending is awesome . If you love sci-fi , you will not miss this movie. In the not-too-distant future, a man is sent to investigate and solve a murder on a distant planet. Upon landing, his mission is suddenly complicated by the discovery of a second alien life form.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another stupid reality show and never watched it. I have been thinking about getting it because I have been hearing about it from a few people and then I see it and it looks kind of interesting but I didn’t buy it until today. Well, I am so glad that I got it. This show is so great. It really makes you see what is important and how to live life. It is so amazing to see these people come together.|0
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in the 60's, a very intelligent young scientist decides to create his own universe in his head, where he will be able to create his dreams. The dreams that come to mind have to do with women. The film is extremely funny in parts and at the same time extremely intelligent. This film is worth every penny of your time and you'll be able to relate to it. It's a must see and a must buy. Buy it!|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , around the time of the film’s initial release in 1996 . I guess I was 15 or so . So, the film is older than me . I think we all know what this film is about . We know it is about a group of people trapped on an elevator . We know the premise, and we know what will happen . So, why watch this film again? I am going to keep this brief . I will say that the acting is very good .|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the detective story. Although it had existed in the form of a subgenre in the late 19th and early 20th century (Dostoyevsky, Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton) it is the work of authors like Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh which really put the genre on the map and gave it the respect it deserved. They also made the form very popular, to the point that, in the United States, there was a great deal of imitation.|0
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time I watch, I see something I never saw before. I also like the cameos , like John Belushi and Leslie Nielson. This movie is a true classic and should never be missed, especially by the young ones . It is so funny, one of my all-time favorites ! It has been said that most of the funny scenes in the movie were not in the original script, but just improvisation in the movie itself. I would not doubt that.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What is great about Duke in these films is the fact he never has any lines , it is only him and his horse . He would ride along and do what needed to get done , he did not talk . He would talk to the animals , the Indians or anyone else . It is easy to sit and watch a movie and laugh at him , but if you really pay attention he is a great role model on how a man should act and do things .|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . I am 77 years young and am delighted that it is still available to be re-viewed in 2009. I have since bought a DVD of it for my collection. I remember that there was much debate about it and whether it was suitable for children at the time it was first released in 1952. It has stood the test of time and I am very glad that it still continues to attract a new generation of viewers.|0
"There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is among them. There is nothing like walking across that stage to receive your diploma. There is no one who knows what it feels like to get that diploma than the family members who watched you grow and mature to the person who is about to walk out onto that stage and accept that diploma. Family members, friends, and fellow students all share this experience and the pride of being a graduate. In a world filled with ""What's next?"|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know that can make you feel sick when you view it with your eyes . This is one of the few movies that has ever left me feeling sick and nauseated and I think it's all due to the way they shot it and the way it was presented to us. The movie is the story of two sisters and their horrible family that they lived in. The father and mother were always at each other's throats because of the father's job.|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . It seems like there were only a few films under that label that had any real quality . This one is a good watch but not something I’d go out to see. It has a fairly simple story and the acting is not that great but I think the camera work really saved it from being just another movie. I’d have to say it’s worth seeing. It’s a bit slow in the first few minutes but gets into the meat of the story fairly quickly .|0
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which originally aired on NBC in four two-hour episodes on January 26, 27, 28, and 29 1985. It is a remake of the classic Civil War film `` Gone with the Wind '' by the same name, which was made 40 years prior. The remake starred Patrick Swayze , who had won the lead role by giving a convincing performance of the book's main character, Ashley Wilkes , in an audition tape.|0
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The 70-minute program is set in 1850, and features a handsome cast, including Lon Chaney , Jr. , Ronald Reagan , John Ireland , Lee Van Cleef and others . This episode is also famous as the very first `` TV-Movie '' ever broadcast and as the pilot to one of the all-time great western series on TV , starring Chuck Connors . In this first season opener, two brothers are forced to fight to protect the family ranch.|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But he doesn't want to hunt, and he's in for a world of trouble because he's in the one place on Earth a rabbit can't outrun a hunter. Bugs Bunny shows up on the scene, and, while he tries to convince Daffy to stop hunting in favor of taking up the easier sport of duck hunting, Daffy can't be deterred until the end of the cartoon when Bugs finally convinces him to let him take his gun.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I can understand their relationship with each other. To be perfectly honest I'm not much of a romantic person and so most love stories just don't hit the spot. In this novel though, I loved the characters from the start because they were all so different and yet they all worked well together. The setting was definitely a unique one and the whole idea was very intriguing. The way the characters' stories interwoven with each other was pretty impressive.|0
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool effects and I really liked the scene in Paris. There were some nice nods to 70s cult movies like Barbarella, Rollerball and Soylant Green and I thought it was cool that the lead had the same look as Richard Dean Anderson on MacGyver. There was a big debate at the time as to whether this was supposed to be funny or serious. It's a little silly but I'm glad that it wasn't just a spoof with a lot of irony because it is a fun ride.|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are about to leave. The horse traders want to buy their horses, but the leader explains that the horses belong to God, not to man. The traders tell the leader they do not believe in God, and they are willing to pay a lot of money. The trader leader agrees to sell all of the horses if they are paid the agreed price. After the transaction is completed, the Mormon leader asks the two men if they believe they have acquired ownership of the animals.|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , I think he is very good at comedy and his character is one of the funniest out there . He really does a great job . The other half of the show is Carrie ( Leah Remini) , she is Doug's wife and she has many funny moments . She is a strong character and she really makes the show funny with her sarcastic moments . The two together are one of the best comedic pairings out there .|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying books from authors with which I'm not overly impressed. I've read two others in this series and this is the weakest of them. The story just doesn't have the intrigue of the prior books. I can only assume that since it was written later that it wasn't a priority to the writer. It seems that some of the books I read are so bad I have to wonder about their author. This is one of those books.|0
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. I’d like to see the film to find out how they got these shots . The photography was so beautiful that it almost seemed unreal. The film was definitely made for the 3D format. I enjoyed watching it .I’m going to try to go and see it in the cinema again to see if I enjoyed it so much or if the experience of watching the film in the cinema makes me feel so much better. I thought this was a fantastic film.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me its one of the best shows on tv. The humor is great , the story lines are great ,and I can watch it anytime and never get tired of the characters or the situations that they get into . There are a very few shows on Tv that I like to watch over and over again and this is one of them . If your looking for something that has action , comedy, mystery, and romance this is the show for you .|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
"`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals and also the award for ""best film"" of the year on the French Film Academy (académie des arts et des lettres du film) . `` The Apartment 112 112 avenue de Champagne'' is in the same style of humor . It's a comedy about an apartment where different people have different life experiences . In my opinion this film was not as successful because of the fact that most people in France don't like comedy movies ."|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I was expecting, and more of a drama. This is a very low key movie with lots of dialogue. The movie is really about four people: two men, and one woman who is one of their patients. The four are two doctors, and one of the doctors is their patient’s husband, the fourth man being the patient’s lover. There’s a great deal of interesting dialogue and backstory in the movie.|0
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was a waste of time and money, but the one that said it's the best movie ever, was the same guy who said that. It's a shame that this guy can't make up his mind. I think the reason why he liked the movie so much is because all the characters were just as pathetic as he is. But what do I know, after all I'm just a woman. This movie was very funny, I laughed a lot.|0
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled. i hope you will bring it back . Please bring this back I love this show! I watched the series when it was running on the BBC and was very disappointed when I found out you canceled it on PBS. I love this show, and have missed it since it ended. I love this series, and I hope that you will consider bringing it back. I hope that I will get the opportunity to own the series and watch them many times in the future.|0
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is very popular in the Russian literature. But it should be noticed, that there are two types of the works: one, which describes the process of the industrialization and modernization (Rosenberg`s 2-volume book on the history of the USA is one of the best example), the other one, which is dedicated to slavery and emancipation. The latter type is rather popular in today`s Russia, as can be explained by the general interest to history of slavery and modernization of Africa.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this quote is on the trailer and the end of the film
The movie is called The Color of Justice, and I believe the quote was something like, ""Your past is your past."" (I could be off on the actual quote, though.) In the trailer and in the movie itself, there is a very brief clip of Archbishop Desmond Tutu saying those words. answered Dec 3, 2016 by JPB (12 points)

"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' in koblenz germany. the first time the film was shown without english subitles. after the screening there was an english speaking talk with the producer peter gould ,the director rachel tunnard, and the cast . I liked both versions the original with the english subtitles and the international version with the german english dubbing. but i'm not sure if the international version is out on video in english or in german. there were several interviews with all the actors, producer etc.|0
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound impact on me at the time. I saw it again recently while on vacation in Washington D.C., and while the film hasn’t changed all that much in twenty years or so, my perspective as an adult has. I still enjoyed the film and I’d still recommend that people watch it. As a student of history, one thing I’ve learned is that history isn’t as neat and tidy as we make it out to be.|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , wacky and well acted . There were many twists in this movie . The beginning of the movie starts out very slow . But once the twists start to come it becomes one of the most enjoyable movies of the year . I definitely recommend this movie . This is one of the worst movies I've seen lately . I'd give it a 4 if it was just a bad movie I didn't enjoy but this was one of the most confusing movies of the year and I didn't like it from the start .|0
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta ,Georgia of the 1st movie. A few days before the showing I got in an argument with my mom and I flew off the handle. I had told her that I didn’t want to go and she told me that I had to go. I was upset that she was going to spend money for a ticket and I wasn’t. So she gave a ticket to the ticket attendant. I got the other ticket.|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. I’m glad I went to see it as I really enjoyed it and it was a very enjoyable way to pass the time. The story is fairly simple and there’s certainly a few plot points that are a little far-fetched and predictable, but I found myself getting easily sucked into the action. It was the sort of movie that doesn’t really stick in your mind afterwards but is still very enjoyable. It’s got a great cast in it.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw the movie as an adventure movie and I liked it . It's a must see movie if you have kids at home. Great Movie! Go Watch it! I really enjoyed this movie with my whole family!!! I thought they did great with the effects, and the story was interesting too. It's a movie for the whole family to watch. My daughter really liked it too. It's very funny and adventurous! I would recommend to everyone!|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully entertaining film. It is funny, well written and well played by a strong cast of young actors. My only disappointment is the lack of depth in the main protagonist. The film is about a group of 4 young adults, all struggling in their careers. We see them as friends but only through their eyes and not through the film. We get the feeling that there is a lack of warmth and camaraderie among the friends. In the end we see how they have grown apart.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's . Even if I have never read the book , the movie takes me through a period of time that I lived through at university . I remember the time and the feeling and the social mood . This is the last movie by Bernardo Bertolucci so far in my life . A nice movie to close this part of my life . Thanks . 5/5 Great movie, good actors, great story. The film was a bit long, but worth the wait, very interesting.|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to choose this masterpiece . This film also has a very unique style of editing . The music of this film is by the famous musician and composer A R Rahman . And of course the camera work is amazing . I watched this film on the day of its release . I think it’s a film which can get a lot of appreciation and appraisal . The story revolves around a man named Vishnu Vardhan ( Rana ) who is an army officer in Indian Army .He has a son named Ayan .|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be humourous and just boring. This series was a great departure from this type of comedy and although the plots are similar, the outcome is different. I would say that it's not for the youngsters or the oldies but it can be watched by anyone in the middle. I am 60 and I find the jokes are funny to me, some are in poor taste. It is a British comedy so you can expect British humour.|0
"I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the human experience, and a quest for the meaning of life. If you liked ""Kundun"", ""Dogma"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""The Holy Mountain"", ""Samsara"" and ""Little Buddha"", I think you should like this movie too. This is the sort of movie I'd really like to own on DVD. I recommend it for everyone. This film is a masterpiece of genre. I don't say that lightly."|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now before I get back to filming for my own show! So, today we turn our attention to Hi De Hi!. This was a series about a holiday camps for young children. I know that some people will disagree but I actually liked the show. It was fun and it had a great cast who worked together well and created a great atmosphere. The setting of a holiday park was also fun and very different from the usual sitcom setting so it made a nice change.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a 20 minute film , and it was one of the last pieces she did. It has a very nice mix of music and artwork . Recommended for her collectors only I think , although the music works as it stands without watching the film. And it has a 16 minute version as well. I've never felt this way about a work before but this is quite unpleasant to listen to. But then, that is the point. The film may be interesting for the Alice fans.|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1

I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across a news story of 2 brothers being attacked and stoned by 3 young men with stones. I could not believe my ears and my eyes. I could feel the blood of those 2 boys rush to my head and a burning sensation all over my body. I felt like a war was going to erupt. I asked myself if this was the same kind of life those 2 boys were living after their father had been murdered on a fateful day some years ago.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and we have just the best people on earth ! I love Romanians , you cannot compare a Romanian person to another, you will always find something new and unique about every one .

I love you !|0
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was this film, which despite being about a mountain climber who never came back from an ascent on the North Face of the Swiss Alps was more than enough of a box-office draw to keep the studios interested in the genre for quite awhile, as it went on to gross over $50 million. It was also the most expensive and technically most advanced film to come out of the Universal studio in quite some time, and the studio's most successful film since the ``Jaws'' cycle.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist I am often disappointed with the use of the term ""reel"" to denote a film that is not one. ""Reel"" was the traditional unit of measure for a film in the 1910s through the 1930s. It is not synonymous with ""movie"" or ""film"" or ""video."" If you want to be specific, a film is a ""movie,"" a ""film,"" or a ""video tape."""|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa’s Aids epidemic, but it is far from your usual sobby, overly sentimental portrayal of life in a black township in a country where more people have Aids than are alive in the United States. Red Dust is not about the disease or the politics, it is about love and loneliness and the courage of the human spirit. The story revolves around two young lovers, a poor black miner and a rich white woman who meet one fateful evening.|0
America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i am getting tired of it because it feels like the girls are getting older . They should have some young fresh models . I hope they get some fresh faces next season I am sure we will be watching . I just wish I could get my hair to curl. It never has, even after trying all the curling irons and brushes, and hair spray. What do you think would work? I'm glad that you're having fun with the new blog.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a middle-aged mother and her daughter Lydia. Lydia’s father was in Afghanistan but has come home for the first time after five years. Lydia is having her birthday and her friends are coming to the party. Lydia is looking forward to the party but it is not going to be a good one. Firstly Lydia discovers she has a spider in her hair and then her sister brings in a mannequin as a birthday gift!|0
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with my other items from this collection it has been passed down from my mother, I've never been able to part with these items as it brings back the memories of my mothers wardrobe that I'd look through as a small girl in the early days of the Egyptian tourist trade, and how it changed from then onwards. It's just so beautiful , it's a must have for any fan of Egyptian items , and would look just perfect on any vintage lovers door!|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It's not as good as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance or The Sun Shines Bright or Ford's masterpiece 3 Godfathers but it has a lot of heart and a good performance by Harry Carey, Jr., Ford's favorite, who he always wanted to star in his films. It's the story of a dysfunctional family that gets more dysfunctional when the oldest daughter gets sick with a fatal disease and needs a heart transplant. They go to New Mexico to find a replacement.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Michael Kamen . A friend of mine introduced me to it in the 1990`s at the same time I discovered The Who and Led Zeppelin . And that`s how I became a Michael Kamen fan. I had the priviledge to see Michael Kamen conduct The Kirov Orchestra (in Moscow) and the London Symphonic Orchestra in London twice in 1991 . He was always so kind and welcoming in the presence of a few fans.|0

I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the name of a building on the corner of 57th and 15th street in Manhattan. The building which is located across from the famous Chrysler Building. 15 park avenue is a 42-story residential condominium building built in the early 1920s. According to a news report published in the New York Times in 2011. In that report, it stated that 15 park ave sold for more than 100 million dollars. The report also stated that it is currently occupied by a family who is willing to sell the apartment.|0
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at the peak of their powers as they try to save the world from being overrun by marauding insects. There is also a romantic interest between a scientist and the wife of his boss ( Crawford ) . . The movie was not that well received in its day but it has held up well over the years . . Rod Serling ( TV ) had a small part in the film and he was quite good . I watched the movie on TV years ago but it left little impression .|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai has two jobs ( one being the town's baker), her boyfriend, her ex-husband, and a daughter she gave up when she was 16 to her parents. Rory is a very smart, driven, girl who is always trying to get ahead of the other girls her age . She is also in search for the love of her life and the first time she falls for someone else she finds out the person has a girlfriend.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . The first book in the series, by the way, was a best-seller so the sequel had to be even better (and it was). I love the first book and have to say the second is just as good. This time around, we get to follow along with Ma and Pa as they are off to Hollywood to film a movie. I'm pretty sure that most people have seen some Ma and Pa movies and they are pretty funny too.|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but last night I made an exception. I went to see an advanced screening of Aeon Flux with some of my friends. I'll admit that I had no idea what the movie was about when I got there. I had heard of the short animated TV show but that was about it. I'm not much into action movies so my expectations were low but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the movie.|0
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been looking for it on video for years, but I could never find it. Now I have finally found it . I have a hardcopy of the movie that I got in the early 70's, but I wanted a DVD version of it. This was one of the movies that made me a fan of Peter Cushing, in fact it was my first introduction to him , and it has been a lifelong love for me.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the camera on each person in the family, the viewer gets to know each of them, not just by the way they act, but even more, by their facial expressions. The story is told from their perspective, rather than the perspective of an outsider. The camera never wanders far, so we are with the characters throughout their daily activities. And the film is set in the house at 51 Birch Street - so we are always there too.|0
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , it is well written, acted and directed . It is one of my favorite comedies of the past few years . I was actually shocked when I read in the paper today that this movie under performed . It was number one this weekend , but the paper said that it only pulled in 4,150,508 dollars . It should have made far more. Maybe the fact that this movie was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar was the problem? The movie was up against some big names.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one dog. It's not a grand story of triumph. It's a personal and intimate story about how love changes and grows over the course of a lifetime, and yet it's not sentimental or overly emotional, either. I'm sure it's because the woman and the dog are very much like me, but I loved them both from the very first. The woman's name is Hollis, and she's a middle-aged widow who lives alone in the countryside in rural Georgia.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight is the best. He was nominated for an Academy Award. It is an epic story , one that I can’t wait to watch again. If you have never seen this classic, you’ve got to. It will not let you go. And to think it was filmed in 1976. Wow. It’s not a great film about the war, but it did give an insight into what soldiers had to do to fight the Nazis.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , the best contestants, amazing photographers and producers. The show was created by The New Yorker and Tyra Banks. This show was first aired in August 2003. It is now on its 19th season. Tyra has been the hostess from the beginning. There have been 20 seasons of the show. It started out on The WB network. From 2003 to 2007 the show was on The CW channel. After a few seasons the channel changed its name to The CW.|0
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought the DVD of it for $1.02. I didn't expect much quality in the film, but was interested in the story. This film is an historical fiction about Akhenaton and how he came to be a Pharaoh in Egypt. This film is very old and made in the 40's. The quality is poor by today's standards. It is still an interesting story though. The film is based on a book by George Roden.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie wasn't anything special. The story is about an older man (Ralph Fiennes) who recounts to a young woman the events and aftermath of a Nazi war crimes trial he'd been a part of. The main character, a teenager, had a passionate affair with an older man. The man (now in his 40s) recounts his experience with a woman in her 50s who had been his babysitter when he was 16.|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a big fan . I have heard good things about Robin Hood and I may check it out one day, I have not watched Robin Hood : Prince of thieves in a while so may check that out again. Muppets from Space is a great family movie , it has a few good songs in it too , it was also the last Jim Henson movie made before he died. I have not seen the other movies you mentioned, if you have not seen The Witches then you should watch that.|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford and Jack Pennell had to make do with a small location , no special sets and not too many extras . And it succeeds because the picture is not a big spectacle , it is just a little story well told . Several other Ford pictures are as good , and a few others are as good and as good as anything that Ford ever made . But this picture is something else. It is one of only two of Ford's pictures in the public domain , meaning it is not under copyright in any country .|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
"When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd hate to be responsible for editing this film. The movie was a mess and not a good mess, more like a really really bad mess . The characters were all a bunch of idiots who made stupid decision after stupid decision and then had no repercussions or real consequences for them. This is a movie you just sit and watch and say to yourself "" What the hell are they doing ??? "" The movie is about a group of students who go out on a boat to celebrate the school graduation."|0
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn worth it! I am also looking for 50's and 60's movies and TV Shows.I have a complete collection of old movies from the early 30s up to 1960. Hi, i would like to buy that dvd too. Can you please send me the link for it. Hi, I’m looking for 60's to 80's tv shows on DVD. If you have it, pls send a link. This is awesome. I would like a link.|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 500 other 10's this movie has. I had a lot of anticipation for this movie and I have to admit, I've been disappointed by the last few Marvel films. The only reason this isn't any higher than 9/10 is because I feel the last half hour or so is rushed and could have used more time and/or action. But I loved everything else about it. The acting, I thought was superb.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry westerns in which he lost his star, John Wayne, to Republic Studios. This picture has none of the elements which make Ford's westerns special. There is no love story, no big-time star, no big battle scenes, no cowboys, no Indians, and little gunfire. This is Ford's most realistic western, but it is also the least interesting of the director's pictures. The plot involves a small wagon party composed of Mormon emigrants who have been forced to take shelter with a traveling circus family.|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a 10 foot pole. A film in the same league as Beverly Hills 90210 is a bit too highbrow for me. But as fate had it: I watched it and liked it. Not only did I watch it, I rented a video copy (a DVD copy has not been released, at least not in the US). The DVD copy is actually a better presentation than the theatrical release. Bill Nye the Science Guy is a TV science show geared towards the education of kids 5 through 15.|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great respect and understanding. This movie was one of my favorites. Criticism is all the rage, especially of the Trump administration, but it is difficult to think of a better movie in this genre than this one, which, like its source material, is based on fact. The story, about how a small town in Nebraska (Bridgeport, Nebraska to be specific) became the site of a 1968 protest at a courthouse against the Vietnam war draft, is riveting from start to finish.|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's overly dramatic or predictable. However, this past year, I have started to watch some good shows. Here are some shows that have caught my attention. Dexter - this is the only show that I have never missed. I have also watched every season of it at least four times. Dexter is awesome. It 's very violent, so it might not be for some people. You follow a serial killer through his day job as a blood spatter pattern analyst.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name on it. I'd be curious to get a picture of each terminal at PIA and JFK with the full names of them. It's easy enough to find pictures of the PIA terminal but not easy to find a picture with the full name on the terminal building. Same goes for Penn Station or the GWB but that is a bit more difficult as there are a lot more buildings involved . There was a time when people would get out and run around taking random pictures.|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release has made it into one of the most memorable sci fi movies ever made. What I thought of the controversy is, if the scene was intended to be realistic, what would be the point of making a film that portrayed an imagined future? If they intended to portray a scene that was supposed to look like a future, why didn't they just use makeup and special effects? The whole argument is pointless. It makes no sense.|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and I've watched it before, but I enjoyed it more the second time around. I just wanted to note, that it's probably the only time, I've seen, that one actor, who's in it, play three different characters with three very distinctive personalities - and he does it so well, too!! It was quite funny, really - watching him in all the different roles - and all three are so different from each other, too!!|0
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I was still able to see in my mind's eye some scenes of the film but I was not sure if they were my own memories of the film or just of life in general. The film had touched me so deeply that even the slightest trace had left a deeper impression on me then many films I've seen. One of the great things of this film is that it doesn't give you any answers. It doesn't force you into thinking about a specific subject.|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , the kids were so adorable in it. I would watch it with my little boys when they are older so that they can see what real family means. It is very touching and it is great to know that parents can still be real parents no matter what the situation is or is not. I liked this movie and would definitely watch it with my daughter when she is old enough. I think this movie portrays a real story of what it takes to raise a family.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and request it to be sold on DVD for everyone to see . There was a lot of great talent in this movie with great actors and a great story . This movie deserves to be sold and I feel that everyone should be able to see this great movie ! I'll be emailing Disney myself ! ! ! ! ! It is so difficult to find this movie anywhere on the Internet, I think it was never released on VHS. This is such a shame!|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White trash movie, this is the other way around . Brewer makes you laugh at the people who have been pushed down on by the world , but in the end you feel for them as well. This is a well made movie , a good script and excellent performances from the lead cast . You will enjoy this if you want to take a break from some of the big budget action movies out there. I am giving this movie a four star rating, I really liked this movie.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in this period of our history at the time ) and it has become a firm favourite ever since. Although at the time I could only guess at who these characters were , they left an ever lasting impression . I am therefore delighted to now have this film in my possession and it has certainly stood the test of time , I find it as watchable now as I did when I first viewed it at that age.|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . It is a little slow in some areas , but not bad . I really liked it and I think you will too ! This movie is a lot better then the trailer made it seem . I liked the cast . I hope we will get a sequel . I will most definitely watch this again . I don't think I have seen anything from the director or the screenwriter but I would definitely check it out again . The director is new to the industry and he did a really good job on this one .|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and a brilliant filmaker. This is one of his greatest hits, one of a kind and one of the most underrated movies in history of cinema. Say Anything....is not the greatest movie of all time. And it's not a great comedian movie either. But what makes it special is the cast. Say Anything... is a fun movie about a guy and a girl and how their relationship changes throughout their relationship. The best part is how well the movie was directed by Cameron Crow.|0
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis to be read. But I would love to know more about the Tale Of the Cat and the Moon . I've got the book in my hands but I'm too lazy to read it right now... I'll do it after my mid term exam... I know you can't wait to read about it so, please write about it... :P.
This book is so so cute and funny ! The characters are so real. I love all of the stories and the funny little comments."|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I first saw it back in 1978 or 79 I was 8 or 9 years old when I first saw this movie and it is one of those that I have seen many times over the past 31 years. It is so well written , and so true. This movie is more then a movie this is a piece of art that so many people have loved through the years . It has something for everyone and if you dont have it you should run out to your nearest DVD store and buy a copy today.|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Hillel, Bob and the others sounded and looked great! It is a true testament to Lee's staying power as the best rock and roll singer of all time! I highly recommend this album to any Bob Segers fans! This is a must have. I have it all the time. You can't miss it!! Great to have all my favorite segers tunes in one cd! WOW!!! Just WOW!!! I've always liked Bob but this collection is AMAZING!|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , story and photography are what I would expect from a director like Polansky . I am not a fan of CGI but it worked here and did not interfere with the movie . The movie is very good , entertaining and thought provoking . Loved it , highly recommend it for a great movie night at home , it is a little different than your usual movie but it will keep you entertained and is a must see. This is one of my favorite films.|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a handsome stranger, played by Jim Carrey , when he checks into the local hospital where she works. The movie's story line was written by Steven Rogers , and is based on a 1980s British comedy television series called The Fall Guy that starred Bruce Forsyth and Ronnie Hazlehurst . The plot of the movie was said to have been the subject of many changes. The screenplay was the first of Zellweger's projects that was written specifically for her, after her breakout role in the movie Jerry Maguire (1996).|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the only films that uses real wolves , so when you watch this film , it 's not the usual fake wolf that 's being seen on the screen . And the film does a great job creating the suspense that 's needed to be a successful horror film . So you should watch this movie . A group of three young women , Jessie , Sara and Gina , go up to a camp ground in the wilderness with a group of men .|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. Like Antz , The Cell has a lot of fun ideas that would work if the movie were longer, or shorter, or edited in the right way, or with a different script. The movie does have a few dumb scenes, but it's never so bad you want to turn it off. If you do turn it off or leave the room during it you'll want to come back and give it a chance to finish.|0
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it is the most successful book of the world. It is the bible of the civilizations of the whole universe, it is the book of life, it contains all the knowledge necessary for the development of mankind, because it is the book of love. It is full of good examples of what a person must be in his daily life with all his fellows, his neighbors and the others. It contains all the good habits, it teaches how to respect the others and how to love them.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a feeling of sadness. Why should a film be so sad that it makes you feel blue for the next 2 days ? I felt the same when watching ""Brokeback Mountain"" a couple of months ago. It has something to do with the subject matter of these 2 films. There are 2 very good reasons why we should be grateful to Singaporean director Anthony Chen. One is the fact that this is probably the best Singapore movie I have ever seen."|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to stay in middle school and Stan, Kyle and Kenny get in on the action. I really enjoyed it and I'm going to try to get in a full review for the episode tonight or at least a couple of thoughts. Check out the episode and let us know what you thought about it. If you've seen it share your thoughts about it. I was surprised to see this episode on this list as I haven't watched it yet.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I’ve read compare this new film from Jake Paltrow to the former. That’s just plain ridiculous. I would rather not compare them and just enjoy both films as their own entity. It seems as though there’s not enough good movies released these days. I would like to say I don’t care, but who am I kidding? I can’t get enough. That’s why this movie is so good.|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to raving maniac, I never imagined that I would be able to use a line from the movie in my regular conversation. However, this past Friday, as I left work for the evening, I turned to my colleagues and in my best Tim Curry impression said: “Now go and boogie!”. I was of course, referring to a scene at the end of the movie, when the band playing at the club asks Alice to lead them in a rendition of “Don’t Bogie”.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a film about their lives. In this movie, black cowboys are presented as a group of individuals with similar life experiences to their white counterparts. These are men who came to the west from different regions in the United States to find freedom and a better life. Some of these men became successful in their careers, while others were not able to make a living as cowboys and had to resort to work on the railroad or in town.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen in the last decade. One of the things I love about the movies is that it’s possible to watch a movie that was made a couple of years ago and it still feels fresh and alive. This is a perfect example. There are several reasons why it works so well. Firstly, it has a brilliant and unusual screenplay – the dialogue is witty, sharp, funny, touching and realistic.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably been forgotten. The film is available on DVD, however, which is a relief. This is mainly because I have a special interest in the subject. I happen to be a member of the D'Oyly Carte company, one of the best known of all Gilbert and Sullivan companies. I have performed in the United States in this company. The film begins with a murder in a London music hall in the 1880's.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early nineties. Although I'd heard of the original version of it, this was my first real exposure to the character of ``Alice'', and I was surprised to find that I liked it! I liked it so much in fact, that I sought out the original script and read it. Although it had its moments, the original play (written in the early 1960's) was much more a standard play than a musical.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes , ears and nose . Great acting , great story , great sound . I will definitely watch it more than once. The scares really made me jump out of my seat and it didn't feel fake . Definitely would recommend . This movie is amazing. Not only because the story is original and different but because the whole production of the film is amazing. The sound effects, acting and costumes are on point. The story is original but the storyline is very believable and makes sense.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just like the american one, but then i saw them and i fell in love with them, especially with Lorelai. She is a character that i love to watch. She is not the best one for every day but she has something special and i think that she makes it easier to watch the show with her, because every time i have seen a scene i was always laughing and when she is sad i am sad for her. And then i saw the book she wrote and read it.|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm impressed with it . I 'm really surprised by how good this Thriller is . I don 't recommend it if you 're looking for action and suspense but it 's surprisingly good if you 've got some time and want to watch something to relax and be scared . This film is based on a best selling novel . It was well made and very suspenseful . There were a couple of minor things about this one that I didn 't like but the acting is good enough to get you over them .|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her three daughters living in a fictional small town of Orson, Indiana. They've managed to create a storyline that is filled with drama , suspense , wit and hilarity . The characters that make up this family are very realistic , they're not your everyday cookie cutter characters . They all have their own personalities , quirks and issues and that's what makes them so compelling . The actors are amazing , they portray their roles very convincingly and I love all of their different performances.|0
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is an amazing, well crafted album. I had the great pleasure of being at the album launch in July and was blown away by this album and the guys who make up Blue Planet. As an aside, the launch was also a benefit gig in the form of donations going to the Royal Marines Benevolent Fund, and to date we have raised nearly £2000, which is a testament to the calibre of the guys in Blue Planet.|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . We sat down at the theater around 10 p.m and didn’t finish it until 4 a.m. the next day . It was worth staying up for . The movie was really well done . This is the first time I’ve seen this story portrayed and it was well done . The movie made a really good point . I’d recommend this movie for people of all ages including teens . I would rate this movie an 11 out of 10 .|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks's `` Rio Bravo''. Well-written script , excellent acting and good camera work. A must-see. The movie is not without flaw, of course - as with all good movies it has its own flaws - but I enjoyed it thoroughly and would give it 4 stars. Very good movie with an interesting premise. The cast is good. I liked the ending. The film is enjoyable and a recommendable watch. A brilliant movie with good direction, by-the-book screenplay, remarkable dialogue, adequate cinematography and great acting.|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly enjoyed called, ""The Last Samurai."" I was looking for something to throw on and keep me occupied during my morning jog. I wasn't sure if it was going to suck, but it seemed harmless enough and I was already committed. This was a good choice. This movie has a nice pace to it, enough action and suspense to hold my attention, but not a whole lot of mindless shootings."|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) I have come across some interesting facts about Bugs Bunny . Apparantly the original design for Bugs Bunny was based upon Al Jolson ( which explains why the original version of his voice sounded so similar to Al Jolson in that it was also sung in a blackface style ) and he also used to get a lot of his mannerisms and lines from old vaudeville routines . I guess that's why he always sounds like he belongs on stage in most of the cartoons .|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Cabellero , and Andrew Reynolds . It was a good game for the n64 and I would reccomend you to get it . The graphics were very good for the n64 . I like the game so I would say that it is fun and you would have alot of fun . This is a very exciting game. I think you would love it. You would like the graphics the sounds and the fun of the game. It is great for the n64.|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . Riverdance, now a worldwide phenomenon - has been watched by millions of people. The show features spectacular costumes , breathtaking lighting and a superb cast of musicians and dancers. Riverdance - is an extraordinary blend of Irish song , music , dances ( including the hauntingly beautiful Reel of Times and Irish Coffee ) and footwork inspired by the traditions of the world . Riverdance brings together a unique and spectacular fusion of Irish Dancing and Music to the world.|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary and her young son become stuck in a small town where the residents believe that a witch is in their midst... In a small town in Connecticut, during the 17th century, witches were condemned to burn at the stake. One old woman, named Tituba, who had been a slave, confesses to the local ministers that she knows how to cast a spell. A young woman named Abigail, who was rejected by a young farmer named John, accuses others of the same.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her vagina while she pleaded with him to stop, he was so mad that he kept on going for a couple of seconds before putting it back up her vagina, this was such a hot scene in my opinion and the one I would love to play in a film, it was also the best sex scene I ever filmed by the way. It is a pity that the film is so old now as I'm sure they would let me play that part these days.|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could make the show so great . When I was a kid I remember watching it on PBS, I've been missing it and was so happy I discovered it on Amazon. It's amazing and a must watch, and I hope that it continues to be available on Netflix or Amazon. One of the greatest movies ever created !!! It's really a great show!! Amazon should make it available to everyone!!! I love this show so much.|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to get through life with a family who is trying to kill him , And trying to save the kidnapped daughter . A great read and I highly recommend . Thanks to Net galley and The publisher for a free e book to read . Loved this story. It was full of drama, action, a little bit of love, and a lot of suspense. It was not predictable and that's what I look for in my books.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years . It was in 1911 when it was stolen . There are two theories of who did it , one of them was a collector of art named Albert Gleizes . It was recovered in 1913 in Italy , so that is why some of the Mona Lisa painting was missing , because the thieves cut it to fit the frame , so the thieves did know the painting well enough to do that. Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist, Leonardo Da Vinci.|0

"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen felt that it's release was appropriate. I think it should be released now, because this is an excellent film and should be out there for viewing. This film is made with a lot of care, sensitivity and thought for the Carpenters fans. It is very interesting to see some old home movies, out takes from various videos and concert performances. There are a lot of great clips of Karen singing and the music is fantastic.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I had never heard of her and didn't know anything about her until I read the review. I am glad I did because she is great and the story is wonderful. The movie is very interesting and the plot is pretty good. I enjoyed watching this movie and would suggest this movie to anyone. This movie is a keeper and I would recommend it. This movie is really good.I love this movie. I saw it 5 times and every time I was surprised.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of this film. I loved it to death. For starters, I think it was very intelligent and well written. I 've seen most of the films on this list, and i must say, this one made me cry out loud during the first 20 minutes. I 'm not really one of those ""cry at movies "" people, and I was really surprised with how moved I was. I 'd say that this is one of the finest examples of a movie with an emotional pay-off."|0
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure but as a way to show the deep pain, suffering, and loss of innocence and hope that the main character has experienced and has led to the self-destructive behavior. The story plot is about a young woman who was raised by a very religious mother who has an obsessive compulsive behavior. She believes that she is doing it for the best interest of her daughter. Her husband was a very abusive man. In her early years she was sexually molested by her father.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange program from our university, which has been an amazing experience, especially because we're all from such diverse backgrounds. This movie was great! It is one that I can imagine all of us, all of my friends and family would enjoy. I will be sending it to those who have not seen. This movie was very interesting. Not only was the story fascinating, but there was a lot of humor. It was also great to see Paris in 1910.|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses there are less and less of Spanky, and as a result less laughs. It has the same basic plot as the first film except it is bigger and more spectacular. But the final reel goes on too long. I give the film three out of five stars. (Click the link to read my complete review. The film was originally released in 3D but the only way to see it today in 3D is by using a converter which makes the film look terrible.|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's. Johnny Guitar is not very different from other B westerns or westerns in general. If the film has any difference, it is in being a western in a place where it was not supposed to be, the American West. This is the difference that made it a film with a certain importance. The film tells the story of a former prostitute who arrives in a village in which there is a feud between a cattleman and the local saloon keeper.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one that was actually filmed in the south. It was a low budget film and John Ford did not have a huge crew to work on the film. Because of this Ford did not use the typical camera angles he would in other films. Instead he just filmed with two cameras and did not use wide angles . Ford also did not use a lot of lighting and instead filmed during day light hours . Because of these limitations on the production of the film, the film is very realistic and raw.|0
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very definite path for the first four seasons and then went off the rails and ended up being much worse than those seasons. But in my eyes, season five was where the show really started going off the rails, which makes this film a bit of a mixed bag, but for all of its faults, I still enjoyed this film a lot more than the first three episodes of the fifth season. I also think this is a pretty good episode for those that don't care about continuity issues.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of ""Snow Angels"") there have been no more episodes of The Office and the only ones to be shown are the short webisodes (which are very short, I don't know how one could consider them ""episodes"" but whatever), so there isn't much to update. I will try to update this site more often! I'm really hoping for a full season order for The Office next year. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed!"|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and beliefs of the USA, in the 20th century, with other great nations of history. The film follows the development of American Exceptionalism from its origins, during the American Revolution, to the 21st Century. The narrator is played by actor Gary Oldman. The documentary takes a historical approach, focusing on the cultural, political, and economic forces which have made America the most powerful nation in history, while at the same time examining how those forces have contributed to the downfall of American society at large.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars ,`` it was better then the last one . A few of the story lines did get a little boring , though in the end, it was all worth while. This show is the only one I ever bothered to record on my Tivo , and for the most part I have been really happy . I hope it continues to entertain me , because if not, well that is another Tivo I don`t use. I was a little disappointed in this last show.|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed so much the first time around). This is the most beautiful film I've seen this year so far. It's the sort of film I'll probably be revisiting again over the next few months, just to marvel over the visual feast that it is. I have no idea what the film is about in any kind of intellectual or plot sense, I'll just say it's a visual feast for the eyes and the brain.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie which you will call ""fake"" and you know why? because all the scenes are true. There was no ""exaggerated scene"" or ""exagerated act"" in the film . All the actors did a pretty decent job and so did the actresses . Sonu Nigam, who was the voice of Rahul in the movie sounded a lot like Rahman. There was nothing much you can criticize in the film . Everything seemed real."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does a wonderful job in telling the story from a number of different perspectives and the way it portrays these very human characters is a major triumph. I really like the way that the director and the actors tell the story without coming across as sentimental. It is an honest account of the hard work, anger and hurt that people have to go through to make a new future for the whole of a country. There are some very moving scenes that are played straight.|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 more times in that year and I can't get enough of it. It's my all time favorite animated film. I'm not the only one that thinks so, because it won an Academy Award for ""Best Animated Feature"". The story is about a young man named Arthur. He works as a mail carrier in London, England. He's an awkward young man that doesn't get along with people and doesn't think much of himself."|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in theatres in the US. This is the first film directed by John Ford. The film has many elements that were used in Ford’s later films. The title of the movie is based on the song “Beautiful Isle, The, of the Sea” from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta H.M.S. Pinafore. The film begins with the crew of a merchant ship stealing a bottle of brandy from a British man-of-war, then drinking it. The man-of-war then attacks the merchantman which is then boarded.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the quick pace of an adventure novel. Once again, I was fascinated by the factual account of a historical incident. In the late 19th century, San Francisco had become one of the world’s richest cities and the city was in a period of growth. Much of that growth came from wealthy merchants building grand homes for themselves. However, it was the merchants’ workers who helped construct the mansions. And when the building was done, the workers and their families had to move on.|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts like a little child and makes everyone laugh , I have not seen anything like it before . My wife and I have seen several of these films and find that this one was not as great as the others. Perhaps, it is because it had a more serious tone, or perhaps because we have seen it so many times. Still, we liked it. Not as good as I'd hoped but still enjoyable. I've really enjoyed watching all of these.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right ! I have read a number of books recently that have the theme of someone out there killing people in the name of God , whether it is because of religious fanaticism or just the need of a killer for killer , this seems to be a current theme at the moment in many of my books. I am not really sure what it is about , whether it is just the time that we are living in now , or is it a sign of our times .|0

I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of B. J. Arbogast a tough woman trying to make it as an actress in Hollywood. It was a well written film as the story line was good and the actors were good too. Not a big movie but worth the watch. This movie was ok. I've got to be in the right mood for this kind of movie though. I'm glad I got it on DVD for $1 from Wal-Mart. Raquel is always great and so are most of the actors in this movie.|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
"Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . I'm ok with that because as long as they can laugh at themselves . Now I was going to upload a song and video about Al Gore and An Inconvenient Truth but the stupid youtube banned the video from being seen in America . Labels: climate change global warming al gore

`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of the underclass - the homeless population, drug dealers, pimps , thieves , etc . - , with that of the middle class and the police . All these groups are in constant and violent conflict - and the protagonists of this film are the ones who have to pay the consequences of their behavior . It is a very entertaining movie with good actors . This was a very entertaining film about two people from different backgrounds . It was well directed and it has some good actors .|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film.

Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the first part of the story, Betty ( Renée Zellweger , in the best performance she's given yet) is a seemingly normal, suburban housewife, who works at an insurance office in Colorado. One day, she finds herself having a nervous breakdown and is committed to a local mental hospital. But the hospital is full of crazy people and she's not sure if she's in there or if she's actually escaped.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's not the kind of movie that will take you by surprise , but rather, it does not give you the sensation of having wasted your time when you see it the first time . Susie Q has a lot of good actors , and this is one of the things that makes it a good movie to see if you are looking for something to watch , especially on weekends and in the evening, when there are no special events to go to .|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot. Let me start by saying I am a huge horror movie buff. I own over 700 films and watch 15-25 horror films a month. This film is a horror film that has a strong storyline as opposed to just gore with very little substance. So many films nowadays rely on just gore . The gore is what draws in the audiences to these horror movies. If it weren't for the scary gore, I would have probably passed on this movie.|0
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this with no clue of who this book or author would be about . I had n't heard of the book before and I was pleasantly surprised . In fact at the beginning I was going to rate it 4 stars , but I have changed my mind to give it a 5 stars , that is how much I enjoyed it . This is a book I would read again and a book that I would recommend . I have already put the other books from this author on my to be read list for 2020 .|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends & Neighbors ) creates a black comedy that is equal parts fun and disturbing. Starring megastars Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Rene Russo and Ashley Judd, Nurse Betty is a surreal and twisted journey into the dark recesses of the human psyche. Freeman stars as Jack McKay, the wealthy owner of a car rental company. Rock plays Cliff, a slick, fast-talking salesman. Russo is Carol, Jacks unhappy wife.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I enjoyed watching it . It was a pleasure to re-discover the film , which I saw in my childhood , but which has become for me a very special memory . For all those who love the legend of King Arthur , this movie is a real treasure .
"" Excalibur "" by the legendary John Boorman is one of the most impressive movies of its era : a beautiful film in terms of its scenery , its photography , its interpretation of its characters , its beautiful music and its great battle scenes ."|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . . . or maybe `` Grey '' , I think that was the other one. Blue and Gray were the color of both Union and Confederate uniforms in the Civil War, so it's likely that both sides had Blue-Gray parties in the post-war era. I'm not aware of any other ""colors"" for people of this era - I don't recall a Blue Party or a Gray party in the 1920s (the Roaring Twenties). I'm not sure where it originated."|0
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Soup ( 1933 ) constitutes the third and final phase in Chuck Jones's illustrious career. These were Jones's finest works, and the only time that he was able to bring his full-bore talents as a director, writer, designer and animator to bear in his own productions. It is a sad truth that few of Jones's later cartoons compare favorably to these masterworks of his formative years. In the late 1950s, Chuck Jones produced several animated shorts and commercials for Time, Inc.'s Warner Bros.|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything '' is like that. Most of the book is taken up by the lives of three women: April, who is married to a philandering businessman whom she's ashamed of; Henrietta, who is married to an abusive alcoholic with whom she has four children; and Sondra, who is married to a nice guy who has no prospects. These are the best of everything the 1960s had to offer: money, power, prestige, and men with no brains and no backbone.|0
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my . I don't care if it's the storyline or the acting, this movie did not do it for me.. See No Evil Movie Review See no Evil is not the best horror movie of this year or the last two years. It is just another mediocre horror movie that will be quickly forgotten. This is the first movie I have ever walked out on. I watched the first 30 minutes of the movie and couldn't take any more.|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford directed was 3 Godfathers. It has a great theme - three men and a baby have to get across the desert to bring in a $5000 reward so that the man who brought up and loves them can inherit it and save his family from bankruptcy and the men from hanging. There is a sub plot of a man out for revenge on the three - he has lost his own wife to his partners in crime, and now has the chance of killing the three men he blames for her death.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who turns into a super-hero and battles against villains while dressed in a skin-tight catsuit and stripping for them. The character is loosely based on the pin-up girl from the 1960s. It was the first show in the Adult Swim block to be animated using Flash animation. The show premiered in October 2003 and ended in June 2004 after 17 episodes. All the episodes aired at 1:30 AM on Tuesday nights. After its cancellation, reruns would air at various times throughout the block until its removal in June 2005.|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it. But, the first half of it was very weird and funny. After that, it became boring and it felt like a regular rom-com film. It's like the film had a weird start but the director decided to put the film on the straight road and become predictable. The film was enjoyable but I would've prefer it if it was more on it's weird way. It was weird in a good way. I like it.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again years later the experience is completely different. I had seen Khalnayak so many years ago and had absolutely loved it. I was a bit apprehensive about how I would feel this time. So what I had loved as a teenager, did I still love as an adult? The answer to that is yes, I did! Yes I can still love this movie even after so many years. It was such an entertaining movie with a fantastic screenplay, superb performances by the leads and a fantastic story line.|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that`s very important. I like it when they use real people and the things are not so far from life as we know in real life. It`s very cool and interesting . I think it is the most interesting part. But I don`t want movies that show us that we must be perfect . Every person is not perfect, so it is impossible to be so . We must accept it and move on in life .|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 4,2006. Wow, is the word. A must-see for those that love the American Revolution, and for all those that don't really understand how it all happened. This is the true history of the first war fought by these United States to be free. This 3 part mini-series should be mandatory history in all our schools. A wonderful job by everyone involved. I will definitely watch again and again. Thanks for keeping history alive for the world.|0
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just watching him and his antics . He'd have been a fun guest on the show . Maybe even a one-off episode . Heck , if the show is canceled , and we get a series finale , it would even be a great send off . Maybe the writers can put him on the show . Sadly , he died in '96 . Maybe the guys at AS could do something tribute type thing for him on a future show ? He was a very nice man and a talented musician , singer and actor .|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1

"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
"In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a comedy. It is a story about a family of two and how they are trying to be a family of three.

The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone help me to find any movie where Tiffany Amber had sex ? There have been lots of movies I've seen staring Tiffany Amber where she has sex, but none of them has been as good as this one. I'd also like to know who Tiffany Amber had sex with. I don't need a full video or anything. I just need a few pictures or something. If you could please email me any of this I would really appriciate it.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have read the full story , and this only covered about 2 years of his life , the other 30 are just a mystery , the story is told as if written for young readers . It did tell a little more than some other films made about him , so I was glad to see that , the acting was ok , and I was disappointed at the ending . This is a really good movie, but don't expect it to be a historical document, or an epic biopic.|0
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he got his break in the 1970 television comedy `` M.A.S.H. '' -- but in `` Sweet Liberty, '' he has a ball playing a sneaky, sex-crazed movie producer who wants to make a movie about the church, which he considers an easy touch. In one of the film's best sequences, the producer is in a restaurant and tries to steer two nuns out of their habit and into something sexier -- without getting caught on camera.|0
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. The first is a well acted drama about a gunslinger on the run from his past, the second a well observed, naturalistic comedy western about a mule wagon train heading for Oregon . 'The Gunfighter' is an intense, well played, psychological piece, directed by King with his usual careful style. It has a strong script, good production design and photography, and an excellent cast, with Gregory Peck's performance as the central character, a very believable figure.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone thought we should put that song in the movie instead of `` What are you going to do '' and when we were in post production I think we were going to put it in . But it never quite worked. It just was not the right time . I never heard it after that . It's hard to explain . I mean , I have listened to that record over the years but it's never gotten to be something I really thought was a masterpiece.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch all the jokes. I loved the characters and I thought they were amazing! I would recommend this to people of all ages. Everyone should see this film because I don't think there is any way you could not like the movie! It is one of the best movies this year and I really don't think it has anything to compare to it yet this year! My favorite scene is the one when they are all dressed as animals. It made me laugh a lot!|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV show that they want to turn it into a movie . `` But when I actually saw the movie I was pleasantly surprised . After I saw it , I was very happy and I really liked the movie . The main characters are very likeable and there is not a lot of unneccessary jokes , but there are jokes . I also like the movie's twist ending , it is something I have not seen too often in a movie .|0
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I’m surprised that it’s only had 372,000 views as of right now. As a huge Disney movie fan, of course this movie holds a special place in my heart as well as so many others. I watched it on Christmas, but you can watch it whenever, just remember to watch it! If you haven’t seen it yet, you’re in luck as it’s free!|0
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. Along the way the men learn that it is not always easy being a cowboy. There are cattle to handle and fence to build and the men help the women with the work too. After a few months they go back to the old ranch and work together again for a while. Soon though the men decide that it's time for them to go their own way. They bid the Mormon family goodbye, and go back to the old life.|0
"A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of American society at the end of the 19th century with the attitudes of the United States in the year 2000. In the film's prologue, a voiceover explains that the film will take us on a journey that will answer a simple question, ""How did a country that once believed in equality and freedom become the most technologically advanced and wealthiest nation on earth, but also one of the most divided and uneducated as well?"|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic sites . I've only seen the movie 20 years later and i still think it is a masterpiece . I know this movie changed my life for the better and I hope it changes your life too . Don't watch this movie alone . Share this movie and make it a family movie night . I went in to watch this movie with an open mind, ready to accept its flaws &amp; give it points for what it is.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Good, The Bad and The Ugly``, and which was later used as the opening to the 1986 movie `Sharkey's Machine` starring Sean Penn (who plays a very young Sharkey here). In one of the opening scenes we are introduced to Sharkey (Dick Van Dyke), and a few moments later the scene changes as we see Sharkey sitting on a hilltop looking down upon the village below with his back to the viewers.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , ends with a satisfactory solution. But I find that, in order to be able to enjoy these books, it helps to know what was going on in previous entries in the series. This one, of course, is no exception. The Saint is in Spain, and an old friend - who was the Saint's first love but who later became the wife of an aristocrat - dies and leaves him an enormous amount of money, but only if he will marry her.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the pattern of many movies which preceded it such as Zodiac , Silence Of the lambs and the aforementioned Se7en and Fight Club . If you follow this formula it's easy to get a sense of déjà vu . But in the hands of writer - director David Fincher the result is more than the sum of its influences . This is an intelligent, intelligible and intelligently made movie , with a superlative cast and an original screenplay .|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the Easter holiday and found it a fresh take on the historical facts. I think they also liked the romance. I will be showing the movie to my students in the near future and I know they will also be engaged in the romance. I think it is important in today’s world that history is shown to be interesting instead of the usual dry lectures that many students have sat through. It is important that students learn to love history.|0

Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it and you will want to watch it every time you can. This film is filled with so many suspense scenes, it will really make it hard to keep your attention off the screen. It is one of the best horror films from the 80s and it will leave you with a chill all over your body. The plot is about a small group of friends who go on a trip together to find a cure for their friend who just recently had a nervous break down.|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever seen. Gilmore Girls should have at least gotten an Emmy for the acting of the cast, it was flawless , and the writing was also flawless . It is also the only show I have seen that is very intelligent and very well written. I started watching it as a freshman , when it first started airing on The WB in 2000. Now it is in the middle of season 6 on The CW.|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love the show is because its the closest thing I have ever seen to my family. Its just the right balance of funny, romantic, and sad. I have a huge crush of Dean (I think they should have ended up together) and Luke, I'm sorry, but the guy is adorable! So I just thought I should let you all in on what I have to look forward to with the new season.|0
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like "" Stagecoach"" , or "" The Searchers"" or "" Shane."" That's a good thing, as this fast-moving B western is a well-done , exciting , fun action movie , with good performances by the stars. Most movies have one main character whose role is the most significant , as is usually the case here. Robert Preston, who starred in the ""Music Man"" on Broadway and later in Hollywood movies , is the main star here , playing a good-hearted but stubborn sheriff in a small Western town."|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in a very deep way . As I was watching it , one sentence was echoing in the back of my head : `` When you have a life long love , why do you leave ? Why do you leave when your love is so deeply ingrained in your soul ? '' It got me wondering . How would I react in a similar situation ? Would I give up everything I have , the very life that I have worked for years , in order to spend my life with the person I have loved ?|0

Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats just because of the same writer. The main character is a man that lives his life on his own way. He has his own way of thinking about life and he does whatever he wants. He works as a fisherman that has a great respect to fish. He is really intelligent and has no friends but he has a daughter and lives in a flat with a woman. When the girl is grown up he has to leave her and start his new life again.|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . This movie was filmed in a different manner than many other movies. This movie is about the life and times of an old woman. It focuses on her thoughts and actions . It makes you wonder if she is insane .This movie takes you through a time of the 60's when the women movement was becoming popular . The movie is mostly about an old women who lives with her sister who works at the local movie theater .|0
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student life in a bachelor’s college . I am not quite sure where I have heard of this film but I liked the sound of it . I had no knowledge whatsoever about this film , but it seems to me that it is a very light-hearted , enjoyable and a complete laugh riot. The story is set in a small college named St. Francis college. The college’s student body comprises only of men. The film revolves around three of its students .|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning with A. 15 Park Ave, San Francisco, CA is a 5 bedroom, 7 bathroom, 6,610 sqft single-family home built in 2003.

Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it ! This movie has a lot of potential to be a great movie. First of all the movie has an interesting plot. The main idea is pretty good and well thought ! Secondly the characters are amazing ! Every single one of them is so good ! I think the acting is brilliant ! The movie has such a great cast, and every character is very well portrayed. In addition to this the soundtrack is brilliant ! The movie has a great mix between classical and modern songs.|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a man (Christensen) who has to save a woman (Kidman) from lusting after a local musician (Kinnear). As she tries to redeem her soul, they form an intimate bond that threatens to ruin his marriage. I give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars and I have it as a movie worth watching, and a must own to all Rae's movie fans . Black Snake Moan will be released to DVD and HD DVD on June 5th.|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films (I still have a poster of it in my room!). I’m sure most of you have seen it already, but I don’t think I’ve ever reviewed it, so let me remedy that at once! The opening scene is brilliant. It starts with Nic Cake (Rose Byrne) talking about how her grandmother was in a car accident and, in her words, “she died, but it’s okay cause she died in a car accident.|0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw the first series and found the second not so good. However the last episode which looks at divorce was the most interesting and the one I kept watching the most. You need to be in a calm state of mind while watching it so you can truly appreciate it . This is the best documentary i have ever seen , it is so inspiring and really makes you stop and take stock of life and family relationships .|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. Directed by Jean Cocteau, the film is more of a psychedelic dream sequence, than a story. There is no storyline in this film. You will not understand what is happening on the screen. That's what it is about. It is a dreamlike film, where you try to find some sort of logic or meaning, but you can't. This is the film's genius. You are left staring at the screen , trying to come up with a meaning.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to give it a watch on Netflix on a night when my wife was out of the house. I found that it was much more enjoyable than I had remembered it and even my kids had a good time watching. I can’t say it is a great movie but for 90 minutes, it was good enough to hold my interest. The movie is a comedy about a family that takes a trip to visit a distant relative and finds out that they live in a town that is inhabited by giant animals.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
