I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad. This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and cliché', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch this on lifetime, I'd recommend it highly as a comedy.|1
This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clichés, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions! !, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!!|1
This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy.|1
this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making . the pacing is poor , the budget must have been cut and put in on a whim . the only thing i like about the show ( which has a decent cast and a good crew ) are the actors . they are very professional actors , at least that is what the reviews say . however , the acting is so atrocious that you could probably skip the parts where the dialogue is completely horrible and even worse when you start to feel like the plot is really bad .|0
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother.|1
we ' ve all seen bad movies , well this one takes the cake . i ' ve seen that junior movie and even watched it on dvd as a kid . not sure why , but i was curious to see if anything in it could possibly be considered good . what they say is true . you just watch the same old movie over and over again every night for about 3 hours . i can see how the film would get boring if someone left it with a stupid title . the problem with the movie is that people are actually going to watch it so many times at the same time .|0
talking about competition features at the split film festival , we have titles from all over the world . china was one of our favorite places to watch it , but now it 's in japan , and i just hate it . this movie was not as bad as you would have expected a japanese film critic to make it . its action scenes are so good that even i had trouble reading them . the main thing that really bothered me about it was the fact that it did not have any action scenes with the people who were supposed to be making it fun .|0
the main problems of ' saw ' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just get out of . i can relate this better than most , which is because i did n't know what to expect from it . there was no time to even think about how we should react to this , since the rest of the cast also knew and understood the concept . but the plot was not so bad that they did not like the movie . the show was quite good ; however , the character wasn ' t a complete ass - wipe .|0
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'Redux' slapped on the end of the title  I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?Well it's not too hard to figure out really.|1
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful.|1
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on TV or I've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much of a mess.ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first time director and it shows.|1
"i ' m not surprised that so many people fell for this one . when i was watching this movie , i thought it looked like a "" bad acid trip "" movie , but i never actually got to watch any of the videos because they did not seem to have anything in common . the plot seemed to be rather lame and boring . it is very difficult to make up a good story in which you do not know who you are or what you want to do next . there are lots of interesting things going on in the movies ."|0
THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes.|1
would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie ? i had to watch it three more times before coming up with the plot so i knew that it was not really a nice film . in all of the films we saw , it seemed as if everything was just a joke to them and nobody cared what the outcome was . how could they not see that the only thing that could make this film good on tv was their love life ? but why did no one care about these two actors ?|0
"if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs , i ' m sure it would sound like the best plot line ever . "" "" you really are an ass * * le , "" jeremy says in frustration . i have never seen anyone with such a great sense of humor . he ' s right though - this movie is pretty lame . i think it ' s just what people need to be doing for fun . besides that , i don ' t think any of us will get any more enjoyment out of this one than we already do ."|0
This is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list.|1
` ` delusion ' ' is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile . it 's a shame to watch it - it looks great , but it does n't show very much of the real thing . i just do n't know what it is . i guess it could be the most dangerous movie ever written . all i know is that i have seen a lot of horror movies over the last four years and this one is as good or better than anything i have read . i was hoping this would be an interesting night out in san diego but i think i was wrong .|0
found this film for one dollar ( $ 1 . 00 ) and the film was a complete waste of time . i really could n't help but feel that we were not doing anything right , just trying to get by . i ca n't even say how many times i have actually seen a movie in which there are too many mistakes and bad actors . i mean who wants to make mistakes ? then again , perhaps it would be more fun if you let me make mistakes for you . i certainly never wanted to mess with your brain .|0
the first season of bones is playing in finland and i ca n ' t believe the amount of bullshit that this thing puts out about itself . it really should have gone away years ago . how could it ? i would give a lot to see something like this happen to someone who lives in the city ! but this show is n't going to be much good if there is no talent involved in it . its just plain dumb . as i said , these guys are obviously amateurs . they will never know what real talent can feel like or even taste like until it has been experienced for a while .|0
I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. The second is from someone who has. (Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice.|1
this is definitely a touching movie , and a great expression of charles darwins personal struggle . the movie is so well written , i 'm tempted to turn it off right now . it is a good thing that i do not have to look at the script for more than sixty minutes , because otherwise i am going to miss out on this one . when i first read it i did not believe in what i was looking for , but after seeing it with my own eyes i realized that there is no point in trying to figure out who made the characters .|0
Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious.|1
Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on.|1
What on earth happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. Every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, I might add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in.|1
"I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% top notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep ""FOREVER!"""|1
Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.Seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme.In Marked for Death, Seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation.|1
"with the war not going well for the soviet union , stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the soviet bloc as a way to start his campaign . at the very least , you should have seen this . "" "" how come he is so good ? "" metcalfe asked . "" what did he really do ? i mean , what were his actions ? was he involved in any sort of criminal activity ? "" lana laughed out loud . "" it 's a long story , but yes , he went on an illicit smuggling route through the bosnia mines ."|0
warning : i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment . if you plan on reading this as a whole , you will also be amazed at how easily you get bored . it has no real meaning in the modern world except to say that it is just a story about a woman with her husband and two children . when one finds out that someone is watching the movie , it 's hard for one to stop thinking about it . but what does it really matter ? the only way to keep from looking like a complete idiot is to look like an idiot .|0
lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies , mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond . but a lot of them were not . in some , it was just about how bad he would look at you when he saw you in this film . in others , it was as if he knew your name before you even came out to see it . though i doubt this film could have been good enough to go through so much time and effort on someone 's part . here is one that really gets me thinking . this film is probably the most boring plot line ever written .|0
Finally! Other people who have actually seen this show! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. It is just hilarious. 'And so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' And some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience.|1
First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I have watched it almost 10 times just because I've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece.The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert.|1
i really wanted to like this film , especially after all the buzz i ' d heard revolving around it . however , a few of my friends said they saw something else that might be interesting . one of those things is when someone who is actually in a movie dies , and you want to get back into the party scene . i ' ve been trying to watch this film for over a month now - i was so caught up with it that i have not even had time to read the plot . but , i am starting to understand how these guys got the idea of doing such a dirty joke .|0
"i saw this piece of pseudo - intellectual crap a couple of years ago , and it is now making a comeback on the television news . "" you think you 're doing everything right , but then you go and do all of these horrible things that your brother does to his wife when he ca n't pay his bills . "" what a crock ! i never thought of this . why would anyone do something so stupid ? why would any of us ? i just wish i could believe in the god who loves our parents and will take care of them ."|0
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lays as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride.|1
being a fan of bela lugosi , boris karloff , and lon chaney jr i had to see this . what tripe ! there is almost nothing to write about . the only real reason i can think of for making a film was to make a movie that was n't even supposed to exist in the first place . it was so stupid . by the time i finished the first chapter and went back to my office to check on the screenplay ( as if it would have mattered ) , i started to enjoy the movie . i am not much of a theater fan , but every movie with a plot is an adventure .|0
"My wife and I couldn't even finish the film. Truly, it was rather painful.First, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For instance, Augustus takes the ""burden"" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.Second, the camp! My lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this."|1
I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch.|1
i was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the far cry game had been created . i found this all so disappointing , and i think you know what ' s going to happen if you ' re not there with your friends when it gets started . it is just like some kind of science fiction show , where they are supposed to find something in the future , but no one can ' t do it . well , as i have said before , i wasn ' t talking about the aliens ; i was talking about the aliens .|0
"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (""You're just making it up as you go along!"" ""Yup, but I do it brilliantly""), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of ""get on with it""."|1
"Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss Sergio Martino's gut-busting ""L'isola degli uomini pesce"" (called ""Screamers"" in the United States). Here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men."|1
i loved this show . such talent ; and i am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only about a month . there are some great hits with the action as well as the music . the film was not what i expected to see for myself when i came out here . however , i will never admit to it because i do n't know why i read it . it should be on the television , in a movie like this one , not on youtube . but even if you had watched the film , i bet it would not have prepared you for what you see now .|0
i am 17 , and a biased muppet fan , and while i love treasure island , christmas carol and horror movies make me squeamish about this . but i did watch it with you guys last year in new york . my mom is the first person on earth who loves this stuff , because she had to ' do something ' to change it . i would love to see how her day ends . if you are wondering , let us take a moment to thank all my best friends and family . i have to say that this movie takes up a lot of my time .|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb, Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller.|1
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I too, had liked Russell and Pare ""back in the old days"" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I did return to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded."|1

this version of ` ` the magic flute ' ' is not only the worst production of mozart ' s great opera that i have seen , it 's one of the worst productions i have ever seen . but when you get back to the beginning of a movie , it does look pretty good . at first glance it looks very ordinary and predictable , but after seeing this work , i know something else is wrong . what should i do about it ? there seems to be some sort of code between the two operatic orchestras .|0
This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. The plot is something that's been done over and over again! However, this one does it the worst! The acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. No one developed any concern for the main character. The movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie.|1

much as i really like catherine zeta - jones , i wondered once again , why remake a good movie ? this movie was the last piece of an old puzzle that was about to be put into place by one of the most influential actors ever to live . in this movie , and on all the films i 've seen , it has never been any fun to watch . when you get back to your home , you will find that there is only one thing that bothers you anymore : what happens when you enter the movies ? where is the movie going to end up being ?|0
"Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - ""eXistenZ"" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (""P.R. nerd"") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth."|1
fun , entertaining movie about wwii german spy ( julie andrews ! ) falling in love with american pilot ( john mcguire ) who has taken up a real role in the film but is never seen again . this movie is made in england and it is called ' the war of 1812 ' that is supposed to make it interesting . i want to be a fan of some of these books and would like to find out what they contain . for information about the author , please visit my website or blog at http : // ebooksmade0.co.uk .|0
mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment . . . and fair play to him . i always liked his story , but i 've never read one of these . you can see why he has such an enjoyable time at home . for the most part there is nothing to do . i am not sure where all of the humor comes from . what i have seen thus far is quite bad . the only reason that was so good was that it had been played by a very bad actor . we are all in this together ; it would not be difficult to write a great deal about this comedy .|0
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster!|1
john knowles modern masterpiece , a separate peace , are one of many subtle , and subtly is the watch show that i watch when i am at work . on occasion i look at these films , but they are usually too dull to be worth watching as they are an abstraction that can not possibly be worth seeing in person . however , it just might be interesting to watch the movie from a distance if you like . i think it will be fun . all i care about is whether this film is being filmed in front of or behind a camera .|0
ca n ' t say this was n ' t made well . at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took longer than expected , and it 's true that we all loved being on tv in the summer . unfortunately , there was never much good about it , but it just could n't be done . it has been a great project , as far as movies go , but we can not really believe that it is the best thing to do . the first few years of this film were very dull and boring .|0
"when i finally got around to seeing this film recently , it turned out to be exactly what it looked like from the start . in the middle of the first scene , i saw my wife 's face staring down at me from one of the cameras , and her voice coming out distorted by the microphone that came out of nowhere . she was sobbing loudly with tears streaming down her face . i remember thinking , "" this is the worst day of my life ! "" i remember feeling very tired and just wanting to go home before the movie became a disaster ."|0
"The first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!For me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of ""different"" sailors- I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialog by heart. Kelsey Grammar with his ""God I LOVE this job!"|1
i can not understand why this 1971 hollywood production is currently only available through an australian video company , but it is interesting to see what we might find there . as you know , the director of that movie was a well - respected writer and film producer who made films in his spare time . so , i guess this was one of the reasons for the change of venue . while he had given me a very generous amount of money to stay close to san francisco with him , i still thought it was a waste of money because of all the drama in the world .|0
it starts quite good , but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are prepared for . and this is no exception . in a short period of time the film has lost all its vibrancy . the whole experience seems as though it would end up in an era that will probably be over in a few weeks . i suggest we try to move forward with this movie . maybe we can do some good at the same time . now let 's see what our friends have to say so far .|0

"I was so excited to finally watch ""Pulse"" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of ""A Tale of Two Sisters""."|1
"This film reeks of production line planning. It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film does address the age of the Stewart/Allyson performers; though, I'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.There are messages in ""Strategic Air Command"" I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick with one truly wretched element: The happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife."|1
But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there isn't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims.|1

I loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students."|1
` ` love life ' ' explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a man . it is a story in which the two women fight to maintain control of both men . this story is quite short . when the wife goes home with another lover ( as i am sure that you will ) , they do not try to keep them together . so , how does one know whether or not the couple is lovers ? the answer is obvious . there are many people who claim to love each other , but for one thing they do n't .|0
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.If you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one.|1
Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime pictures (particularly Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need, and was ahead of its time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-WW2 France. Its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off.|1
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach.|1
the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on . the action scenes are some of the best ones ever made . i have to admit it 's very good . but when you see a movie with an old man and a nice young woman at work that do n't make sense , well , that just does n't go down well . i have only been to the movies for about four months and my life is so much simpler than what i have experienced in those first four months . no , i really am more of a writer who spends most of his time playing a game rather than actually writing one .|0
"after the across - the - board success of my name is barbra , cbs television permitted barbra to create an even more elaborate movie series . while i could tell she was happy with it ( but not that happy ) , her characters always seem to have a funny effect on the actors . the main difference is they also seem to be able to perform their roles perfectly . if you watch this movie , you know there is only one explanation and it is the most terrifying thing i have ever heard : it is a classic horror flick starring "" the queen of new york "" ."|0
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who's usually an amazing actor, was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt was given nothing to work with here.|1
this amusing , sometimes poignant look at the hollywood detective genre of the 1940 ' s and 1950 ' s stars robert leach and charlie sheen . for me it is not a bad picture , although i am sure some of the actors in it have suffered from it . i do n't think we should waste any more time wondering about that movie , though . we just need to put our heads together and figure out what we can do with this information . there is no question now who may be behind this plot or why the plot is so twisted .|0
the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then ending with the story getting to the bad end , where it turns into real - world war zone . what 's in this movie ? there were several scenes when it was too dark for me to see details . first off , you will be surprised how little information you are able to pick up from any of the characters on this set . i did some online research after seeing the movie and i thought i might get something that made sense out of it .|0
i saw ` ` sweeney todd ' ' on broadway in 1980 . it starred george hearn and featured most of the action , as well as some pretty great dialogue . a couple of years earlier i read a book by richard thompson that had to do with the new york city stock market crash , and was not happy at all about the movie being shown in print . after viewing this movie , i was more excited than any woman i have ever known . i mean , what would be the point ? it is just a lot of garbage . the actors are unconvincing , but they look good .|0
this turned out to be more of a women ' s romance - soap - suspense film than what i hoped it was . . . . simply because this character is very hot and has so much charm . the guy is a real pain in the ass ( even though he tries to act like he 's being nice about it ! ) , but his personality is pretty awesome and there is just something charming about him . the story starts off with a cute little girl as she meets her father who happens to be looking for a new boyfriend .|0
First things first, I am by no means a picky movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch to be entertained. I'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching.|1
i ' m so glad he was n ' t alive to see this . this movie is a debauchery of his work . why would someone kill a young man on stage in front of all these people ? i don ' t know , it could have been a movie with some funny plot or even good acting . it just didn ' t seem that exciting to me . and the film itself was boring as hell . i do not know what my friend thought about this but it was quite bad . at least i can tell you there were two other movies i watched that did not end well .|0
"...I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told ""we need at least 90 minutes"", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. Music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score I've ever heard."|1
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. Sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridicious.I have seen bad acting in my day but this is NO acting. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. I hate to see his fan club.|1
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.I couldn't have been more wrong.This movie was just awful. I don't recall a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I've wanted my money back. You will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags.|1
well , after the hype surrounding the film and after surya labeling the film as path - breaking , i went into the back bedroom to get some clothes . there were three pairs of shorts hanging in front of my closet door . two of them were a pair of shorts and one was a sports bra . all of them seemed like they could have belonged to someone else . i grabbed the first one that i saw and stared at the picture . it looked like an old family photo , with four men sitting next to each other , and a few women standing around looking very attractive .|0
it ' s out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia . apart from very distinctive differences in her height , her complexion is absolutely perfect ( which is n't saying much since she ' s a lot of things ) . although she doesn ' t have a bad face ( she has an excellent chin - dimple on one side ) , i can ' t see how someone as beautiful as her could get into the spotlight . she didn ' t look like she had many faults , and when she looks at you she really does seem to give off some of the world ' s greatest acting .|0
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD by it's cover. I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. The music was pretty ordinary.|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations.|1
Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets: a walkman, and nudity from Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked there is absolutely NO reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that one. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.|1
pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror , science fiction and suspense . if i had been paying more attention to watch this film , i may have seen it more frequently . i can remember the first episode being one of his best films ; i saw him on stage in an office surrounded by a hundred other actors all dressed in business suits and looking as if they would rather be somewhere else . he was having so much fun watching it that he did n't notice me sitting right behind him .|0
to paraphrase the previous reviewer ' s comments , if you ' re a stooges fan , avoid this one at all costs . i don ' t care if you write about me in this story or not ! as a matter of fact , i don ' t know what the difference is between these two books so i didn ' t bother listening to any of them when i made my first entry . and anyway , it ' s been over a year since i ' ve seen this movie . there ' s really little to see .|0
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker(Scott Bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. During a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one.|1
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some Indians who speak in English and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north Indian plains. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars of India in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.|1
cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive.|1
"Countenance! Antoine Monot, in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, understated old-school bard of ""There's something about Mary"" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. In visual allure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere."|1
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time.|1
this movie is bad . i saw the rated and the unrated versions . they are terrible ! ! now , if you see any good stuff , do n't miss it . these movies have some great moments , but they are not as great as the ones we get from the producers . this movie is going to be better than any other that ever has . i got my first taste of this movie in college . when i had the chance , i gave up on reading the book because it was awful . there were only three characters , one of whom was an old friend from high school .|0
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer.|1
` ` jefferson in paris ' ' is a truly confounding film . it presents thomas jefferson ( nick nolte ) in the worst possible way , with some very ugly scenes . as to what he should do next ? i have a better idea . first , there will be a sequel to this movie , based on the version written by the american and french publishers . this one is still considered good for a horror flick - if you like the bad part , well that makes it more funny . the plot was basically simple - but the main character was a little bit evil .|0
**Spoiler* It gives away the very irrelevant ending**At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But, then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 galloner.|1
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal.|1
. . . and in this series , i ' ve been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle . remember the good - looking one who went to college with my mom ? his name isn ' t funny , it ' s disgusting . he didn ' t look very well dressed , even if he had money , which i can ' t blame him for . that was another thing , the only way he could have looked good would have been if he ' d gotten out of his clothes and given them to her . what a joke .|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
"two years after this short , the last ` ` our gang ' ' short was made . after seeing this , i could not imagine what it really meant . "" he stopped and looked at her again .

This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know.|1
i tried to give this show a chance , but it really does n ' t sit well with me . although i got ta say , it ' s not as bad as it sounds . there was an interesting plot here , so i made a few comments on what i found out . i didn ' t really understand why anyone would need to go back to their old lives when there are some pretty nice people who live in a nice neighborhood , and that is exactly what they do . the best feature of this show was the way it was filmed .|0
ed ( kel mitchell ) is a teenager who lives for his job at good burger , a small but thriving eatery in new york city . he recently graduated to a career of film writing . his first novel , which i know you will like because this is a good one , has an amazing story . it is based on a group of actors who have had a rough childhood . while they were making their way to hollywood , they all fell in love with some of the people they met in the movie . most of these men were not very nice and that was no surprise given how well they acted .|0
"In fact it was awful. The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. It was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. Sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? No they aren't. At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a ""creative writing"" course. Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure."|1
this film is replete with sentimentality , unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe , and irrelevant material that makes you wish i had died of cancer in my early twenties . it is not worth reading the book , so i was hoping to get some of the plot out there tonight , just for show . although i have enjoyed all the stuff that is published on the website , i am not one to waste time looking for a good movie . however , i am grateful to be alive and working as an assistant to the acting department .|0
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content. The uniforms and weaponry of both the U.S. and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weaponry of the Berbers were perfectly accurate as well. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful. Procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for.|1
I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it.

This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England.|1
This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie.|1
As Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age, a solid script, and some great Disneyesque songs, and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed, without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.This is simply fun, but it is also a well made, well written, beautifully endearing classic.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.|1
"This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink ""I Never Got to Say Goodbye"", is the song come to life. You will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing."|1
"it ' s just when a band tours , and only has one original member . it ' s not the same type of thing i was talking about . what do they see in this movie ? is there some sort of lead - up or action plot that is so interesting that they don ' t have to go out for dinner at a local mexican restaurant every time ? who ' s taking all this seriously ? where are the films going to take place ? "" don ' t say that ! he ' s joking around ! why would you think these films will be good ?"|0
this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time . it ' s dull , ponderous , badly directed , and i will not even be able to get a decent laugh from watching it . if you are going to see this movie , there is no reason to risk your neck for something as trivial as sex in front of a camera . but i can ' t find that funny . it was a bad film to start with ; the audience looked like their hearts would burst out of their chests and ran down the aisle to the theater .|0
demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs . it is definitely an awful example of a movie with all of the bad endings . that 's one thing you should know about this movie . i just wish there were more good comedies to watch . i would rather enjoy this movie with my friends , if it was n't for the fact that it makes me angry . i mean , did you really need to see this ? i hope you like it but i am so disappointed in myself . i have always enjoyed this movie even though most of the reviews were uninspiring .|0
"this was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen . the acting was god awful , the story line was really bad and the character was incredibly inept . not only did the actors fail to remember the dialogue as it should have been , but they were just plain dumb . it was so horrible that i wanted to leave immediately . however , before i could leave , the director called me in again . 
 "" well , let 's hear it , "" he began . "" how much do these guys have ? "" "" three thousand dollars , "" i replied calmly . """|0
rating : 8 out of 10 . directed by alfred hitchcock . tennis star guy haines ( farley granger ) meets the director 's wife as he is taking a long break and she decides to act out in front of everybody . this is how it all started . first there was a movie about an old lady who could n't afford to buy groceries , then an old lady with her dog , and then a young man who came into the house and played a couple of role - plays . so many people do n't really make much sense , but for one reason only : the movie is bad .|0
well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly.|1
i ' m a petty officer 1st class ( e - 6 ) and have been in the uscg for 6 years and am not fond of that sort of thing , however , i can see why he did it . i hate to admit this , but my first thought was that you were out to get me , although i do not know where you learned this kind of thing . no , it just seems like you wanted me dead . oh well , i have enough reasons to go around killing people . i will be honest , i would never want to kill one of those things .|0
i just discovered this obscure ' 70s horror movie while browsing on youtube . for a low - budget effort , it has one of the most horrifying characters that you will ever see . the actors are young , and there is nothing to make them feel as though they should live in the world with their mothers and brothers . after the movie , the story is no longer interesting enough for me to go back to the beginning . i have already decided to write a sequel to the first time i was released from juvenile hall .|0
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.|1
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show.|1
Ordinarily, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy stars. But in this B+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men.|1
The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went down hill from there. Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots.|1
mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment . . . and fair play to him . i always liked his films better when they were being made out of plain old plastic . this film is actually good . i was so caught up in the scene with the actor that i never paid much attention to what he said or how it ended . i saw the movie for only a few minutes before it had to end . i remember the character who first told me about the film , but that was n't enough to make me feel comfortable .|0
JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects.|1
this is a total piece of crap . it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert . i love all of their stories , and i 'm really curious about where the plot was . so what do they think ? did they make it out ? ' ' i am going to have some fun ! you should see my work ! ' ' oh dear , i have seen many great films from the time i first heard of this film . but for the rest of the film , there just is nothing in it that makes me want to eat more or sleep less .|0
how anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous waterloo bridge with vivien leigh and robert taylor at their home in new england . what is even more beautiful is that no one else was watching this show . they were n't even paying attention to what they were watching ! i do n't know what 's wrong with me . this film has gotten better and better since i moved here . i am not good at this sort of thing . there are about ten other people in this room who enjoy this movie . when i get a chance , i 'll watch the movie , but it could be worse .|0
"This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the ""suspense"" of Disney's Snow White, was chuckling through out the entire movie. My first warning should've been that it was in the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But I have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can't fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the DVD, it was actually $3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies."|1
"If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed her name as a ""headliner"". I picked it up thinking, ""Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!"" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie."|1
somehow , i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing . it just got out of hand . the movie was awful and did not sound as good as i thought it would . i am sure if i had seen it several times i would have been happy about its bad performance . there was something very morbid about looking at a rock like this . the more i looked at it the more i found it funny . the plot was too stupid to be funny but the character could not help but feel like he was having some kind of fun .|0
"I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. The only plot summary I can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high. (Spoiler alert starts here...) When the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the ""Demon Cop"", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a Halloween costume gone wrong. A car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running."|1
"Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie--who woulda thought? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed--""Wisdom"" (with then girlfriend Demi Moore) and ""Men at Work"" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy films---badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on in pure curiousity--it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if it didn't pull me in.It concerns Estevez coming home from Vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there."|1
this film has its detractors , and courtney ' s fey dresser may offend some folks ( who , frankly , she ' s got nothing better to do than sit on her bed with a book , listening to her rant ) . i don ' t think i ' m the best person to judge that film . my first impression of it wasn ' t very great , but there is no telling what the critics will say when they see me here . why are you so interested in these things ? i really didn ' t pay much attention to it before .|0
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! What possessed the filmmakers to do this? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! Do not see this film. And have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue.|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. People just don't act that way in real life situations. My question is: Who would fund such crap?The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes.|1
It's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre I find that Novo is an insult to Se Souvenirs.|1
"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork."|1
forget what i said about emeril . rachael ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all the time has made it very clear that her career is not going well for her . this is one of the things she hates most about her movie . she is always looking over her shoulder trying to avoid me . however , from my perspective , when i first saw her , she looked like a cute kid who needed someone to make him laugh . in fact , i do n't even know if there was any real laughter left in her .|0
"how sad it is when a film as wonderful as ` ` jurassic park ' ' slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre american culture , ' does not have a sense of adventure in the way we do . no one has ever thought of anything like this before .

"" they have all gone to bed early ; the movie will stay on until morning . if anybody notices me , maybe they 're glad i decided to come . i ca n't wait to see how it goes - because it really is an amazing thing ."|0
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this. This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one...Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II!The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).|1
i cant put it any simpler than that , this is a terrible film . i ' ve worked in the same industry as many other actors and actresses . i had an awful lot on my mind while i watched this horrible show . i thought that there would be nothing very exciting to see . i wasn ' t wrong . this film was really boring . the lighting was not good . the cast was just mediocre . there was too much tension in the atmosphere so i didn ' t know what to do . but the director seemed to think he should go first .|0
"Two years after this short, the last ""Our Gang"" short was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. The quality of ""Our Gang"" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unfunny and Froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of film making."|1
a satire about greed and money , what ? there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than anything else in the world has ever been shown to me . for all i know , we are not even in the country yet . i am starting to think we have missed out on an important point . i mean , ok , it was a couple of weeks ago when we started thinking this was going to be a good idea . at first we were just trying to stay out of their way . but now i realize they could be dangerous .|0
"I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came on A&E some years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actresses. This has got to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. The storyline of this TV version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! The ""kicker"" (pun intended) comes when Ruth has surgery done on her leg bones."|1
i have always loved the muppets . though most children ' s entertainment then was n ' t that likable , the muppet - style musical is actually quite fun . if you had seen the music in the late eighties there would not be enough to get you interested in listening to it . this has got to stop ! but what a great way to start my life . one day i might even find out what happens when the movie starts and i get to watch it . i am happy with how the film turned out so far . i really wanted this movie to go on as much as possible .|0
"throughout watching ` ` end of days ' ' , i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to scare off an old lady who was about to be beheaded . but it seemed a little too dramatic . one could have told you that the original version of this movie has been used in several other movies at various times - in fact , most of the original films have been used for the same reason . in fact , they have all been used to scare off anyone who tries to stop them . "" "" why is that ? "" ben asked .

I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. This anti-Bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film.In its campy, inane way, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion.|1
I haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie is one HUGE non-sequitur! It is an affront to the noble B Western films of the '30's. I have seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.The bad guy is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches.|1
Take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? Something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing.Seven Alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film.The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere.|1
"Everyone has their choice for ""worst movie they've ever seen."" Some like to pick on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some pick on classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14 I have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel the exact same way. It's not ""one of the worst,"" it's not just an expression. It is THE ACTUAL worst movie I have ever seen.How much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie?"|1
"this movie is a must see for any war movie buff . one of the greatest movies of all time , and it never got published in the usa . it was originally based on an old - fashioned movie film titled "" the battle of the bulge "" . what i think you would notice about this movie is when the characters were trying to win a war . they were acting out some kind of plot which involved people fighting off their enemies as well as each other . i ca n't even explain how i do not understand why most of the characters behaved so bad ."|0
* * * slight spoilers * * * this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit ( but only a little ) and it has an interesting story . the movie was made by jack mcmillon in 1999 , and as a result , the screenplay is slightly different than i thought it would be . i have to admit , i was n't expecting this one - not to mention the plot . but that film is just plain annoying ! how many times have i sat through this thing and wished i had never seen the movie ?|0
Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue.Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.The plot rambles on.|1
this film is just as bad as ` ` the birdman of alcatraz ' ' . i do not refer to the movie with any familiarity but i will if you tell me which movies you think are better than that one . what was the purpose of the movie , anyway ? ! it certainly sounded like something a person would want to see . and there was no sign of them in any of the pictures . they must have gone back to their old self and been caught in some kind of trap where they were eaten by a snake or whatever .|0
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found that even the mighty IMDb didn't have it listed. That should have been all I needed to know.With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only one that I gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge.|1
"i saw this last night in fort lauderdale . in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially . i know some of you have seen them before , so they are all very amusing . i think a lot of you have heard the stories from other writers but not many of you really have had enough time to understand them or to enjoy the story as it is written . for that reason i wrote this scene . there has never been an "" incident "" between these two characters because they just seemed too good to be true ."|0
this film sucks a big one . so many holes in the plot . if the devil is invincible , why do people put up with him ? but then again , there 's no way the devil is invincible . the problem is that most of the scenes i have seen on this film make me feel like i could get used to this crap . also , here 's the deal : the only place that i actually feel any real attachment to this film is on the cover of old - fashioned sci - fi books . they just happen to be an easy copy and it really does work .|0
disney - like entertainment with some un - disney - like moments of graphic violence and sexual references . lousy comedy alongside cliche - ridden moralizing . noah is the best actor in america , and the movie is one that has never been seen in the past . it is made up of very funny dialogue and a good acting ability to put things into better order . the ending does not have to be too bad for the characters . the actors do not seem particularly interested in making sense from the start . at least , i do not think they care about any of the plot other than those scenes .|0
"Altioklar: Master of the thieves. Watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched ""Identity (2003)"", ""Saw (2004)"", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said ""Eureka, eureka""(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It took only 10 minutes for me."|1
An obvious cash-in on the *Insert Monster Here* On A Plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you'd expect it to be. The film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. Although, it is fun in parts, I must say. The Zombie-action is particularly entertaining. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel.|1
the original ` ` psycho ' ' ( 1960 ) is widely considered as alfred hitchcock ' s best work and certainly , if not the best , i should say in the most appalling of ways . but these are the main characters . what do they want from a movie such as this ? what can they possibly want with a horror movie ? and what makes them feel so special that they try to have sex with someone just to make their film better ? is it all part of some sick game designed to scare people away ? well , i think you get the picture .|0
NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't allow my children to see this. I definitely would tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof as to why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network The producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot wasn't even born when this event took place. Did anyone attached to this project try reading the Bible?|1
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. With that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. Well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next Wednesday's episode.|1

by jove , what an unholy mess ! revenge , incestuous love , mechanical games - like fighting , ceaseless and utterly unsatisfying - are not a good thing . there is no sense of joy in killing someone just because the victim does it . i hate how much this movie makes me loathe people who kill my friends when they do not have the money or skills to be killers . that is why i can not believe anyone would create this kind of monstrosity . i wish i could say that i was sick of watching movies , but all i am capable of doing is trying to find a place to rest .|0
The 1980's 'My Dinner with Andre,' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'You Are Alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. The story revolves around three principal characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae.|1
it ' s complete nonsense . i ' ve studied nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the ` ` parallels ' of these biblical prophecies , as well as others . i know that this is not an ordinary bible story but one that has nothing to do with christianity or religion . in addition to being the original manuscript for the whole film , it ' s also written by two characters ( 1 ) , who can ' t have done it . there are two people who can ' t do it ! this was supposed to be a movie set for a different type of life .|0
"OK, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" and expect it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance."|1
horrible acting with the worst special f / x i ' ve ever bore witness too . it ' s bad enough i wasted my life in some of the worst horror movies ever written ; this is even worse because there is nothing to look forward to but a few scenes in which you think you know something , yet you ca ' t find anything out about it . what are they really watching ? what makes them happy ? if you didn ' t have a bunch of other actors who would have had a better story than these guys , then you should feel sorry for them .|0
"Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. ""Scene Of The Crime"" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre."|1
"i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching hoods and it was funny ! how is that even funny ? "" "" it 's funny , honey , because it actually sounds like a joke . but there really is only one explanation for these people ' s actions . you see , most of the crime movies are not based on the real murders , but they seem to be portraying the events as some sort of attempt by the police to catch a criminal . this movie is supposed to give us the closure we have been looking for ."|0
once upon a time , way back in the 1940 ' s , there lived an actress named veronica lake . when the movie was over , her parents died in a car crash and the story became one of horror - show - like episodes that had nothing to do with the movie or the movie itself . after seeing this film , i took it seriously and made a few more films before i realized it would n't make much of a film since i was only seventeen . ( not that i 'd seen this yet ) . but i did enjoy it .|0
apparently this movie was based on a true story . i ' m not sure how accurate it is , though - i never read the first one . it ' s just that when i get to see it and find out there weren ' t any real people involved , you don ' t hear anything about them in the film ( except for the names ) until you see the picture of a young man in a dark suit with black hair who looks like someone from another world . this movie is even worse than before . this movie is bad enough to make me look down at the ground as i drive along .|0
My mom and I, rented this movie. I mean, we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they be big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks.But oh, we were fooled!! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small city in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. My mom and I believe in god and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. All I really have to say, is that we are Christian, but even we like to have fun.|1
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. Predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.The staple of roman porno is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh.|1
"this was the first chan film made by monogram . what a come down from fox values and standards ! it is about a young woman who goes off to work one friday morning and comes home to find she has lost her husband . not only that , but there is something else in the film , something that needs to be mentioned . here is how i see it : 
 the story of a family who once lived in texas ' s past lives as members of a close family whose names are not really familiar to any one living or deceased ."|0
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good rendition of the story. I enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. But the second half was horrible!!! Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie Scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from God.|1

i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work . it only took a couple of scenes to make me regret ever agreeing to it . i was sure this film would be one of those movies that you can see in a movie . it is just plain stupid . the only good thing about all these films is the quality of them . they are not really interesting or any of the other films , so there is no point in trying to figure out what is going on . as for the ones that seem fun and entertaining , do you mind watching one ?|0

Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping. Were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy. Most of the cast are content to simply phone it in, and don't really seem to care about the film in the least. The writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the name of the actors that respectively play them. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old REALLY quick. Even the late great character actor, Brion James can't save this stinker.|1
this is an odd movie . on the surface it ' s no different to many other d - grade gore movies but there are some similarities and i ' ll let you off the hook if you go to the conclusion that a film like this is not as good as these others . in fact they all seem to have something going on , although i am not sure what . i think it is the same type of shit that would be written about in the middle ages or even around the beginning of the 21st century . why do we watch these movies so much ?|0

"This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. However, the movie had some dumb parts about it.A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that ""J.J.'s dead!"""|1

see three colors : blue and three colors : white . they are both wonderful films and will give an excellent soundtrack to the film industry . but this is a different kind of film : it is actually more interesting , much more entertaining . it is also a bit of a letdown when you have to watch the entire film because you ca n't make out what i am watching . i mean , what is wrong with the plot ? the story seems like a waste of time ; that is not why i came here .|0
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie.|1
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.|1
"drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen . here are my characters . "" what do you want ? "" a film director who does not care about money for anything but his career tells you that he wanted this to happen . no one wants this to happen . any movie worth being paid to make it as good as this should be made based on the premise of a tv movie . this series , which were based on two major events in our history , has just started to pay attention ."|0
This movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt, Julie Andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates.|1
"Went to the Preview Engagement of ""Grand Champion"" today (Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. Though the plot is a little ""Hokey"" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. Director/Author Barry Tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment."|1
"this one and the one prior ` ` toulon ' s revenge ' ' and the next one seem to be completely different from the one before . "" "" yes , they do look similar . i think we should have gone with a theme for these two movies . the story has no plot and there seems to be just a few people who see something that is not there . the overall theme of the movie was bad ; the dialogue was horrible . i want to see this film . i have never seen such awful scenes . what happened to this other guy ?"|0

the mod squad is n ' t a movie , it ' s a void . that ' s the most fascinating thing about this film , because as far as i can tell , there ' s nothing else in it . even the plot is ridiculous , but i was happy with this one and am glad they decided to use the same premise to build a whole new scene . however , all of those movies are not based on what i expected to come out of any of them . the director actually made this film for his daughter - in - law who has a child she thinks is an adult .|0
"although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired , it does serve well enough as an anchor to a romantic comedy : i never got to know her in this film . that night , after we got home , she asked me if i would tell her all about it . then , i said "" yes "" because it seems like so much more fun . i am telling you how funny the movie really is ! the acting is so lame , i could have written something better . but i did n't . i was too engrossed in my movie to ever think about writing something better ."|0
when a friend and i saw this in the recent releases , we decided to get it despite the fact that some of the reviews were rather lame . however , i just could n't help myself . those are my favourite movies . every one of them was great . there are so many things i can add to the movie that i have to be careful with . these characters are usually bad . they are very funny and sometimes even scary but they also are really nice . you would not want to date one of them after hearing about his childhood .|0
This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to end it's third season, and all hell IS breaking loose in this episode. The Charmed ones bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor the protect him from Shax, The Sources assassin. When Shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. He blasts Prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. Then blasts Piper threw what is left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before Shax came kill the doctor.|1
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. The locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. It just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. Only in the Mediterranean I guess. Certainly in no world I am familiar with. The macho men were really obnoxious, and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long.|1
....OK, small-town, clueless sheriff? Check. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of sheriff's hot daughter, whom sheriff hates? Check. Corporate land developer who greedily puts profit over people? Check. Developer's rank-and-file accidentally unleashing a primordial monster, then being pressured to cover it up? Check. Natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were? Check. Amateurish CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check.|1
"Well Folks, this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however, the additional downside includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline.It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediatly ""focuses"" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days) and his parents are coming to viusit him."|1
"i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance . i have watched the original from several times and i was impressed by how they portrayed this scene as one that has not been seen before . ' he paused and then said "" now you are about to get an interview with the president of new york "" . i really liked it , but i still would much prefer to go out and see what some of the movies were like . however , my curiosity got the better of me . there was such a long wait for the second film that i almost gave up ."|0
I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. I'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't the executives at NBC have any class? I feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story.|1
"i watched this movie with big expectations . the blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a great movie . the plot did have some nice characters who were funny , smart , and cute , but this movie really made me think it was all about sex . my brother and i found it hilarious , so we decided to watch it together one day . i am pretty sure i said something dumb like , 
 "" i want to fuck you ! "" or "" i wanted to bang you once ! "" or at least kiss you . i had never been kissed ."|0
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job.|1
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your films with a guy you can root for, and relate to, if you like your films in black and white, you gotta see this film! Watch it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a beat. It is sometimes slow, and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen, then when the plot begins to unfold, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was!|1
Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane.|1
jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy , insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous ; but if you are in any way connected with this film , you just want to see it . i have no idea who these characters are , but as the show continues , i do n't know what it is supposed to be . i do n't even know whether this movie is actually good or bad . all i can say for sure is that it certainly is n't anything good . oh , boy , the worst part is about how horrible it is .|0
"this extraordinary pseudo - documentary , made in 1971 , perfectly captures the zeitgeist of america today . . . which makes it all the more amusing . why else would you go out to a party full of men with guns in hand and women who look like hookers ? it 's not funny to me . i 'm not even sure it was funny as a kid , either . "" brad looked down at his hands and then into the eyes of his sister . she was watching him carefully . he knew it was true , because he had just told her the same thing many times over the years ."|0
i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood to this point , but not anymore . now i am content that i am doing my job so that i can see what will happen if the project fails . i wish that i would have been more diligent in my reading , because the only thing i could do was go back to the book and look at the movie , but i just never thought of that . i liked the movie because it was funny and the dialogue was pretty nice .|0
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary.|1
ohhhh man this movie is awful ! ! this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name . it really does n't make any sense - i just wanted to see a movie in one of the many films that my family made , and we had to watch a bunch of them in order to make sure we got something decent . i do n't know why it took me so long to realize that all three parts of this film were very stupid . you need a great actor , but you 're not even going to get an oscar for comedy .|0
i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks . what ? ? ! ! i ca n't believe the man was actually reading about this thing . it could n't have been that awful . who is so blind as to think someone else would write something like this up ? why would he be doing this ? i mean , how would anyone even know about this stuff ? i thought it was terrible and now i am here at a movie theater , which makes me really wish i were in a better mood .|0
"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(..in a running gag, anytime he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment."|1
I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it.|1
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
This movie was bad on so many levels. The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable. It's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie. I mean if anyone has seen any of the Police Academy movies, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His Character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from Characters i have seen him play before, so that was a plus. And I did think that Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie.|1
First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot.|1
simply put , paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable . the movie is less about the raw science of the characters and more about the story . the characters are as good as possible . it appears that this may be some kind of a ' comedy / comedy / comedy ' production , but it is absolutely nothing like that . if you believe in such stuff then you understand why it has to be so bad . i do not know what would have happened if i had been able to write a little bit of a comedy on this set . how could i ever have made it happen ?|0
"Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams "" Depalma , DePalma , Depalma ""Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own ."|1
it is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists . sometimes , even without the 20 / 20 viewer , i would watch a film or listen to a cd . but today , it is a special treat and for that i am truly grateful . this documentary was not in the script , so let me make one last thing clear . there will be no more films about my time period as a writer . you should know that from the beginning . what we all need to realize is that i never want to write this film again - ever !|0
realistic master - piece . thirty years later , the pictures can look a bit old , but actually , it only looks about five thousand years old . i love to watch the films of the great movies , but this film is totally useless . my favorite was the one about how people who kill other people do things that they have not done before . for some reason , i felt bad for these people , and wanted to keep them alive . now , however , after watching this dvd , i see that there is really little point . i just thought it would be worse than this movie .|0
Its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... But ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.I like Patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie..... ARGH....This movie is so booooooring, the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING.|1
step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . the film is funny and fun , but also pretty bad . there is so much of the dialogue you would be able to see without looking at the plot if you really thought about what was actually going on . for instance , the character ' s parents were murdered while they were being held against their will ( which in turn meant that they had been killed by the kidnappers as well ) . one of the reasons that the movie made this film was because it has always seemed to be quite humorous .|0
I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features, and classics, you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son), and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it.|1
"Allegedly the ""true story"" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same who funded Columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke Philip of Austria, known as ""The Handsome"" (and played in a rather unispired manner by Italian hunk Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). This is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. It drips destructive lust from start to finish."|1
i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap , thinking it would be a typical , crap straight - to - video monster junk film . all i got were movies that look like they have been made in hollywood , but there is no way i want to watch something like this on my vacation . i mean , it 's so stupid . i really wanted to put the movie on the tv and leave it alone , but alas , i could n't do that . the more i looked at the screen , the more i realized just how bad this movie was .|0
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?|1
Well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's.|1
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram. What a come down from Fox values and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox films. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan calmly walks across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter along, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown.|1
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based purely on Flex being in this movie. I have never seen him in anything not worth while. True to form this movie delivered for me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie a lot. I didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should have detailed.|1
why is n ' t this movie on the bottom 100 ? raptor is , without a doubt , the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life ! and that 's saying an awful lot ... i never liked this movie ! so what do we know about this movie or how many times we should watch it ? well , if you had to watch this movie , let me make it clear that every movie that has come out since 1979 can only be classified as something that did not exist for a single moment . there are no rules to restrict its production because there is no time to waste .|0
the pace of this movie is quite slow . it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china ( i am really starting to get annoyed with the films ) . however , in order to do this , we will have to make a stop at the same store on the way to the theater . when we are through with the checkout , we will come back to the car for a little bit . then the film begins to move into action . there were two movies available : the old and the young - the first was one of the last movies that i bought .|0
"(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, ""Where Do I Go? "", ""Easy to be Hard"", and ""Black Boys/White Boys"". While I have not seen the stage musical, I think that it clouds the judgement of many. This is not the musical you see in theatres. Do not attempt to compare them."|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy.|1
"` ` i remember waiting to be born . . . ' ' ` ` vision quest that was the american west . ' ' ` ` what did you go through ? ' ` and the film was good . i saw one of my favorite films when i was little , and i looked forward to seeing it again . the first time was in a movie . "" "" well , that 's great ! i mean , if you had seen it with my eyes , you would have been disgusted . but the first thing you should know about the film is that it was basically a waste of time ."|0
First, what is really great about this movie: - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - Horrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - Very annoying character Melissa.|1
This film is bad. Not so bad it is good. Just bad. It is however hilariously bad. I watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other Chuck Norris film ever again. If you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).It is a constant depression to me, as I grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10.|1
"OK, so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? ""SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH"". I thinking it has to be an older horror movie, because there's noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after The blockbuster hit ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original. That alone should have stopped me from putting it into the V.C.R."|1
"This film is great! Being a fan of ""The Comic Strip Presents..."" I just knew I would love this film. And love it I do. I finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. However I was annoyed to find that it had been cut! So I'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked!"|1
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd.|1
the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece . the first sequel , jailhouse 41 , was not so bad . it has been well - written and well - presented . i have to admit the movie is a great cover . i think i like this book a little too much for my own liking . i know that in the last few weeks we have been working hard to come up with more film than we have done in a long time . we are really good at this . most of the characters are completely ignorant ; even the dialogue is terrible .|0
To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES.|1
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you.|1
satya was excellent . . . . company was just as good but more polished , probably owing to the money earned from all of the work i 've done with this project . although i had no interest in it , i found the premise fascinating and decided to try it out . you know , there have been some horrible moments in my life . i wanted so badly for my son to go to his home state university and become a doctor , to live a normal life . but what would he say if he were to come back here instead ?|0
i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left with no hope of getting an answer . i could n't help but have a feeling that this one is much better . i mean , it 's not like i am going to find out about the movie later . i have been working hard to finish this film , so you can understand why i might feel a little apprehensive about doing this . actually , i do not know why i am even looking forward to this at all !|0
I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered the whole time through. I am not Asian but was still greatly offended by this film. The film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (Rex Harrison isn't even Asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention given to Biography of Anna. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner.|1
"I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about ""Dinosaurs eat people."" However, it was disappointing even on that level.For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly ""enough"" dinosaurs."|1
it takes an eternity for this typically over - simplistic and idiotic stephen king - based film to finally get out of the starting gate . there is no reason why it was made in the first place , let alone the last . i should also say that many of the characters have been read and they were most certainly not selected for the plot . this movie is definitely not a comedy . the character is obviously very good , but it appears that the actor is much more involved in his efforts to be a successful actor than the original had been . the plot is lame .|0
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars.|1
after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon , i could n ' t quite figure out why so many people came here from all over the place to watch . maybe it was because it was an amusement park and one had to watch movies that were ridiculous . i can never decide if this is because there are too many or if it is because there is too much going on in the movie / horror film genre ( which is kind of hard to come up with ) . but either way , i always felt as though i was watching a bad movie rather than being watched by someone else .|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. I wasted enough time myself watching it, so I will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. The Cavern is one of those.|1
. . . . is where i ' m assuming this movie came from . i mean , i ' ve watched plenty of b movies in my life , but when i saw that one , i had to look it up . not only was it a nice movie , it was fun . the character was really kind of cute , and it went well with the plot . even though the movie was not great , it had a happy ending . the first thing i noticed when i sat down at the dinner table was the overall quality of the acting .|0
i cant believe it ! i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has a great plot with lots of cute plots and a nice storyline . but , you can see how it could not be done properly . there were too many twists to get the story into any real order . the first couple of months were pretty lousy , especially as we were constantly having to go to the movies . the other night i was up at 5 am and trying to get some work done when i decided that i should try to do some research on the internet before i slept .|0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company.|1
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film, so I can't really describe how great it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. Then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. YOU JUST CAN'T miss. I mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This film comes on. You watch it and are shocked. It is so brilliant, so original it is so GREAT.|1
As a parent of two girls(14 and 11) I have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake/Josh, Zac/Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work, paying utility,rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets,etc.|1
"I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies I've ever seen. But the makers of ""Overnight"" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's Boondock Saints even about?"|1
in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash ! ! ! ! i am not a fan of film that can be played as a joke by a person or woman but this is definitely no joke at all . it looks like there has never been anything else like this to come from such a great movie . i really do have some ideas for this film and they are very entertaining . first , i think maybe we can try to find some reason why someone would use this to commit murder against his family .|0
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity.|1
this movie is so predictable when you know the modern american dream : do nothing , be a loser and leave your life . if i 'm not mistaken , this movie was made during the late 1800 's and is one of the biggest in the world . the acting is bad as in most film films that make it sound like it is going to last forever . i just wanted to hear what would happen next . i think i have already read all the reviews . it was really awful , but i had no interest in it .|0
david cronenberg ' s ` existenz ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism . it addresses the need to believe that we are all on the same planet , and that everything we see and hear is true . as a man who has been brought into this world with nothing more than the ability to view himself as an observer , he may experience some of the worst moments in his life . but i must say that my son was a good example . when i first came back to hollywood , i was hoping to go to work at a video studio .|0
Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. This is one of those films. Of course I can't help that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. I suppose we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot.|1
i had the privilege of being one of the still photographers on the set of ` ` grand champion ' ' and so i took some pictures . at one point i thought this was just a great opportunity for me to be one of the best people in the country but it turns out that i was not . after i finished my photo shoots , i went back to the beach house to get something to eat . i could n't have done this without the camera . it was the worst experience of my life . i remember watching the whole thing and feeling sorry for myself .|0
"Awful, awful, awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy ""Biggest Loser"" is. Picture this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with IQs in the 3-digit area WANT TO WATCH? Everything drags on forever, with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care?"|1
this is another of robert altman ' s underrated films ( let ' s be honest , the only movie he ' s ever made in his entire career ) . there are all kinds of scary scenes where he ' s walking down a dirt track with an ax ready to chop off someone ' s head . it ' s pretty funny and some of what he says comes out sounding sort of cheesy . as you ' re watching this scene , i would like to ask you if you had something that you were really interested in doing .|0
i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand . what i found was a badly scripted and cheesy comedy . the acting was not as bad as the others and the plot was not bad , either . but it was lame . the only thing that really made me hate the movie was the actors . we had no idea they could even have any good ideas about film . i ca n't help but wonder how many times in my life someone is forced to watch an old movie that is supposed to be popular with the population of the entire country .|0
"I used to think that it couldn't get worse that ""Army of the Dead"" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like ""The Godfather""!! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes the acting, put it this way, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, when compared to these D-List (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses."|1
i just got back from ` ` ags ' ' . after seeing it , i ' m convinced that no matter how hard i try to get it to come to my attention , every time i try to find some way to explain the film or even to convince myself that this was all a bad joke , it does not make any sense . so there you have it . one of the best things about being an actor is that whenever i look at the script , i always see something that makes sense . well , as far as i can determine , this movie is a little lame .|0
"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their ""Silly Symphonies"" series, ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog)."|1
this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet , mishima . it jumps around in time and time again and then dies off . but i think there is no end to the number of characters that have lived in these pages for more than fifteen thousand years . at the age of sixteen we could have spent the rest of our lives reading all of these books . it is very nice to know that when you get old you are still able to listen to all the songs of the world with one ear on the sound - aids .|0
"Let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...I mean a ""truly"" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. I admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And although I'm giving this film a 1, I highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: Aussie Park Boyz."|1
tom stern and jeremy slate are swing bachelor ' s planning to hijack a casino , ala ` ` ocean ' s 11 . the only thing i do not see in the movie is that it is supposed to be scary but instead this is very humorous . i can just imagine being in the room of this guy as he makes a lot of money at some high end casino on the north shore . why did they make that movie so bad ? what about all those people going off the reservation to kill their own children , or try to kill someone else if they decide to go there themselves ?|0
"I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I'm having a hard time describing these shorts. Let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. They stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled ""Pizza"" in which they use one very well."|1
A snore gore. I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (Now the famous Crobar Night-club)on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three buddies and I laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. The theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. They didn't miss a darn thing. The Worst acting ever.These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema.|1
this movie was physically painful to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger ) it was totally lacking in fun and romance . however , at the beginning i had a feeling that it would have been even better if it had been a little bit funny . but it was really not . it just seemed so dull . for all of the comedy and action , it is not as bad as some of the other films are . when you are reading the film or watching the dvd you might actually be able to see what others are thinking .|0
"You know, before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, ""they must have been guilty"" I reasoned?I formed this opinion over some years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He would ""bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be ""back on the street by noon""."|1
time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent . the plot has taken an unexpected turn into a rather unpleasant experience . as you could tell , there is something else out there that does not make any sense . i think it 's only because this movie was made in 1974 that we have seen so many films . at least , most of them did . it was just a bunch of people getting drunk , trying to get laid , and hoping to catch some bad guy ( who they did n't actually catch ) .|0
"I'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie:#1 Angelina Jolie sex scene #2 Foley artist outdid themselves #3 plot was quite thick #4 DVD does includes trailers and chapter stops#5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie #6 homages to blade runner through out the film #7 burning trash cans #8 funny guy with no legs #9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the film. #10 Sage advise, for example ""When you dine with the devil bring a long spoon""."|1
loved this movie ! kicking it old school ! love the idea . love the script . love the characters . it was good , but also creepy . how could i agree with this ? i would never have allowed myself to look at this movie if he had shown it to me . his face was so close to mine . it made my heart ache just thinking about watching it . i would rather watch an action movie right now , than watch anything remotely funny . there is really nothing like seeing a man being murdered and then hearing your lover tell you to go home for christmas .|0
I, like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way  from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral  when it did occur. Nighy/Victor and Sheen/Lucian: Perfect. Now, what did not (and there is plenty).|1
just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good ! ! ! thought it was a lot of work - and quite boring , as well - but it was fun . i really enjoy watching the film because i think i might have enjoyed having it on my own . ) i got an extra $ 10 from the first episode , so i decided to go to the cinema in the middle of the day . i made it back there in one piece and left about 5 minutes before anyone could come to see me . i would not have missed the show if i had seen it myself .|0
this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain - top commune as free men in search of escape . they find it hard to believe there are other places in the world where slaves can live or die . that 's a big part of the problem , but you have to accept it is also a big part of the problem because it leads to nothing good . the main problem is that many of the movies are really boring . i just ca n't imagine being able to make much money on this film . why would anyone even think to try ?|0
i ' ve been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago . in fact , i ' ll be taking it over a month hence if they do n't give me one hell of an excuse to show my face on television again . i don ' t care what you think of me or who i am ; i don ' t care about anyone else . this movie is way too boring . i would love to just sit around watching and wait for someone to pick up my phone and send me an annoying text saying why are you being so dumb ?|0
this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its author . for those who think i 'm making an attempt at humor , i am not . i actually found the novel more interesting than any other story i have ever been forced to edit . i thought that it would make me feel better if i got to watch a movie in a way that was nice . but i did n't . while it may have been good to see some action , it also had nothing to do with how you felt about them or how much you hated them .|0
This movie was outright painful for me to watch. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. First off, jump cuts. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. Secondly, the dialog.|1
In my opinion the directing, editing, lighting, and acting(minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. I wasn't expecting much, in way of camera angles, sound, etc, but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all.After seeing the film, I personally felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another. And I felt like the Travis(Franco) character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after Terri commits suicide.|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. However, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film. One well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing.|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most over all. I mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. It's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. Just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game!|1
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.He wrote this, I swear.With Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and makes it in to a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay.|1
enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will ' s ` ` genius ' ' is concerned . not just in math - - which is a little boring ) , but also with the music and movies . as for the films themselves , no matter what they were written on , i would have preferred it if they made them up . at least this way i can say that i was more impressed when we first saw them . i watched them twice last night , and there were even a lot of them , so i should have known why the film was taken .|0
Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this film. It begins promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the U.S., this is NOT it.|1
jennifer montgomery ' s ` ` art for teachers of children ' ' is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . montgomery ' s gritty style is based on the premise of a movie which has been going around for almost two years and still shows no real talent . in fact , i would be more inclined to agree with this idea if i didn ' t remember that it was an action flick and there was something wrong with the cast . don ' t let the tv show you re watching get your hackles up and make them jump up and down .|0
Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. But in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects. The blood effects are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives, this runs kind of like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?)|1
` ` hoppity goes to town ' ' was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave . i can make a decent documentary on them if you want it to be a complete failure . the first half is a bit boring . it takes me awhile to understand what it is about , but i do like it . i think my parents have a great deal of fun when they get together . we spend our days in front of the television , eating dinner and watching tv shows that are pretty good . then once the movies start coming on , it starts to get boring .|0
the st . francisville experiment claims ` ` this ai n ' t no walk in the woods ' ' , a direct slap in the face to his father : ' i was your mother ! it 's true ; you and i are still young ' and that is exactly what he thought . he did wonder why some teenagers were trying to get their hands on cocaine and others were trying to get their hands on guns . he always thought that maybe they really would like to kill him . but then again , how many times has he gone to church with his dad as a kid ?|0
Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX.|1
omg what has disney done lately . . most of their new shows really suck . suite life of zach and jenn are not too bad either . i hope to see them soon and they can all help each other . it would be good if we could get together again but that would take a couple of days since i have my own work to do for the show . oh , here 's what i want you to do tonight . go over to his house and try to convince him to come out with you guys . tell him how sorry you are .|0
last year , i fell in love with the tim burton ' s version of sweeney todd so i wanted to get together as much as possible before i go on stage . a lot of movies do have special effects ; however this one does not . when it first appeared , it went well and had a great cast ( even if it looked like they were being used by the director ) . it got really interesting as it followed the series of bad reviews from the publisher . the only problem was that most of the time , the story was n't funny at all .|0
see dick work . see jane work . dick and jane are married . they are successful . they have a son . they have a nice house . they are perfect for the marriage . so how did this happen to be about jane ? well , i am going to tell you one thing . it will sound weird . but i can say with complete conviction that this is a story that i never had the opportunity to read in any genre . it just was not my thing . i would have loved to read it in the early days of the trilogy .|0
if this movie would have been in english , all critics would have trashed it . the language is extremely good and the characters are well received . i just like to think of this novel as one of those ' bad movies ' which can take you back to a place where you were not meant to come from . however , i could n't let this play out too far because the main plot was such a complete crap film . i am not proud of this movie ; i hope you do n't regret coming along on this trip .|0
(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction.|1
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched. How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. We have an expression here in the U.K. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly.|1
If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity.|1
Dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS!!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. Due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. No one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. This should be a crime and.... I cant believe you would ruin a book like that.|1
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.From the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events I've ever seen in a film. It would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life.|1
koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film i ' ve ever seen . it ' s a masterpiece where everything is at the bottom of the food chain and the only problem is there is nothing to do with eating . i spent a good portion of the day in front of the tv watching that movie . i really enjoyed watching it , but was just too embarrassed to say anything since my dad would have been disappointed . instead , i settled on listening to the tape from the box . it was about two or three hours long and boring .|0
' be with me ' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie . just leave it running in the background . chat on the big screen for two minutes every day so i can watch my own comedy . all of a sudden , you have to find a way to turn the damn thing off or it 'll go out of business . i 'm trying to make fun of this movie and it looks like it works . i was thinking that it would be a good idea to rewrite the picture from the beginning but i ca n't bring myself to do it .|0
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions.|1
one of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time . anthony hopkins belittles himself by making such outrageous jokes . he also is a horrible actor ( and i have no idea who he is ) but in his movie he gets really good reviews . i loved that movie because i was actually able to pay attention to the dialogue . i spent hours looking at some of the most boring acting scenes . there were n't any characters that looked like they were actors or film directors . it was hard to watch when you were watching your favourite movie .|0
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.The first one, which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic.|1
Not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.While the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn't help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better.|1
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. The odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. Supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.It is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied.|1
` ` mr . bean ' ' , starring the legendary rowan atkinson , was a huge hit during its run in the 1930 - ' 80s . i ca n't figure how anyone could live through this . you never really get used to it because no one understands what it 's like to live with this kind of an episode on the radio . i think there is something seriously wrong with this movie , especially when it involves a beautiful young woman who falls in love with someone else and then has them kidnapped and taken to another town .|0
"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen."|1
"Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to horn in on Chaplin's action after the studio head hollers, ""Next!"" Chaplin manages to walk in over Turpin, however. Charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a big break, but will a star be born? There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving slapstick from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight."|1
I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol' Blue Eyes. However, I've never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing. Well...it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine, who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band.|1
blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle ( kristin erickson ) is found wandering in search of her daughter . unfortunately , she ends up spending most of the weekend with two teenage girls who end up doing terrible things to each other . they do have a bad reputation though ; both of them were murdered in the bar of the cabin , so we just have to hope that there will be no record of the murders . if not , i shall try to stay out of the slasher movie as best i can without getting myself in more trouble than i already am .|0
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.|1
stealing is a crime , and these guys , kenny yakkel and corbin bernsen look like their going to get the best of me . i could be wrong about this but i would n't be . i am on my second coke and it just makes no sense to me how this is happening . i have never actually been hit by a gun before in my life and i really thought i was safe at home . i saw this movie with a few kids who got hit by a truck during one of those bad movies that make you want to jump for cover .|0
superb editing , outstanding acting , especially by epatha merkerson , and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack . this film reaches the very top . i have not seen a lot of movies in my life so i thought this one would be a breeze . however , i know it wo n't ever come close to coming up with any other good movies than this one . i just hope the people who wrote this were willing to put on a show that will make the rest of the world forget how to see stars . this is the first time i have ever seen an actor like this .|0
"if you have seen the telugu version of gilli ` ` okkadu ' ' you will find this to be very similar . . . yes , there are some interesting pictures and stories in this story . it is an excellent story which seems to help me to get a little more out of the storyline as i go along . my readers like the characters and the plot but they don "" t want to see the character die out because they "" d rather not watch it at all - so i thought it might be interesting to watch it while i am here ."|0
"This is my first ""awful"" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator. ""Hell Ride"", directed, written by and starring Larry ""Friend of QT"" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged."|1
"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on ""Mystery Science Theater"" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the ""MST"" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that ""The Girl in Lover's Lane"" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1.The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting."|1
****SPOILER ALERT**** My boyfriend, some friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We sort of knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints?|1
"The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a ""pod"" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film."|1
I tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't sit well with me. Although the performances are good, the writing isn't. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we're supposed to side with Casey, given that she's the protagonist, but I don't find her at all likable. The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable.|1
"Though it's better than most made-for-TV movies, ""Buried Alive"" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. There are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. The ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.The acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, as always, but Tim Matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"". Don't bother with this one."|1
anyone that is looking for an episode of ` ` law and order ' ' or ` ` csi ' ' would have to be a real nerd to get into this place . if you go through the motions of helping people but you do it with something akin to reverence , it makes no sense . i could n't put my finger on what was different about this movie . it was so boring . the film did n't seem very exciting . when it first started out as a movie , there had been some nice things about it , like its quality in the last few episodes .|0
i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the movies i usually watched . i guess this was because my reading was n't as good as it had once been . unfortunately , this is not to say that there have been any negative reviews of the movie . we saw two very nice films involving people who died in a plane crash . neither of these movies was what i was hoping for . when you spend most of your life watching bad movies , you will take an extreme dislike to them .|0
* * spoilers * * i rented ` ` tesis ' ' ( or ` ` thesis ' ' in english ) on the way over here . it is a classic example of the type of film that was made in 1936 . and for all you know , this is just another one of those shows where you get bored and decide there are too many things to watch . i mean , they 're just so dumb , but even if you wanted to watch this , you would see that these films were so stupid , no one cares about them .|0
` ` yagyu ichizoku no inbo ' ' ( let ' s just say ` ` the shogun ' s samurai ' ' ) is somewhere between a film and a thriller . however , i 'm not sure if it ' s appropriate for a movie to be broadcast at all . one thing i notice that happens when you get on stage is that everyone around you is too excited to even watch the show . of course , since it ' s going to be a comedy , it doesn ' t really matter if you are paying attention .|0
` ` 2001 : a space odyssey ' ' is set in 2001 and the main character is hal . a computer graphics artist was hired to create this movie and it seems to make him happy , particularly if he contributes to the production of it . i do n't see why they want to film it , since it does n't have a feature film that shows anything at all but the people who are responsible for making it . they just need to put up with it because it makes them feel better about what 's going on in the world around them .|0
I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987.|1
This movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain (the breather), a female Batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. Not by any means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing.|1
This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced.|1
cheap , gloriously bad cheese from the 80 ' s , the decade of cheese . i watched this one first hand because it really had something to offer . you can only imagine what a documentary like this was like , if you were allowed to watch it at all . the premise of this film was that there are two things about cheese that people should know about before making their films . first , and most important : it 's better to have cheese than a movie that is too cheesy to make any difference . second , why does the movie have to take so much effort to create ?|0
a savage , undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival . he suddenly notices a hole in the film . he can not tell who or what made the film , although he is sure that it was taken in 1956 , from 1915 to 1960 . the acting is excellent , though the quality is abysmal . there is nothing to say about the main character , and the theme of the show is totally devoid of emotion . the dialogue is slow and repetitive , and at first he thinks this is just dumb luck . but when he finally finds his voice again , it is all wrong .|0
happy 25th birthday to valley girl ! great soundtrack , plausible story , wonderful performances . . . captures the spirit of the audience . this was a great day ! . . i want it to stay good even if i ca n't get it through my mind . . . . i just hope you were able to enjoy it , because i am dying to go to the movie and see it again , and there is nothing else i would like more than to watch the whole thing again in the very near future . . . so who 's in charge here ?|0
the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman . she gave her rather thankless show to several stars of the game and made this one even better . i would like to say that i have read a number of great movies over the last couple years , as it was one of my most favorite . i am not much of an actor , however i could tell by the way natalie portman performed her act that she had talent . if you enjoyed this movie , please sign up for my mailing list and we will meet up again soon .|0
now , lissen you guys , i loved this film , though not quite as much as farewell to the man i left behind . i wish you would have seen it with a more realistic perspective . anyway , the story went on for far too long . i was so depressed that i got up and made some lame excuse about leaving my house to get something to eat . they all laughed at me , called me crazy , and started talking about how they were thinking of selling the house . what kind of sick people would do such a thing ?|0
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville, FL, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order.|1
oh f * cking hell , where should i start . . . first of all ; this show is just another big joke . there are a lot of dumb stunts in it , most of them pretty good , and not a single one makes any sense . why do the people want to go to such stupid shows ? because that 's the way it looks at the movies . you can watch as many as ten different bands for a few hours every day , then they will leave your house and have no idea how much longer you can stand the torture of sitting through an hour of their time .|0
this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent . the whole plot is extremely forced - especially the part where the story is about a man who is kidnapped and imprisoned by a terrorist group , whom they suspect is going to kill him . it is not something that i have seen on tv . however , when i look at these movies , i find myself having an overwhelming urge to know what the real characters are doing in other scenes . i am sure that my imagination is running wild . this film is quite different from anything i have ever seen or heard of anywhere else .|0
"this movie is funny in more ways than one . it ' s got action . it ' s got humour . i just didn ' t know it until this year . 
 "" and if i were you , i don ' t think i would take it seriously . maybe some kids would be a good actor . there ' s a lot of plot and plot involved . the plot has to be good . the characters are pretty stupid . they have no idea how to act . they ' re so clueless about what they do , they ' re just thinking that they ' re acting like adults ."|0
watched the director ' s cut last night . . . glad it was free rental , even a dollar would have been more fun . when you can see the director ' s cut , you don ' t need to look at the film . it ' s not much bigger than your average television movie ; no one could really believe they were filming this . it is just as i expected of such a production . i am amazed that someone who has spent nearly 3 years in prison could be so cruel and mean to a person on television .|0
"this movie is so bad and hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great . nothing is good bloodline . . . but not much else . "" i had a sudden urge to smack myself in the head as i tried to remember exactly how long we had been on stage . "" i do n't suppose there was any way of telling which one of you actually went through with the movie ? "" asked dawsley . he looked at his hands and felt embarrassed about it . 
 "" that would depend on what type of acting you were involved in , or who you really were ."|0
spoilers a jewish frodo ? yep , that ' ll be elijah wood again . ever since the concluding part of ` ` lord byron ' i was wondering what this story could possibly be about . but i ' ve seen the movie before and know that this film is so bad i really don ' t have the heart to watch it . the main character is a tall , thin , dark - haired girl with a big nose and a mean expression . when she gets mad she literally throws herself on the table in front of a group of people and yells at them to calm down and talk to her .|0
the sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading , the male playing . there is no way a man can do it . i mean , it 's not so much the sex that gets to you , but how you want it to be . as if you have any chance of doing this and actually living your life , and not being killed or maimed at every turn . the only thing that makes this film interesting is what is written in this book . for example , it seems that this movie has been a very popular one throughout most of its years .|0
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie.|1
the most vivid portrait of small - town oddity i ' ve seen in a long time - and i ' m not just talking about the movie . i mean , what were you thinking going on this date ? where did you get this film from ? who made it ? why is this so horrible ? how can i possibly enjoy this movie if i have to sit through three times as many crappy movies as this thing ? ugh , i really don ' t want to watch this but i ' ll bet it has to do with sex .|0
if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris , more shallow than the world of the five stars , you get that . in my case , maybe i was getting a little too cocky and overly cynical for the first few days , because it seemed to me that the movie did seem to go on for a while , and then it was over . i never expected any of the characters at all to be so dumb as to come into our movie and try to make it better , but that does n't really stop them .|0
so , it ' s friday night and you want to go watch a movie . . . all you want is something to talk about , something to do , but i could ' t find a good movie . my favorite movies are comedies that are the stuff of horror films , but the main thing that has me worried is whether or not this film is even based on anything remotely close to a reality movie . i feel like i just got out of jail for murdering a woman and her son . i mean , how am i supposed to know if it was true ?|0
"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes? ""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash."|1
the box to this movie totally misrepresents itself . the cover shows a view of legs & panties in a pair of sexy , low - cut tops . then on the top section are scenes that make some people uncomfortable . the scene where the owner gets an eyeful is really gross . it makes you wonder why anyone would care what happens to a little girl who looks like they just rolled out of bed for a week . i ca n't think of a more disturbing and embarrassing scenario . not to mention , if you 're thinking about making a film with a woman , go ahead .|0
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When its over you say to you self ""huh? that's it?!?"". This is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?Its too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute."|1
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened & you will too. It's a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.|1
as someone who has read all of baroness orczy ' s books and seen most of the movies based on them , she was not impressed with any of their ideas . in fact , i felt a bit like a new kid at school . no matter what anyone says about me , that ' s the only way i ' m ever going to get my job back ! this is just so gross ! why does this happen every movie ? i thought you were trying to figure it out ! i never wanted to see this movie , but i couldn ' t resist watching it .|0
okay . . . for the most part , and all its cheesiness , this movie was actually pretty good for an old movie ; i just did n't get to watch it quite that well . i am very much in the mood to watch it myself , but you can never be too sure about people who make films like this . if they really want to do something with their money , then let them play a different game . i mean , we have no reason to believe anything is wrong with us . when we are alone in a room , we spend our time being bored .|0
i ' m not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been put in my hands . cm : yes , ok . ok . one more question though . how do you know the story ? and what is the story about these three people ? it looks like they were all married at one time or another and had a life together . this was a pretty big deal when i first read this movie , but it ' s too small to hold an entire lifetime of love and romance with only a few short episodes .|0
Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out. First: The part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower!!! (I laughed so hard! )Second: The part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor. He seemed like a pro diving in, but as expected, he couldn't swim (proper at least^^).|1
this film was really terrible . however , it ' s worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex show . i think that is what has made the story so much more interesting to me in the first place . the scene itself is so long that i can barely put two words into it ( not a bad plot ) . when it came out of the main character ' s mouth he didn ' t even seem to care how he did it , and i couldn ' t make him pay attention either .|0
the prey has an interesting history , unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of 1984 and july of 1985 . here , this story has a very good beginning , which i have enjoyed for a while because i loved watching it in its entirety . one that i enjoyed as well is the part where the author shows his love for a young lady who is looking for her parents to meet her . there is a strong possibility that this could even be true . the relationship with this woman is so different from anything that i have experienced on earth that i am still amazed .|0
oh , my . oh , this is a * really * bad movie . the acting is absolutely atrocious . one of the guys in the movie is an ass . i 'm so sorry i missed the entire scene and it 's totally over rated . well , i can not think of a more enjoyable film to watch . when the movie is over , let me know if you find anything else interesting on this screen . there is one thing i want to discuss with you before you leave for home . i was hoping that we could have a quiet night together , and then i 'd like to do some thinking .|0
What a dreadful movie. The effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. The acting was awful and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and run for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make Ms Green look to unfit).|1
They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.OK, the plot. Some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there are no more.Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent.|1
"Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call ""humor"". That this movie, and Moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can out-isolationist Charles Lindbergh."|1
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1  Cheap looking villains. 2  Perfectly timed one-liners. 3  Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4  The hero hooking up with the hot chick.|1
the other is a supposed ` ` horror ' ' movie made during the 1970s . it is not to be confused with some classic film , though i do have an opinion on one point of view in the book : the director was never good at anything . he did what he was told to do and he acted out his lines perfectly . it makes you wonder what kind of people are capable of acting like this . as a matter of fact , it makes me wonder why we ever thought we were being nice to any of them . none of us could even imagine doing something like this .|0
This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite.|1
"at first sight , i must say already , watch the contractor , 2007 . with wesley snipes too . he likes to play with explosives . if you do n't notice , this movie and the rest of his films are more than a little lacking in good acting . i remember one of these movies playing out on a large flat screen . there were a few others as well , mostly for the entertainment , but there were quite a lot of bad jokes that seemed to go along with it . i saw two of these so called "" comedic comedies "" because i thought they had some kind of plot or drama ."|0
"i thought this movie was perfect for little girls . it was about a magical place where genevieve and all her friends were saved from drowning when they were young . that is one of the things that got me hooked on this movie . i knew i needed to try it , but the idea just would n't leave my mouth . so what do you think ? "" "" oh yeah ! i love it , "" i exclaimed . "" it 's really good . i could see why these people are so willing to take a chance on this movie . how did you get to be so popular ? """|0
Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time.|1
"I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. ""one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)"", shocking"", and "" a must have "".Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting."|1
"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense."|1
oh , there are many worse wayne movies . this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element . you can probably tell it is bad because of the tone . it sounds like he was making some serious money from it ! i love these books , but sometimes i wonder if they have all been made out of actual money . what kind of person makes that kind of money ? how would you get rich with a bunch of money ? and how did this make the film so crappy ? i will not be able to leave my place in the theater without being seen by some of the critics .|0
the plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a y - chromosome - targeting virus , a ( non - human ) result is that this story is more of a joke than a comedy . so i want to thank everyone who saw this and were able to laugh . most of my characters are still out there somewhere in the universe . if it were up to us , they would have stayed where they were for at least 2 years . if they wanted to go on another adventure , they would have chosen something else .|0
"Once again Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. The fact that ""The Evil That Men Do"" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. One hopes this fine actor will rise again."|1
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but does include sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off screen.|1
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. Well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I don't really see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant.Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other great performances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II, and Hoosiers).|1
"Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows.Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining. ""The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog."|1
the title does n ' t make much sense to me . i ' m not sure what door in the movie should be left open , but there are some very good ideas in there and i wish they would have stayed shut for real . it ' s got a terrible plot that is totally out of character . i really wish i had an editor who was more involved in the plot , so i can write stories about the characters when they show up on tv . i do n't have time to watch this one , so i just leave it on the floor .|0
it is terrible ! it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told them there would be other people in this picture . if the movie had been seen by someone , it may have been able to predict this film . i think it was quite good but i can not say with any certainty whether i should take this film home or try to get it to one of my friends . i believe that they will be happy to see it at this particular time . i ca n't even tell you the story of when i first began reading the book .|0
"No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being ""naughty"" exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath."|1
wow ! it ' s hard to put into words my feelings for this episode . ice is one of the best flicks i can remember ever seeing . i had watched this three years ago , and it was a great show . the characters were awesome , there was an overall quality about them that you would not have even imagined . the plot was very easy to come across but the characters were just so bad . the main theme being the obvious fact that this movie should have been written earlier on the set rather than at the beginning . all of the characters are dumb and immature .|0
"ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in ` ` beware , my lovely , ' ' i have something wonderful to show you ' ? i think it would be really interesting if you did n't see the whole thing . do you happen to like this movie or not ? we are talking about a man from another time who lives in india and has a love affair with a woman he just met on a trip . this is the worst movie anyone has ever seen . it says : "" i will die for this !

Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn.|1
I watched this movie and all I can say is this...I am not a film student, nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don't understand. However, IF I were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...Yep! He's on drugs and I can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly?|1
no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the IMDB comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script IS terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace.|1
when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice , as my original intent was sold out . all i wanted to do was find and save the world . i was looking forward to seeing one of these movies . i think i would like to read that later . after reading about this movie , however , i came to the conclusion that there was no point in waiting for it to be re - produced . even if you have seen it at least twice , the premise has been too hard on people and they end up paying way too much attention to what they are watching .|0
unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie , i ' m really not the much of a cynthia rothrock fan , but when you ' re trying to find something bad about life it is often the same thing . and while that ' s true , it ' s almost always worse than the worst kind . i ' ve seen more bad movies in the last few weeks than i have in all the years i ' ve known my wife . the reason i do it is because i don ' t think i could make a good story if i wanted to .|0
"What I hoped for (or even expected) was the well known ""stop motion"" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. In short: The art of a) finding interesting Visual Events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. The stuff that made the other Qatsi's hits.I just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.Having watched the movie I got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping."|1
six months after high - school sprinter laura dies during a race , a killer begins to murder the rest of the team . all the teams are left in their spot as they attempt to finish the job at the last minute . this is not how things go down in the old west , but it has been done before and had to be done many times . i watched the show with horror , because what was left of the team were simply murdered in front of me ! the director said that if you kill someone you need to get rid of them first .|0
"i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two . there was n't one . instead i got an unexpected reaction . after seeing the film for what it is , i just said "" wow "" . i do n't see why you ca n't take a joke . but if you want something that you do n't have to look like you really know about it , i 'm all for it . maybe i am looking for a few extra minutes with this movie . in any case , i still think it is a little too close to the real thing ."|0
I realise it's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a Charleton Heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better.The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-Pharoh like. The acting really wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one.|1
i like arnold , and i love the subject matter , but this was a very disappointing movie . when one of my best friends mentions how she loves it , you just have to see the expression on the face in their eyes . well , that 's not entirely true ; there may be some good lines here , but you have to get your brain into gear or you are going to fall off the edge . i can assure you that this movie had some good points as well , but only for a short time .|0
i think ` ` category 6 : day of destruction ' ' was very unrealistic . the digital effects where like a movie in progress , only slightly more interesting than a tv show . and it gets even more stupid with the way people dress and do things . this is exactly what happened to the young men and women that went to vietnam . the problem here is that they did not come back home alive . they just got out of the war and ended up on base or at least as near to one as we could get without being blown up by the taliban or the army .|0
mr . kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts . what was he thinking ? this is a movie that should not be filmed in films of the worst sort and i want to see it . we sit at one of the most popular theatres in hollywood and watch it on the tv set . when kennedy starts shooting his movies , there is no way i wanted to see this one again . the director has just put a dvd into the player . as kennedy tries to have an idea of what kennedy is up to , you can see why he is so afraid of this film .|0
"The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French ""Emmanuelle 2."" This amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan/Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character, Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality."|1
while my kids enjoyed the movie ( and announced afterward that they want to buy it later ) i think i was more surprised than any other time i watched it . as an adult i was disappointed in my parenting choices . but now , watching this movie and reading all about it , i am beginning to like the characters . i also like the overall idea of having children . being a mother is really exciting , but i can see the whole concept has become somewhat out of step with the reality . what 's going on here ?|0
"the only reason i did n ' t delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it ! "" "" well , i still think this movie should be a crime to watch when you have such an expensive film for $ 1 , 000.00 ! it seems like nothing ever goes right in the movie . it does n't really seem worth watching so much and i would say that was the only way to get enough of it . i could see myself spending more than 50 bucks or less on this movie . this is a great movie ."|0
well , what can i say . what the f * * k ? there really is n ' t much to say that i 'm sorry . i am a dick and never have been in love with anyone , at least most of the time , until this one . it just happens to happen whenever i come to visit , like every year . we had a great time ; everything was perfect when we were living together . then things got ugly because i saw her again . the guy who broke her heart took her into the woods .|0
I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie, because she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There both really stupid and just terrible actors.|1
"Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the ""Toymaker's"" family. And, that's about it."|1
Once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, Hollywood pictures. Fast Forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. Now a hasbeen, Miss Lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(? ), Joan Crawford, and Bette Davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable Horror. But Flesh Feast? Really?|1
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart.|1
I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed dull to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor.|1
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War. The largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner, the East has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with Band of Brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind.|1
Although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. It's just that most of us looked to the X-Files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV.In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker.|1
I thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. Well I was totally wrong. There's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood film. They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? This is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.I thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original.|1
this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett ( a nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell ) piper . it is quite amusing , but unfortunately very sad . there is nothing that i can really add to this film that will make these films any better than their first blockbuster . they are obviously the worst movies on earth , and most of us do not agree with this ; however , none of us wants to lose sight of the whole premise . so instead of looking at the film as a joke , we just want to watch it for a few years to see how it turns out .|0
It's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.The cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout.|1
i would say this is a background movie . play it the background as your tending to busy work ( in which you have to be at least 40 ) and you will soon see some action . also play it the way it was , so you are not afraid to tell your own story . when you were little you did n't even know who the bad guy was . all of the actors were really pretty cute and the dialogue was good . but the main thing you have to remember is that these stories are not for kids . you can ' t even imagine what happened to them .|0
"i saw this originally on channel 4 ( uk ) and it was a fantastic film that left a great deal of the reader confused . i watched the first half of the movie as i sat down and tried to get my mind around what had just happened . it was one of those scenes where there are two men walking in the dark and someone walks up to them and asks , "" did you hear anything interesting ? "" the man is looking at his watch and starts laughing before he says , "" oh no . i 'm afraid not ."|0
Great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration.|1
I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure...|1
Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now!Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was acted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually.Over the years, I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would, by coincidence? Anyway, it's yet an old story. I saw it a short while ago.|1
i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case . judge and jury decided to let me pick the film based on the book , so in the end i did what i thought was best . that 's when i found out that the characters were not as good as the movies are supposed to be . i made a list of all the comedic errors they made , then i got into the acting role of one of them who could n't stand being away from her friends . i think he was jealous of me for taking over his life .|0
ok so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever . there is no spoken dialogue , nothing to say in any way that would make this look like a movie . i wish i could turn the television off , or at least flip on the tv and watch the film . if only it was really a movie , i might even be glad that i picked this movie ( after all ) . i am actually not a big fan of bad movies but i have had enough for one day . i think i will just close this book and put it in the trash .|0
"""First Snow"" has an intriguing beginning. A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. From this point on the movie plays out like a bloated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience."|1
This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil' Pimp must lay down for his homies.The animation isn't very good in this.|1
Frank Falenczyk: It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly.Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'You Kill Me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007.|1
monday , october 02 , 2006 so i got together with my dad as i always do . we ordered pizza and talked about the weather while we ate it . even though i am a huge fan of sports , i just can not bring myself to watch television . i really like watching this tv show , but i ca n't enjoy the show . i get along well with the actors but there is just something that is lacking . i thought you were going to give me some feedback on this film . i want to know if you found this movie in any way offensive .|0
a killer ( john karlen ) with a penchant for really bad disguises ( afro wig on a white dude is what you got to be scared of . ) and the first guy who ' s name comes up with this stupid plan that ' s supposed to help people . well it didn ' t seem to work . there are so many options i ' ve had since i ' m a kid in this town , but it ' s not one of my favorite parts at all . it ' s hard to make things any better when you are sitting in a chair .|0
The subject matter was good, direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major. The acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle.|1
"at least if you ' re a disney fanatic ( well , of the variety who loves their live - action films as much as i do ) you may not like the genre . this film was made when i was eight years old in 1971 . i was only eleven when the film was put together and i had just started watching it when i happened to see a movie called "" the love story "" . i was in my early 20s , and i was so fascinated by the movie that i really didn ' t understand the plot . while i liked it , i found it boring ."|0
when i first saw the trailer for this film , i really wanted to see it . i thought some people would just get off on the show being so good at making movies . i did n't even have a reason to go out and actually do something interesting . this movie had no real character . in fact i could only think of one person that was like this . my father is an actor . we were close to graduating school when we got together . well , if you can call it high school . dad 's acting is atrocious but he is a nice guy .|0
gordon scott with his well coiffed hair , hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all bad films . this film is based on a movie that you see when you are not watching the screen . i saw a film like this once while i was trying to do my homework in an empty house . i was looking at it and thinking what kind of movie would deserve to be filmed in a deserted barn in the middle of the country . there is a lot of funny stuff about the two people standing next to each other holding onto a hand - painted wooden ladder .|0
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. But, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town.|1
this movie is absolutely horrible ! i thought because it had good actors in it like gabrielle union , hill & appleton they were doing great . the main characters seem to have some real talent but their character is a total waste of time ! these people are so dumb and stupid ! they sound like morons . if you listen to all the movies they tell you when you first get on the show your life will be perfect . i hope that there will be enough left over to make you think about how much you appreciate the actors .|0
first off , the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i do n ' t understand how was such an enormous mistake made . at least for me it wasn ' t as bad as the movie itself , though i am not a very good actress . i could not get past the fact that everyone in hollywood knows about this film and is waiting for someone like me to show up . why would you think that ? there are a lot of things i hate more than being famous , but i love watching these movies .|0
"mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called ""wine except"" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin."|1
"I can get over the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a ""Masters of Horror"" flick.But, what I can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.To me it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington, and our heroes. I have family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the Arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH."|1
1st watched 4 / 30 / 2009 - 4 out of 10 ( dir - john waters ) : corny waters - like comedy musical with some funny jokes . but no one had any idea what the plot was , other than this movie was about a boy who lost his virginity to a girl he really liked and found himself in a weird relationship . that story is just plain gross . all of the horror movies featured a ' b ' rating . i did my homework on this one , as i have seen plenty of horror movies around the country .|0
Young, ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange happenings, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it's gets to be a little much.|1
I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't.|1
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show, me and everyone, that a DVD shouldn't be judged by it's cover. ***SPOILERS*** The film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) being too school-girlish to watch.|1
the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting , and i was really sold on the mother - daughter relationship . but then i realized that if both parents were to be judged by this film , my views would not be so different . i mean i knew that neither of them could do much about their sexuality , but what else can i say ? they did have one thing right . it was hard to understand how two people with such a high school experience could even be related . i just thought there must be something in it for them .|0
"Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over ""parody"" movie movies which I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs."|1
the other boleyn girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon . this is a good book ; very good , actually . i just love the characters ' personalities . there are some good scenes and i enjoy seeing them . i also like watching the action movies as much as i like listening to the drama of the storyline . i really liked all of the parts that made me think that this should be an action flick , rather than a sci fi thriller . still , the ending is pretty good . i found the whole scene to be somewhat disturbing .|0
This is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. Added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie.|1
i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show ' s ` ` contestants are . ' it ' s such a load of crap . there ' s not a good movie on that planet where a guy who doesn ' t have a job can still make money by doing nothing , much less doing everything . you ' re lucky to be in this program at all and even if you did , it wouldn ' t be worth watching this one . the problem is that no one has any sympathy or interest for these people . why ?|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help.|1
a vg brit rom - com , one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy . quirky and ridiculous , that movie was all i would have liked to watch . i had seen it too many times as a kid to remember how the plot was always messed around or where it really ended . there are only three movies in the whole series which i thought were good enough for me to watch . the first set of scenes is pretty stupid . the second set consisted of two men arguing over who should do what in a bar in san diego .|0
"It's complete nonsense. I've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the ""parallels"" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. It's crafted for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.Who made this hit peace? Easy.When all is said and done; Que Bono? That is, who benefits, in the long run?You don't. You sacrifice money and rights."|1
I'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse.|1
if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston , it also has a debt of gratitude to jules . i would be extremely proud to have you on my team someday , as well as this wonderful book . here is one of the finest stories in the anthology that i can find . i ca n't believe i 'm starting to like this story so much for such a little girl . oh , i was right . it 's a really great story and very funny , although it may not last long . i hope you enjoyed it because i thought it was going to be a real good first draft .|0
Where do I begin? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real.|1
"I can't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex--at least I think that's what it was about. The script made no sense at all, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera-work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to ""support African American films."""|1
this forth film in the ` ` angel guts ' ' saga , which at only a few minutes above an hour and a half it will be so full that you ca n't sleep . we do not like the movie when it has to be aired because it is such an unlikeable , bad movie . the first couple of scenes must have been terrible ; they are certainly not good enough to compare with the stories made by the author . after all , no one ever gets to finish the second installment before the first . this is a very bad movie .|0
i , being a fan of rupert grint , rented this film a few months ago . i thought it would be funny to see what would happen if i made some new friends . i did not care much for my current friends but i know this was a good thing for them . anyway , i got a great movie from a very interesting character and went ahead and gave it to the camera . so how can i possibly describe this movie as boring ? well , the only reason i like these movies is that they really do help me get over my initial anger towards my wife .|0
River's Edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters.|1
really ? is this necessary ? how can somebody make such a film ? disgusting ! ! ! seteven seagal ! what a waste ! ! she was a terrible actor ! i had to watch it all again and again . i could n't believe it ! ! the characters were horrendous and the actors were so bad that no matter what movies they played they seemed to be unable to take a single joke seriously . i tried hard not to get involved with the acting as well , but after seeing this movie for the first time and hearing the sound of it in my head i started to doubt my judgement .|0
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. A group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster.|1
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It kind of careens into 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be Pacino's protégé'. So he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. Does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think of.|1
Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane! '; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits.|1
this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals . one of the worst movie that has ever been made by a single person , it was basically a big plot hole . i could n't begin to tell you how bad the characters were . they were brutal . the characters were not good and there was so much wrong with them that my brain could not wrap itself around the meaning of any of them . no matter what i did in the movie , all i could do was see the end . the protagonist was an older lady who looked at least sixty years old .|0
"I rented this one by accident. I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ""shameless Blair Witch rip-off"". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. Boring Characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the Blair Witch Project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits."|1
"The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still ""bothered""."|1
I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team, as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well, we do get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable tales of family pains, generation gaps and fatherhood, in particular. But it's drama, thankfully, and what drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story could seriously carry a whole movie, if expanded separately.It's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed.|1
Okay it is terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. C'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman, and, my personal favourite, Roger Ready. Yes, B star John Agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a NASA experiment gone awry. The movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting.|1
very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad . this movie is a prime example of present day film production . i would n't expect it to be too bad , but that was all the audience wanted to see . you never can tell how good it will be if you pay close attention to the plot or the characters . it may be a nice enough story , but by now it has lost the appeal . the only good thing about this film is the fact that the script is almost identical to what is on tv .|0
"this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : ' ' quirky ' ' and obnoxious characters "" . there was one scene , however , where the actor is trying to be a good actor ( for example ) when it becomes too difficult . he attempts to pull himself up by his arm , but falls backwards on his ass . in this movie , the actor does n't even have an arm to pull himself up . instead , he is simply sitting there with his head down and his left hand hanging off the side of his head while his right hand watches the movie from a safe distance ."|0
"Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood's handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in ""Tarantula"" where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack."|1
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. He shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family. It is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would.|1
I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. Justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. If you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early Americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...I highly recommend this movie. Especially during atime of war and conflict in Iraq...when our American image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out.|1
"this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen . it is a tight slap in the face , and i wish there was some way i could take credit for it . "" "" are you joking ? "" i asked . "" it just does n't make sense . how could such a movie be worth millions if it had no money or interest at all ? that is a bad film . it is like being invited to an art festival , only without the entertainment . i ca n't say i 've been to many art conventions where i have watched anything remotely resembling art ."|0
You can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. We've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead.|1
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film is going to end.The premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.Uhh ..no.The main problem is this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz its boring!|1
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style.|1
an enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage of the story . even more so in this novel , which i have been looking forward to having for much longer , is what happened when it finally got into my mind that i am not going to see this movie in any more than 3 or 4 hours . if you want to read this book then please just check out the other titles on the shelf at the rear of the theater where the characters are sitting and there is no shortage of interesting material .|0
"The recent release of ""Mad Dog Morgan"" on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic DVD version. ""Mad Dog Morgan"" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia."|1
I don't understand why this movie was released, it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if an Aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad... boy was I wrong!If anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film.The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, it was the WORST acting in the HISTORY OF FILM.|1
"Computer savvy John Light (as John Elias) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon. But, Mr. Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to bed down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a naughty Internet sex session, Ms. Dodds shines Light on. He may lose is ""Digital Dreams"" Internet empire, too!"|1
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I have never seen such a cheesy film, but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction, and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins. Goodness they just don't get any better than this. Rush and buy this tape right away.|1
i rented this film out of the local video store one day , you know , the kind of movie that people watch about a thousand times over . i do n't even have to try to tell you what sort of movie it is . when i saw it , i just felt totally out of touch with my personality . i was on the wrong set for it , but i think i really made the right decision because the film was pretty good . it had a big plot - in the sense that there were four main characters .|0
First of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.But, I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion.|1
a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides . then again , are these really the same individuals that have killed over and over ? who are these ' victims ' ? i ca n't even begin to fathom their motive . is it merely for money ? revenge ? or something else entirely ? there is no way to tell whether these people were being tortured or murdered . they all have horrible looks on their faces , with mouths open and eyes bulging out . the only positive outcome from this murder is that most of the blood has drained away .|0
the mummy ' s curse is the last in the series of the kharis mummy films , and it seems that most of them have been very bad . at the time of this film , all i know about the author is that she has a good heart and is kind to others , as well as to herself . the only thing that strikes me as horribly off was the fact that she didn ' t seem to mind being seen by anyone but one person . i ' m not sure why she chose to take on this particular character . it just did n't seem right .|0
"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I can't see why. It's beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark"". The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows."|1
in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously . the movie is called arachina , which does not necessarily mean we will have to fight any of its creatures for it . however , it is funny how it is the only thing that makes sense . arachna and arachna ' s attack were so intense it was almost like they wanted to eat you alive . i would love to see such a spectacle . there really is no way to know what is going on at this place . i tried my best to watch the screen as much as possible .|0
"Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. Don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. This movie really stands out. ""Hair"" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. There is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music."|1
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. They sound like today's stats).|1
despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century , erwin rommel is generally well - regarded in this area . he was one of the greatest hollywood stars i 've seen in a long time . from what i can tell , he had some good things coming his way when he began writing his first movie and became a great producer . unfortunately , there are those who believe he did not succeed at everything else . i ca n't imagine how such a talented film could have come to be based on something as poorly made as this film .|0
This film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. However, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life, in particular the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8, and World Bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned.|1
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.|1
visually , this film is interesting . light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an overview of dialogue . these scenes are made up of several things : 1 . i have the impression that what i was doing was just part of it . 2 . if you want to see a scene where the actor acts like he is making a joke at the expense of the audience , come see me . i had a nice time getting to know this movie so i will recommend it to anyone who might like to watch it .|0
The most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful, cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could've saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is, they're better actors than this movie would have you believe.|1
"Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a couple of things. First, this film is nothing like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like it.I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the basic approach of the film maker is not ""surrealist"" per se. therefore its not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a weird Euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of ""wierd"" not surreal.Secondly, I think the music by Heuzenroeder is brilliant."|1
to keep it as simple as possible . this is a very good show . that is well written , but i ca n't help wondering who made this film . i mean , maybe it could just be a joke at first , but then the plot of the movie changes and eventually the whole story comes back to me , and i wonder if this is part of some comedy . no one really knows what this movie is about . not even the director . it makes sense though . i never read any of these books before .|0
this is almost ed wood territory . yeah , that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a spaceship or an airplane , and it 's not . at one point in time , many of the stories were based on something as common as a single piece of land being used as a landing site . there are no pictures to show the story , so i just keep guessing that this is part of the bad boys ' version . but when i saw this movie ( i mean , really watched it ) , i felt sorry for it . the original was a joke .|0
we are in a small town , a homely widow ( ida lupino ) hires a handyman ( robert ryan ) and the job is taken away . i have not had a great vacation in years but i will say i am looking forward to something like that . it has been over three years now since i was on my own and i have never felt this way before . i feel very lonely for a change . if only there was one person who wanted to talk about what i just witnessed , it would be me . after being alone for so long i did not know what to make of this movie .|0
i watched this movie with my mother . she is 81 yrs . old and was raised to be a bigot . she should have turned her back on the life she has created . what a waste of money it cost to do this . i guess i am just not much of a cinema person . anyway , you ca n't buy something without having seen it , but that does n't make me like it any less . let me explain why it is so boring in here : the story is based on the most obvious plot line . the characters are predictable .|0
Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.I know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a God. All great questions, But I really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed but come on.|1
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers.|1
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden, then we should take this stinker down to Gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. They'll be singing within minutes. Of course, I'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the Geneva Convention in several ways. Look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch TV at home. So take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little TV zombie. She got up and walked away after about ten minutes. That's how bad this is.|1
sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says ` ` stay away from this movie ' ' . we will not watch that movie . ' the worst thing i ever saw on tv was a show about it being a movie with monsters . there is no such thing as monsters and i have never seen a movie like that in my entire life . i am actually surprised that some of the people who know what they are watching are able to watch any movie at all , especially this one . i have seen several movies that featured werewolves , but really nothing like this .|0
in america , the jewish jonathan safran foer ( elijah wood ) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection . and a very interesting thing about this film : it is just so hard to get used to the fact that people have no idea that the book is there . however , i would not put it past someone to attempt to do something with it . if only they knew that their mother was also a serial killer , but instead , they are merely putting it off until the next year or so when the story starts to die down .|0
"i can not believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage ! the acting was so poor , my only reason for being here was to try and get an impression of some new movie . you see , i have seen a lot of tv movies since the beginning of this series , but they were just too crappy . first it was great , now it is lousy . i am so bored . i do n't expect to ever be in any of those movies again . "" why do i have to sit through these stupid films ? "" i said to myself over and over ."|0
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo-like madness.The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken.|1
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.Don't miss this movie.|1
oh dear ! what can i say about half past dead ? i was really disappointed in it . i had a feeling that this film might be good , even if the audience did not follow the script and pay too close attention to how it was performed . i also saw a lot of things that night that i would have preferred to avoid - which is saying something . i spent the rest of the day watching movies that made me feel depressed . by 5 o'clock p.m. , i just wanted to leave the movie and get home to my room .|0
watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of british screens . it showed a video of an attractive girl wearing a low - cut blouse and short shorts in a dimly lit room with the lights off . she was sitting on the edge of the bed , completely oblivious to everything around her . at the end , she had a small camera hanging from the ceiling so you could look up and see where she was watching . there were no sounds whatsoever . the light was turned down low enough for you to see that the girl was asleep .|0
A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. It could be set in any town in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well.Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.The actors are scarily believable, I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes.I loved the way this film was shot.Overall this film IS a must see.|1
Can't say this wasn't made well. At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. And there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is an oddly non-Hispanic film in the same way West Side Story was many years ago. Both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a sort of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself.|1
the characterization in this movie is among the worst i ' ve ever encountered . the dialogue is trite and cliche , the actors are plain dumb , the plot is dull and the plot is an utter failure . it sucks ! i just wish i had been able to do more about this movie because i would have liked to have seen it at the beginning . the first thing on my agenda for today is a quick shower , shave , and a cup of hot coffee . when i get dressed , i go over to mark 's house , which is one of the nicer properties around here .|0
although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , i feel certain that it has been taken on an entirely different track since then . but now that it is released , and with the sequel as a success , there is no doubt of its quality . the second half is even better than the first . they all play a similar type of game : to try to get into a character 's head - or maybe to get him to listen to a game about how to be a hero .|0
"saw this at the video store and thought i ' d give it a try . sounded like a good story , "" she said . "" how about if we meet up on thursday morning to talk about whatever happened ? that way you can get some sleep tonight . "" "" oh , yeah , sounds good . i ' ve been trying to make sense of all of this . when do i leave ? "" "" wednesday morning . why do n't you call and see what time he gets back from the movie . "" "" ok . i will let you know once i get there ."|0
the minutiae of what ' s involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all possible movies ever made . it has never failed before and it will not now , but it sure as hell is going to fail now . here are the most obvious clues : a serial killer and his accomplice - or so it appears . they were married and he was her father 's closest friend . some of the things we watch on tv can be seen by anyone who actually sees it . i had a good time on the set of this movie .|0
Do NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. It possibly is the worst movie I have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire.|1
"i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it , but mostly because the characters are so easy . "" there were lots of things that he did not like about this movie , but they all had one common thread to it : it was a horror movie . how much more do you want to read before you start eating your dinner ? i thought you could eat the whole damn thing if you wanted to watch what is going on . instead , you get nothing out of it . why am i in this movie ?"|0
is the cannes controversy - meter remarkably esoteric , or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never see what is actually going on ? who would believe it ? no one really believes anything about any of us , but when a reporter asks if there is a reason why people do not like to think , they always end up believing the worst . at times i was just so disgusted with this film that i found it very disturbing to watch it . yes , i know some of you may not believe it , but i am telling you this out of genuine belief .|0
I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid.|1
"First off, I'm a huge Bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. I watched every film he made on the big screen since ""Love and Bullets"", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood-blockbuster star.I kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latter films."|1
christian propaganda . . . lots of fear mongering . . . this is not scifi , this is chrifi ( christian fiction ) , or even anything like that at all . they just try it out with no success . there are a couple of good stories , and most of them end up being rubbish . the main thing we have in common is our lack of imagination . one time when i was a little kid , i had a very special nightmare . my mom came over to watch my favorite movie . i woke up feeling really depressed and then realized i had been asleep for too long .|0
the first of the italian rip - offs of the french soft porn blockbuster ( though it might be interesting to note , as this is not one of my favorites ) . i 've seen so many films that if i was to turn them back on and watch the movie from a close - up , i would n't have recognized anything out of the ordinary or even particularly good . i thought for sure it would be an american horror film , but when i entered the theater i saw two people sitting at a table playing with a wooden stick .|0
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough.|1
"""Disappointing"" is the best word I could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the US athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced.What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?"|1
i ' m not a movie snob . i ' ve liked lots of movies that critics hate , and i ' ve seen plenty of horror flicks that have gotten me interested in something really bad but never made me think that it would be such a great thing to do . for example , you can get a job anywhere ; you can make a million dollars on your own tv show , even put up with having no one to come home to . but if you try to make it look good by hiring an agent , then they are going to start putting you in the limelight as a hero .|0
i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather grahm on , who i liked very much but did n't like because it made me feel uncomfortable . that movie is so lame i do n't even need to look at it to figure out if it 's bad or good . the movie is so funny i had to laugh in the face of it . i know you love the movies , but really they just are not as entertaining as the ones i usually watch . my wife and i would love to get together sometime for a talk .|0
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen ""Dahmer"" (2002) I can say that following what the media put out about Jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. I have studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood."|1
"i ' d liked the takashi miike films i ' d seen so far , but i found this pretty disappointing . as the movie progressed , it was soon apparent to me that the characters were all in a mess . the plot of the film started out good - and then took on a bad quality . not much had happened during the previous movie , which did nothing to save the life of the protagonist . from what i could see about the character , there were no real problems . for example , the author of the first movie said he "" wouldn ' t let his kids die !

fred carpenter screened eddie monroe at boston college , and judging from the enthusiastic response , he has much to tell us . there is little doubt that this ' s one of his favorites . i was not in any kind of great spirits during our first two sessions , nor was i surprised when he left me shortly after we started talking about going to europe . i decided that i could do with a good book for the occasion . the movie was nothing like i had hoped for ; the premise seemed slightly more realistic than what i had expected .|0
"Movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. Sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. A light hearted ""golden years"" romantic comedy, Out To Sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs to be given a break. This is just good, light hearted fun. It's not meant to be a deep movie."|1
"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" could bring me back, so here I am.With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad."|1
Although it was dark, depressing, and at times hard to watch, You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. Her compelling and believable performance made the movie. It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute. Who knows.|1
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. Clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, Matt is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture.|1
i love dr who so much ! i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had . i just hope he is not a very bad actor ( or a very good doctor ) because i can not imagine being any better . i thought about going on some of his silly stories but i figured that if i am going to be around for this whole thing i would better enjoy what i get . it seems like such a stupid movie , you know ? and i did not even have to read one of them to know that i am dying here .|0
"it ' s about jealousy , it ' s about racism , it ' s about manipulation , but the underlying message is this : 
 "" i ' ve got a lot on my plate and i ' ll do anything at all to give you some peace of mind , if you ' re up for listening . i won ' t lie ; i have a lot to be thankful for , and it ' s something i want to experience in life again . i don ' t think anyone can tell that there ' s anything wrong with our society here ."|0
I never comment on a film, but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves.|1
this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la , who end up having their baby . what was the point of that ? they make no sense at all , and they spend most of their time hanging out together on campus trying to learn how to love each other . one day i went to her house to watch the movie . as soon as it started playing , i knew i wanted to see something different . after watching the movie , i had a feeling that she was going to be a wonderful mother .|0
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from series one, but by Jove it's worked.|1
"this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and all they do is swim around in their undies . so it gets really boring after only 10 minutes , and i am afraid that if i watch another one i might not like my film very much . anyway , here is the story : 
 today was the 10th of june 1932 , and the first person to show up at the office had an ill - fated plot that could have been played by any number of actors ."|0
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions.|1
_ the wild life _ has an obvious resemblance to _ fast times at ridgemont high _ , and _ the wild life _ comes up with a lot of weird stories and bizarre twists , but they all feel very much the same . i have seen this film over and over , yet it never gets published . no one ever reads it , or is interested in learning what it is about . it always sounds like there are a million people watching it for some reason - even if they do not want to look at it . my favorite character in this film ( bob ) is a boy named sam .|0
this is a entertaingly bad b - movie . actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies in this format and i have seen plenty of them in my life but this one is the worst . as a matter of fact , all of them are so bad i could n't write any new horror flick that did more than make a funny story come out at the start . the plot was crappy , the plot was not good and the characters were horrible . if you liked this film you might consider reading the novel and seeing how it came out .|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on watching this movie DON'T! I warn you... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically horrifying, not in the Horror movie kind of way, to watch. I mistook this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I had noticed I made a mistake I decided to watch this one anyway. I wish I wouldn't have. This movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent.|1
"A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on ""Dante's Inferno,"" there is nothing especially clever. Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art.I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked."|1
another sequel ! why on earth do they keep making these ? this has got to be the weakest ' franchise ' of the game ever ! if i have to choose , i would like to think that every player has an interesting story . the most exciting is the characters . the main reason we are having this movie is because it takes up half the screen . i am not exaggerating in the least about the plot . it is great and will make my job easy . you can see why i bought this series . i know how much your favorite book is going to come back to haunt you at some point .|0
they call this film ` ` euro trash horror ' ' . well , it ' s not horror . the film takes place in an american - style movie with nothing of real truth . and there were none . i don ' t have a lot of respect for the character of this film . i can ' t understand why this movie is treated to the way it is . even though it was based on something other than television , that film is really bad at its worst . you get the general idea of what it could have been if these two guys had just made out and then gone their separate ways .|0
as a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager , i tend to watch all sorts of stupid stuff . it is n't until after the film that i realize i have never seen an episode of the twilight zone . what a huge waste of time . you ca n't even find a television in a movie like that . if there were a show like that , it would be considered lame and unimaginative by most people . it is one of the few things i could enjoy watching - although i do n't care how many people watched it , i would rather watch something like this every day !|0
Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!|1
"The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of ""The War At Home,"" I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night, while flipping through channels, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it."|1
Once again, I've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this one's not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile.|1
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so I'll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit.|1
"This has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. The ""special effects"" ( Spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. I have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end."|1
"absolutely one of the worst movies i ' ve ever seen ! ` ` the beginning ' ' was not the greatest either , ' the end ' is terrible , and it ' s like a bad horror film . . . . "" chapter 10 
 by mid - afternoon on saturday , laura could see the white house building looming ahead in the distance , but no sign of its occupants . as they rode their motorcycles up hill to the entrance gate , she felt that there was an urgency to the whole experience . how far away could the president of the united states be at such a late hour ?"|0
"Thankfully you don't need a lot of ""book learnin"" to understand where this thing's going... Obviously a poverty row cash-in on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable George Zucco in another of his patented ""mad doctor"" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job."|1
this is a difficult movie to watch , and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the director was very good . in fact , he was better than anyone could ever hope for . it took me four years of trying to find the right words to convey to you what i saw and how much i loved him . when i finally found it , i gave it to my wife . she never understood why we did n't just do it on dvd . she thought it was because i ' d learned something from movies .|0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon.|1
* * * tip : have it read to you , heres how * * * 1 ) copy and re - finish the story by reading it . this should be easy enough but i was never very good at writing novels . i like the concept of being able to write a great story about a girl in a town on the border who goes into danger because someone she loves is dying . i can not say i 'm particularly proud of my work , but maybe that would make up for the fact that i do not get along well with anyone else .|0
"Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white, while they conveniently forget that both ""Clerks"" and ""Schindler's List"" were filmed in black & white and are great movies.Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black & white are the same people who wouldn't like ""Psycho"" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes."|1
Loki, Norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad.|1
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic.|1
"this is my first ` ` awful ' ' rating ever on imdb and i could n ' t think of a more deserving reason to take it seriously . i just do n't think the fact that we were there for so much effort was all part of some game . i really do not get why people keep coming up with this nonsense . even if they did believe in it , it would have been so easy to see through it . no one thought about putting their names in an unflattering order to save themselves the trouble of finding a movie that sounded like "" evil "" ."|0
the worst sequel i ' ve ever seen . really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films were , even worse than the original ones . but you ca n't have a soundtrack to be sure of how the movie will feel in your hands - and it is terrible . if you read this story , you already know what it is like to be with someone who has a love life so bad he does n't want anyone else to hear it . i ' m glad i never saw this one . there are so many people in that scene .|0
This fantasy was utter garbage. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, though.|1
"This is definitely a touching movie, and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle. The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book ""the origin of Species"" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion."|1
this film , for what it was set out to be , succeeded . it ' s a short tragic film that is almost as ugly on the big screen as it is in print and i have seen it quite a few times with my friends but there are some good places you can go and watch it here . i liked it when i watched it and i am very much like those people who like to make things up . they would tell you it ' s not too bad ; just wait until you actually read the script .|0
"This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. After the introduction where we are given the backstory of ""something"" killing a couple people in a farm house, We are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - AND NOTHING HAPPENS for a looooong time. Then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for a very long time. Then FINALLY the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. Then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends."|1
"someone says this anime could be offensive for girls . . . not really . embarrassing situations are funny ; first time for that , but i can see why people would love the movie .

you thought after ` ` traumschiff surprise ' ' that german comedy ca n ' t get worse ? it can . this comedy has been on tv since 1981 and is not the greatest comedy of its kind in the first place ! i have never seen any of these films ( or anything else ) and they seem to me like an example from one of the best comedies ever written . the fact that it was filmed here in my home world makes me wonder , how could it be that a guy with so much talent would choose his career over getting married to a woman without having to work at all .|0
"If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film ""Nemesis"", then you'll love this one. I loved it the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like ""Nemesis"" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them."|1
the mtv sci - fi animated series ` ` æon flux ' ' is brought to life with charlize theron playing the title character of that movie . but , you see , they do have something special going on after this movie was made , so why not start acting it up now in order to impress the rest of your fellow cast members . i can tell by the first paragraph of the novel that it could be a better sequel than the one i saw when i went to see her last night . i am glad to say there was nothing as good as this one .|0

"" if you get into the scene , let me know so i can advise you on how this will work ."|0
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character.|1
I'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. Afraid I'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, shame about the execution.|1
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? GIANT cgi versions of these beasts which battle! However I do require one of the guns used in the movie. Because apparently they are using cheats. Count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. Regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.The sound effects used in the movie for the Komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. Oh and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealthy as hell?|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philip.Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
bog creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge , and some potential to make a contribution . in fact , there are two of them here tonight who have spent enough money to cover this film . i think they are looking for an ' action movie ' , and will use this film to raise money for a lot of stuff . the one that is best for this series was originally set up in paris , but has recently re - written itself . i hope you love the film , and enjoy reading about it .|0
koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films , but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down . when i first started this series , i thought they were too boring for any author , but it was hard to know that the movie was not a complete waste of time . the plot was excellent and there were many enjoyable features in the premise , though the overall story line is a bit overdone . this novel has some interesting elements ( such as a few memorable events from the 1950s and sixties ) , but the main thing is that you do n't need to pay attention to all of these things .|0
"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous rift, a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"".The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife."|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap.There are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun about Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if your are the Germany equivalent of an inbred redneck (=inbred Southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you certainly will fail at this and also at life.|1
When I was five years old, it was my favorite television show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday. The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day now, I learned something new with Paula and Janis.|1
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...Grand Champion. The story of a 12 year old boy (Buddy) that with the help of his sister, Mom and best friend is determined to raise a Grand Champion steer. It is a whimsical journey to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hokey....it would be on a bun!|1

excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today . many consider just two out of the year ' s best picture , but it ' s no contest . i was a little concerned about this movie when we bought it . i liked this story and thought i was going to get an exciting ending . not so . this is the biggest movie ever produced in all of these years . the characters seem like they have seen more than their fair share of movies , and if you watch hard - core reality tv you are told that this is a great movie .|0
"As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many over dramatizations in ""made for TV movies"" and the craziness of the reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience.I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict."|1
now first let me say i love god awful movies . especially horror films mainly . i watched hundreds of them in high school ( and i can assure you , i am disappointed that they made this kind ) and i loved them . i loved them as much as i have ever loved anything in my life . a lot of good movie shows are made by men who spend all their money on movie trailers . i mean really ? what is going on in the world of modern sci - fi movies , where people live so far apart ?|0

"...""Flight of the Living Dead"" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ""I'm a producer, can'tcha tell?"" Thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because I feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. Apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-DVD release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like Richard ""Three O'Clock High"" Tyson, Erick ""Stargate"" Avari, and Raymond J."|1
i have to agree with the previous author ' s comments about the excellent performances and plot . started watching this film in a few days , it was quite a challenge to watch what had happened on that film but i really did think it was a fantastic movie . i also saw how it went down because of one of the characters that had done an act or two ( which made me cringe at the description ) . the actors seemed like they had tried to make up a story for themselves , but unfortunately it did not turn out to be as interesting as we thought .|0
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness, ""Half Empty"" is a must-see. This original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make ""The Producers"" seem boringly staid. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. When his book on happiness, ""North Star"" finds zero success in the States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour."|1
"i was a guest at the sept . 30th screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story , "" ' tis only in my opinion that this film will ever be released . this movie is so terribly sad , there is no hope that anyone will ever be able to take it seriously . for some reason , the actors are afraid to tell people about themselves , or the plot , or their true feelings . i suppose it could just as easily have been a comedy . maybe it did sound like an ironic comedy ."|0
"This film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but ""Sweet and Lowdown"" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable, that I do not want to now about him, or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore."|1
"* * * spoilers * * * * * * spoilers * * * there ' s not much that can possibly be a good description of the story itself . the main point is this : it seems to me that people have been doing this for too long . one person - who was also in the camera , said , "" i don ' t know why anyone would want to do this film with such an audience , but they didn ' t waste any money or effort on this kind of crap . i think it ' s all a bunch of nonsense ."|0
'The Dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.As 'Sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'King Lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times.|1
This movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans that I have ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive!|1
Pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. All the characters are OK, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing.|1
unlike one of the reviewers below , i do n ' t think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead . it may be easy to tell you that this movie was not very good , but at least we have some good examples of what happens when people fall into a bad mood - or worse , after they find out who they really are . the first part is fairly simple . for example , there were two things about this documentary that i didn ' t like . 1 ) i didn ' t know how to get through to the audience .|0
"Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? Is there even just a single genuinely FUNNY parody film anymore? All I see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself ""Sports Movie"". It's the same thing, though."|1
this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80 ' s entertainment . oh do n ' t get me wrong , it is an impressive and interesting film , but i just ca nt figure out what made it great . when you go in to see one of the most exciting films of your lifetime , you really have to take some time to find out who is behind these things . i personally found the film to be bad , with no redeeming quality . as a writer , it is my first reading of the film in a year .|0
i am partly a fan of miyazaki ' s work . i say ` ` partly ' ' because most of his films are pretty cool . i mean , in the end , all you have to do is put on a big show and everyone gets along . if this film can not be sold , however , why bother ? we have no idea how to buy it . there is absolutely no reason for us to get used to it . let me tell you that one of the few ways to make movies is to go back and take a look at a book .|0
"When I first heard about ""Greek,"" I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of ABC Family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a TV screen."|1
so , wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time , this time replacing the interesting characters of the film in the original . we have a few more scenes to re - write and one more set of episodes to redo . as you may have heard , the movie is quite entertaining and the characters are funny . i think it was meant to be funny but it just sort of went pear shaped . if you want to read part two of this book then i am sorry i did not include more than 10 minutes into this chapter .|0
"This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers ""San Pedro Beach Bums"".My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a ""walk"". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...)."|1
"""De Dominee"" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But that doesn't really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! It lacks substance and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action!"|1
ExCUSE me, but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o' poop. As the evil sister with hair that Mommy Dearest would envy, I did my very best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. I'm sad that this did not come across... Ah well, a friend compared it to a 'rock bottom budget SHOWGIRLS' with a white hot spoon.' I'll have to be content with that. What amazes me is no one mentioned the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt contest. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history.|1
"i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive production . "" what do you want to ask ? "" i asked with a wide - eyed look . "" did we get anything , that 's all i know for sure . here , i 'll show it to you . "" she put the dvd on the player and turned it up . the film was one of my most favorite horror flicks . there was a scene where a guy who was about to kill his family is killed in the middle of a town full of people ."|0
without doubt , grand champion has the most impressive cast of ` ` aaa ' ' level stars and musicians ever gathered together . i should not have been surprised if you ' ve all heard that movie . i ' ve never seen the film , which is one of the reasons i had picked this story . it was a great choice . but i felt that this was a waste of money . when i first looked at the show , i just couldn ' t figure out why someone who actually lives in america would want to live in a town like san francisco .|0
now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs , and all my friends and i thought it was the worst film ever ; but it actually was a horror movie ( except for some of the real ones ) and then there are those who do n't like the acting . they think it 's pretty lame , so i gave it to them anyway . you can almost hear the soundtrack of the movie playing in your head at that point . i wanted to buy the dvd as soon as i got back home from school , but could n't afford it .|0
this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 % more likely to fall into the water than to get it . the problem is how you could have done it . even if you were the only person around with the skills to save the world from such a catastrophe , you would rather be the only one to save it . there are some guys who think i am a nut case but honestly i am just a dumb guy with a lack of education . i have a friend that is like my mother ( she was raised by an older brother ) .|0
first , what is really great about this movie : - ryan reynolds , great acting ! there are very few things good about this movie , i think the best is just being with me in the company of a beautiful woman who can read and write . i never thought of myself as one of these romantic comedians so i am surprised that you like this movie more than i do , i was hoping you would like the book and if you want to go for a quick review it might be good to start reading my reviews from other magazines or at some other local bookseller .|0
We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. The west Texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him.|1
what can i say about this movie , it really is one of the worst gay themed movies , ever . it has been in the family for as long as anyone knows and does n't want to be seen on a tv . it is pretty much impossible to capture the essence of the action . you ca n't just turn off all the lights because it is too late . the actors do n't have any idea how to act or make a movie . they have no idea how to talk to each other or how to write their own script .|0
"Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously.... Scott is a shady character who preys on women. In this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California.The sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version.Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", one of Hitch's reputed favorite films."|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it.|1
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. Saw is just that.The movie is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility.|1
sorry about the ` ` extremely clever ' ' summary phrase . i do n ' t know what i was thinking , but it couldn ' t have turned out to be any worse . there is something else going on that bothers me about this whole scene . why are these two characters so in love ? why did they want to make it a movie and not just a comedy ? i wish you could hear this movie coming out as it does - the most ridiculous thing i can think of with no real ending .|0
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).A haunting, intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From).The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.|1
Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc.|1
The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing.|1
it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids on the streets and how bad they look . but , no , this was really nothing compared to what we saw in the movie . all the characters were great ; they were both cute and funny ; they seemed to have a lot of energy to them , and for sure they were real . the first thing you notice when you step in the classroom is that these kids are way too old for their school . they do n't want to play basketball or soccer - that 's just silly .|0
This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. For god's sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. And where do I begin? The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@!|1
you know you ' re watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you . i ' m okay with it - but not by much , and in case you have an opinion , do n't get too attached . i can see that these guys must have thought that they were having a great time because there are so many interesting comments and amusing stories about themselves . oh no , this was all just a joke to them . even if they knew they were going to die tomorrow , i am not really looking for any fun or excitement in this story .|0
i rented this movie , because i noticed the cover in the video rental store . i saw nolte , who was an awesome actress , and had to do a little checking on her before i could figure out that she was really not bad . she was actually very nice and funny , and she even seemed to be able to speak with both the language and the actors . it was just weird how quickly you would miss one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen in my life . there was one thing i noticed for sure after watching the film - the quality of the characters .|0
the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker ( played by drake bell of that time ) . it is also a great horror film but not one that will ever be made . as you know i have been reading this movie for a long time and have no reason to believe these people are really involved in anything shady or scary . however , i thought it might make a decent movie and i guess i was wrong . the good news is that it does get a lot of attention . it makes you want to watch it because they are always pretty funny .|0
in fact it was awful . the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director . she had red hair and her skin looked as though it were being beaten off with a mallet . i know i do not like this film so i have tried to stop it ( again ! ) , but what can i say ? that movie is terrible . the scene is so disgusting , i do not even remember what happened . it makes my eyes water to look at the characters and their names on the back .|0
as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i have made the mistake of falling in love with this doctor , i thought it was all for the good . after a few minutes he left the hospital and we went off to get married . i was not expecting much from him . there were too many things between us that just did not make sense at the time . however , i found out about his son and i felt terrible . my wife is quite nice , but she is a total bitch and i hated her for it .|0
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's performance of their careers. The film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on DVD.|1
The Toxic Avenger, Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'.|1
It's 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So, why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible. Just...don't...watch it. I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child produced this entire movie.|1
"""Son of the Mask"" is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" instead. I must say that it is partially my fault, as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first ""Mask"" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster."|1
if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot , or corny acting , then backdraft is definitely off . i really do like this movie , but it 's just not good enough for my mood . as soon as i found out how bad this film was , i immediately started to look forward to this movie . i knew i could get one of my favorite people to agree with me on some things , and we might have an excellent collaboration . after all , she would love this movie , and it would make her very happy .|0
Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious.|1
Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program!|1
i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams , back in the early days . what was it like to be that kid with a parent who taught you all sorts of new things ? i ca n't begin to imagine how difficult it must be to live up to those expectations , and not have any idea who your parents were or what they look like . it was quite frustrating for me at the time - there was nothing else to do until my father started playing the violin . then i went home to wait for dad to play his violin .|0
"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches. ""Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."|1
i can get over the political parody ; even if this was suppose to be a ` ` masters of horror ' movie , it 's been pretty lame . i would say most of the things that we are seeing today are stupid or just not worth noting . in fact , i am thinking about it now , because i realize how dumb all of this is . for some reason , the people who live in this neighborhood do not look very smart . there are only three kids and their mother lives with them , and they spend so much time at home that they seem retarded .|0
"This one and the one prior ""Toulon's Revenge"" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series."|1
"because mr . bean almost never speaks , i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over his eye as he explains what is being said in a video . * * * 
 an hour and a half later i am seated at the dining hall table watching a basketball game . one of the guys told me that we were supposed to watch this after the movie , but i was just trying to watch it before starting my day . i do n't really care about the movie , but i feel like there 's something missing out on it ."|0
"I still count ""Police Squad!"" as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that ""Police Squad!"" was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like ""You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan."|1
first of all , i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen . i also want to introduce a little bit more humor to the film , in hopes that you can get a hint of what is on stage . i really was looking forward to this story and if you are interested in it , i hope you will be willing to let me take some notes so we can find a way to see it together . i am sure you have a lot of questions . as i said , it has been quite a pleasant time for me .|0
Monday, October 02, 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese take-out, turned off the lights and pushed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was most certainly a let down. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present, a cannot be omitted sex scene, and the all too familiar pre-spook (when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy).|1
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's celibate lesbian manager.|1
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i do n ' t want to pay money to watch this movie with my wife . well it started off as some kind of really great film , in a way it was pretty bad . all the directors had their hands tied and were trying to come up with something new that would allow them to keep their careers - but there was just so much for them to do that it did n't interest any of them . i mean if they had stayed in hollywood they would have made a great film .|0
"(This has been edited for space)Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola's ""Thérèse Raquin""."|1
This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.The movie's timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors.|1
"I think the ""Bone Snatcher"" should go after anyone associated with this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker."|1
i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster . it was funny because the title was so lame , and there was only one character to do it . she was a great actress though , but at the end of the film she ended up being a total waste of money . the book is such a big hit with characters from every country in the world - even the united states , they all make the same movies - that you can literally count on just about anyone for a plot line .|0
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it.she is 6 and she loved the film, some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was Eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was Jordan's video?! but she did enjoy it. i noticed the mistakes such as at the end Jordan was not actually playing the guitar, but she never.|1
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow, I didn't find him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' Bruno Anthony.Overall, I would highly recommend this.|1
"I cannot stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so ""distressed"". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? You should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo.I take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they yelling so much? Why is everyone so mean?"|1
i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s - - films so ridiculous and silly that they seem as stupid as the movies themselves when compared with the original . but these are the real movies . this is one of them . ( i have watched this movie three times , and know it is not really a movie at all . i just want to get back to it . ) this movie is based on an old hollywood movie that was remade in 1953 . it depicts a film about a couple who are having a very exciting affair after having sex in an abandoned house .|0
after seeing naked city and night and the city ( which is still my favorite dassin ) i was more than a little surprised that i had never read any of this before , even though it would have meant reading about it . i really wanted to see this other world when i first saw it . but since then i have not seen or heard of it because i have never seen a movie where it could have been filmed . also , i have only been in new york a few times in the last ten years .|0
"Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. They might as well call this show ""Generic"", because that's what it is. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals."|1
"Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS ""event"". There's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring bland by-the-book TV drama clichés. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. What kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot."|1
the bone snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in mexico city . this has been discussed in more depth than ever before . this story is full of intrigue and drama . i know it sounds like a bad play , but we need to have a laugh at this one . why not ? what do people want to believe about their life ? how many times are we supposed to pretend that there really is an afterlife or that everyone is still alive so they can die ?|0
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to Hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring!!! The acting in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as though some people from an Evangelic Church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. It wasn't real-life dialog at all.|1
' the 4th floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring juliette lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a time doing anything and everyone in it , so much so that she 's made an unglamorous movie . i 'm not sure why i did n't see this last week when i was living here , or if it even has a soundtrack , but it was one of the worst reviews i could have ever had . it was just another thing to add to my list of crappy reviews . what a waste of material .|0
While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice.

"This film easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of ""12 Angry Men"". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie."|1
... when we all know, no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of Sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. How disappointed was I! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.However me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style.|1
Normally I don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception.Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I watched this movie through to the end. I'm always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this, but I suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better.|1
Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing.|1
"this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray . that ' s how it came to be on the screen in this film , "" he says , his eyes twinkling with amusement . 
 "" is n't that just a waste of time ? "" i ask with a smile . 
 "" not as much as my own first kiss , "" he says with a wink . i roll my eyes and shake my head . "" you should see yourself when you 're wearing a corset , mr. hamilton . """|0
okay , that was just brilliant . i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong . it sure as hell would have given me a good head start . but there was no way for me to know what kind of game these guys were up to . in fact , all i knew was that the first few games i won were horrible . i still ca n't believe they did that . i loved watching the other players trying to beat one another and end up getting hurt . i felt sorry for the team when they lost their first two games ( which were pretty lousy ) .|0
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along.|1
what i hoped for ( or even expected ) was the well known ` ` stop motion ' ' imagery and extreme visualizations . this series is quite a few different ways to write your movie , and some are not bad at all . in fact , there is one more thing , which may be better than the others . it would also be good if you knew that there is nothing but a very hard work ethic in this production . every person who wants to be on the show sees this as an excellent example of how we are all destined to be treated by the rest of the world .|0
OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well.First off, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Other than those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror.|1
"i never fell asleep during a movie . never . this movie did the impossible . while many people claim the superiority of the movie , there are just some things you ca n't forget . one of the worst parts about this movie is the words "" good acting "" on the screen . what a waste of time ! if you had a screenplay you would enjoy it immensely . as i have told you earlier , this story is not a complete horror film and has no theme other than in the beginning . it really stinks . there are all sorts of horrible characters to make up for this ."|0
Move over Manos. Back off Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst film ever. The only horror in this thing is watching it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. If this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. It's dreck. No wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck.|1
"I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.Ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call ""assistant"" to Evie, a retired actress."|1
i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish . my aim is to help people who do not like their movies better . the first one was for a young man in an expensive - looking , dark coloured suit who was sitting with his parents at a pub . they were laughing and talking and watching some movie that he had seen but had not understood . when he saw the television screen it did not make much sense and he left it to them to try something else . after a while he found himself walking away from the group of friends and got into another taxi .|0
"Jack Higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into ""one last job"" (where have I heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot."|1
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal which I have visited. It is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.A film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. Well, a wait is a wait.|1
Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Mask of Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoir's 'The Southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money.|1
` ` yesterday ' ' as a movie , is hard to rate . the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9 / 10 rating - but let 's be realistic . the film itself is one of the worst of all the movies i ever saw in my life , from what i can see it has very little comedy value . i do n't have that many friends , particularly not since i was an only child . there was never any reason why i should spend my life on a tv show , let alone trying to get myself a job at a film company .|0
"If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I am a huge fan of ""B"" movies, and I have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. This movie even surpasses the ""so bad it's good"" phase and goes straight on to the ""so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it"" phase.It is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1."|1
i must first mention that as a group of mates , we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are not very entertaining . on one occasion a man who was about to go through a bad time at a party could have made an appearance . however , he would have been able to do little or no good if he had done so . for the first two years after his death and the second few years after that , there was never much action . it was as if they did not really care about anything .|0
master plan : have the winning team in a deadly tournament . one of several martial arts action pictures that are posted on their website by ethiopian , but you never know what could go wrong . it gets worse each year . the first part of this movie turns out to be more like a soap opera than any film i had ever seen in my life . the only real difference between this movie and any of the movies i have seen is how many people there were . most of the people who were in the group ( which was about 3 , 000 people at the time ) get away with things .|0
the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french ` ` emmanuelle 2 . ' ' this amazing woman is a prostitute . i was at a party and there were three men in the picture . two are dead , the third has some sort of mental disease that makes him unable to act . she looks like a young woman who has taken up with a sex addict . she acts like she is enjoying herself but then she starts having sex with other men . i do n't really think it 's such a great movie as it is .|0
"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said ""wow what a good movie."" Someone actually walked out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough."|1
oh man , this movie was toe - cringing bad . bad look , awful story . . . the list of good things in life are limited only to the characters . . . . and i 'm not a fan of crappy movies ( at least i do n't like crappy movies ) but this one actually made me laugh . i 've been watching this movie for three months and there is no better film on the market . the first two films that did make me laugh seemed to have a certain appeal . but then they just kind of fizzled .|0
i ' m not going to say the story of the movie as some people do . i ' m pretty sure this is all a load of bs . if you ' re interested , just go ahead and take it - but for god ' s sake , take it from someone else ' s perspective . it ' s one of the most ridiculous things i ' m ever seen in an american movie . when i saw this film last year at school , it was only a little funny , and even so , it didn ' t make sense .|0
"I agree with all the comments posted so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. Terrible CGI, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing has got to be the Native American angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions (""Do not do this thing! ""), Native American pipes playing in thin air, etc."|1
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane. It was a HUGE waste of time seeing this crappy film. There are a lot of things i hate about this movie: The songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'Grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of Santa' which i hit 10 Times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel.I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen.|1
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers.|1
When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat.|1
Now, I like the Bollywood films and I'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish.The idea of a modern-Bollywood take on Amadeus was quite an exciting one, that is until the two supposed 'musicians' appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man, and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities, but he is never once believable as a modern Mozart.|1
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more similarly to this, there's Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie's a D-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it.|1
The Mummy's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one. Kharis and his mate Ananka both end up in the bayous of Louisiana, and on his resurrection, he searches out his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana isn't made entirely clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders.The Mummy's Curse was watchable, but it really wasn't anything special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I'd seen this before.|1
"I've lost count of the times I have seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it. The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. The characters, especially ""Nitro"", ""Sonar"" and ""Stepanik"" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast. I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out."|1
Dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no cash Sofia Coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus. The cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b&w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance.Yet there are one or two things to note. Inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots.|1
i ' ve never made one of these before , but this movie was literally so bad i had to say it . we were standing in the middle of a crowded street , just sitting there trying to remember where we were , and my stomach was already tied in knots by the time we got out of the cab . i looked at the rest of the movie and thought how stupid this movie was - who gets to see the action in real life with movies like this ? not me . no one is allowed to watch them . if they did , they would only get their picture taken .|0
"In Thailand, the Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins to a clan of ""good"" vampires leaded by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from the claws of Niran.I expected that ""Vampires: The Turning"" were a good movie."|1
having just watched acacia , i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here . i like this version of the story better than the other . it would be very embarrassing if you and your brother had been chosen to witness a murder in which they were caught up in a horrible crime . however , the main problem with what happened is that the plot has already been blown out of proportion . i mean there is no one to say whether or not it was a murder or not , so how should we classify it as a murder ?|0
first of all , even imdb is slacking with this movie , as the list of cast is very ` ` pretty ' . i do n't know what to do with that , though . there are a lot of people who love this film and have been so impressed with it that they feel sorry for the actors - but only because they can make out how the movie was made . in other words , it did not show any kind of real life at all . if it did , it had no character , no plot , and most of the characters seem to be illiterate .|0
"looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic , but yet again its just another example of how i will never get a decent script . and not only that , i can not make it any less interesting . no , there are more reasons why ' t you ever go to la ? "" "" well , what else was i supposed to do while we were filming our first movie ? i actually had some time to sit on my computer and work through the script . as i told the director last night , i really could not believe that so few actors have come forward with scripts like this ."|0
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named ""luther"". Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local Kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.Luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY tv show gets naked."|1
"my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store . from the cover it looked like a lot of people were doing their hair and makeup . i remember that one scene well , not having to sit in the first row and watch it for more than 30 minutes . it was amazing . "" the camera cut to a dark haired woman sitting in the back with her husband . as they walked out of the theater , the lights went down and we were forced to squint in the sudden darkness . then the camera panned over to a black suv parked next to the main theater ."|0
It's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a TV show.DORIS DAY decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why.|1
this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth . yet , you can see that it is not all that much of a story . the whole thing seems to have gone downhill from there - and i 'm glad to see that i was n't the only one who got sucked in by what happened . after all , what could go wrong ? some people might say that the plot was bad ; others might say it was good . but they were not wrong . the worst part is that so far no one has actually solved anything .|0
i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday . there are good and bad effects , but this is n't one of those . it would be a different story if we actually made it through that year . here is how it goes for you . first of all , the village was really built from wood and rock . what is wrong with that ? this place was built by a very rich and well respected family . they lived in a huge mansion in a large valley . this was a great city because the people were friendly .|0
before seeing the sneak preview today of angels & demons , i cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might have been there . this story is a work of fiction made up to portray what happened at the time of the murder of one of our best actors . for the most part , it appears that the perpetrator was a young man who was being held hostage by an extremely powerful and dangerous group of people . however , based on the information presented by the film , i am surprised to learn that they all had guns .|0
"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!!"|1
"there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)""nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed."|1
"mikio naruse ' s examination of the lives of three idling , constantly complaining , single ex - geishas in post - war japan is not a good combination for this particular story . when i originally wrote this novella , i decided that it would be too depressing to see films such as this , and i started to think there might be something wrong with the whole concept of a horror movie , or perhaps i simply needed to take my own advice . however , here are the first words on page one : "" by the age of ten , i was an average high school student who had a normal upbringing ."|0
"The story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered ""valley girl"" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. What a great and worthy story line. But in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose?"|1
this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . unhappy ' easterners ' are not pleased with all the things that were put on this book so it could be considered some kind of film . even if you find the whole thing to be humorous , you will probably still have a bad time having an idea who the writer really is . the only interesting thing i can say about this movie is how much fun it is . for example , the acting was great ; the dialogue was just right . i would like to think that whoever made this movie was better than anybody else in hollywood .|0
the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable . it was just one of those days when everything in life can be totally messed up . i did my best to get into the film as usual , but it was not easy . the dialogue was a little bit too jerky for me . there are lots of places you can sit on a couch and not feel the need to sleep . it was a good movie , more than good . however , some of the scenes that were very interesting could not be compared to the way this movie portrayed itself .|0
"i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie . what is even more stupid is that i watched it while i was waiting for this movie to be over , when i actually did n't see it at all until now . "" "" you are such an idiot . the film is so lame . it is one of the first ones i have ever seen . just give me a break - it is horrible ! i love this movie ! we were so close to doing something funny in college , but instead we were sitting in a bar on the beach playing games ."|0
What can I say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, needed the money. What story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. The DVD is out at the moment in the UK.|1
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.|1
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years. There have been other films before that delved into the Vietnam Vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film, as a typical American suburban family, circa 1972, comes apart at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls. The cast is A++++ fantastic with all four actors(with Kathy Bates a stand-out) giving riveting performances. What is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides, but understand all four characters and empathize with them, even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs.|1
but i ca n ' t say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung . where to begin . the thing is , you / they did not even know that there was an ethiopian in the country . no one could have possibly understood the nature of the ethiopian language . for sure , as it happens , most of what they were saying must be very difficult for the inhabitants of ethiopian to understand and to read . i would rather live on a beach than spend half an hour trying to decipher words from the dialect .|0
one of my all - time favourite movies . nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time . if i wanted to watch this movie it was ok , but it is not ok with me because of the characters . what do i care ? i just want to have sex with someone so that i can get a real job and make enough money to buy another movie . why did i choose this movie ? i had no plans on seeing it again . anyway , i would like to recommend it to any young teen who really wants to go somewhere and learn more about how people in this country behave .|0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkinscreates a film like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. After they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in PunishmentPark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). I can't say enough about this movie.|1
This is a joke, right? This can't be a real film? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. The film maker's can't be serious... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama gone horribly wrong? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. The dialogue isn't clichéd.|1
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. You won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it.|1
"being a wrestling fan , movies about wrestling generally suck ( backyard dogs , bodyslam , jesse ventura story ) but we have been over and over with this film so i am not surprised to hear that it will be one of the greatest movies ever made . "" "" it 's a big deal for a small town like wrightsville beach . however , you do n't understand how hard it was just to come to wrightsville beach as opposed to walking away from it right away . unfortunately , there are plenty of ways to travel in america where they are more comfortable getting back into the game ."|0
imagine the most cliche ridden b - movie horror plot you can . add more plot holes than plot . have it in , and i mean literally . do n't waste time trying to think of any better way to describe it ! this was so much harder than you could possibly imagine . it seemed like a bad idea to write this film as it has no plot holes . i thought it would make sense , but that is not to say it did not . it just lacks the impact . the script does have some points , however . this story is completely out of character .|0
this movie is supposed to take place in milford nj . i know the house that it is based on . there is only a few people who do not look alike . i think they may be aliens or aliens , but i do not see why someone so small has to be so bad . i never heard anything about this movie . i mean really , if you go to hollywood , you have to be good enough . well , as soon as i get back to my apartment and sit down with the script , i am going straight to bed .|0
To be honest, I did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I watched the last weeks. The first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual).|1
"Mr. ""Uwe Fail"" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor Directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was awesome, its like a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of ""point and shoot"". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the ""point and shoot"" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another ""Uwe Fail"" movie you will understand."|1
hello all denver fans ! i could n ' t agree more with you guys ! this show was so cool and it was a complete bust to me , which is why i 'm not as excited as i should have been . the only thing that bothered me about what i just watched was the name of the film . the script was totally awesome and i guess i should be happy , but in my heart i was still disappointed that it was never finished . i really thought that it would take them at least an hour to make their move and even longer to come up for air .|0
lt . claude ( claudio cassinelli ) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by a british navy officer , who is sent to investigate what was done to them in the bahamas . no other survivors are known or any of their ships have surfaced , so it must have been very difficult to get away with everything they were doing . also , i still find this interesting . after checking out the site of the wreck of the ship , i think i might have read a good story about how it was found , which i never heard of .|0
This can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. But I have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to be remembered.To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted.|1
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the film.I think that if you hadn't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling)...).|1
i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it . based on a true story , this is an awesome movie that i will always remember . in the end , i did have something to say , but my opinion of the film was very small because of what i saw . this movie portrays a whole different person . someone who really wants to change their life for the better . however , i think it would have been nice to know there are some people alive who could actually make this work . unfortunately , you just ca n't find them anywhere .|0
"My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of ""bad"" movies. Among the flicks we watched, the strongest contender (for quality bad-movie fare) was easily Jack-O. It's ludicrous that movies such as ""Gigli"", ""Glitter"" and ""You Got Served"" are listed in IMDBs bottom 100. While they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. They're robbing ""Jack-O"", and ""Keeper of Time"", etc, of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve.So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)?"|1
"Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the ""hey, I've got an idea, let's make a sequel"" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said ""hit and run""!"|1
"a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon . the local priest ( who formerly dated isobel ' s sister ) is shocked and horrified when isobel ' s mother says , "" we ' ll have to call him in to explain why i ' m not coming down with this . he ' s been such a bad influence on my family and it ' s not like they ' re looking for some sort of revenge . if that was true , then they should have come to us immediately . there ' s nothing good about this guy ."|0
overall , a well done movie . there were the parts that made me wince , and there were the main parts that had me wondering if the whole thing was real . but i could see why they would try such a stupid stunt on film . i mean , it is just not funny . the idea that someone else wants to use an actor as a prop for a documentary does n't even make me feel very much better . i have been in this studio for almost a year now , and we have not watched one movie yet , so i can tell you how absurd this is .|0
"Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's way better than I expected. Those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. But it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this one to Sinan Çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage ""Propaganda"", this movie is pretty damn good.One thing that MUST be said: It deals with the highschool students' life in Turkey VERY realistically!"|1
i understand that people have different expectations of low - budget , arthouse movies . i also know that john sayles has his own opinions about the films , as well . however , i do n't think he would have chosen to get involved with a television show like this one in the first place , because it is really too much for him . what was most disappointing about this movie was how it only had a plot line and nothing to do with the movie itself . not only was this film predictable , but it was no worse than the others in the movie .|0
Why are there no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the Japanese officers brown nose Jim Brown's character.This is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.This is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun.|1
from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence . showing moses as a murderer . people who have seen it all in their wildest imaginations will always wonder what they were doing in such an extreme case . i , on the other hand , thought that it would be a good experience to watch and make a movie . there are many of them but one thing was not at all amusing . it was very slow going . no matter what the actors did , the action was still unsatisfying . it looked as though the character went straight to the movies with no attempt to look normal .|0
"well , here we have a zombie movie that perhaps is n ' t even being much of a zombie movie . "" he looks around the room . "" how about you two ? "" i look over to becca as she sits beside brian on the couch . "" yeah , i guess it 's not great , but it 's better than some of the others i 've seen lately . "" "" that 's true , "" becca agrees , nodding in agreement . "" i would say that at least three of the other movies do n't sound good . "" brian smiles . """|0
this film stinks more than limburger cheese ! if you find this at a garage sale , leave it there and do n't look back . i hate to say it , but it just is the only way to see this film . as for the rest of the production , we should be prepared for that . even if i had known how hard it would be , i still would've done it . one of the main characters was young and attractive - not necessarily cute - but beautiful , with an open smile and a soft heart . then there 's the music .|0
Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone? ), but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom.|1
i walked into heart of gold thinking i was going to watch a documentary about neil young . instead , i am left with this : that guy can sing his lines in the shower . it 's pretty funny seeing him as he soaks up the hot water from the faucets and turns the water on high . i wonder how old he is because he is definitely younger than me . when i see him at work , i feel like i know him from somewhere but could n't recall where . i 'm not good at names so i try not to be able to remember who he is or where he lives .|0
"(Contains spoilers)People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the ""Mississippi"", but - Catherine Deneuve."|1
"Not as bad as ""Billy Bathgate"" but close. Try as he might, Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. The other actors don't fare as well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft."|1
i could n ' t help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a little on the dramatic side . not that i thought it was much worse , but i never really get my hopes up about this movie . what 's the point in doing everything you can while watching someone play their role ? did it have to do with some sort of plot ? well yes , kind of , but not like this . this movie is definitely going to kill me and make me go crazy or just lose control of myself .|0
"Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in. I have not seen all of his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him best from ""Live and Let Die"" where he played Tee-Hee and which was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona!"|1
i remember seeing this film when i was 13 years old and i fell in love with it and i wanted to make it my first movie ever . well i did not fall in love at first or even at first . i was totally fascinated by this film because i had always dreamed of one day being an american idol , but i never saw any of these movies before . i think it was a lot of fun but as the credits rolled there was nothing good to do . it seemed like most of those movies were based on what we all knew about america .|0
Last year, I fell in love with the Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library. Though I think Burton's is best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I haven't seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on them.After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job.|1
I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid-90's as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained it power.It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.The movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc.|1
"The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It's the story of a young retarded person, called ""Zep"" (sic). A night, he sees his sister's SM sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! Zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. One man will find them. One man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist."|1
i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv . in some sort of odd , surreal manner , the announcers were describing the movie from the start , but what really happened was that there are actually several different versions of it . each one has a different ending , and the acting is similar , but at the same time you find yourself looking forward to hearing the rest of it . my father had told me all about the film after i had finished high school . he said that i was just a kid once ; now i think he was right .|0
i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap . this anti - bush propaganda was ridiculous , and i knew it . when i first started watching the films i was disgusted with my lack of understanding of reality . there are no things worse than being watched in one 's head by someone who claims to live inside a box . so i would never understand this movie ' s real meaning . they have to have some idea what is wrong with the character . why does he keep acting as if everything is normal ?|0
"I can't say if ""The Cavern"" is a ripoff of ""The Cave"" because I haven't seen that. I've seen ""The Descent"" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. Hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. There are times when I guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting?"|1
like another poster mentioned ch . 56 ( a local boston tv station ) showed this multiple times over the course of many years . but it would be hard to imagine that this is a documentary or anything else about any of these characters . they are just plain dumb . you can see how well they were able to put up an act which was very good . as i told you in my last book i could not believe what i saw on the telly . the first time i had seen this movie i wanted to get home and start watching it again .|0
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
it may be , although there are still two or three i ' ve missed . this film constructs an interesting picture and it makes me want to try a few different things . the fact is , you get the impression of people wanting something that they do not have the ability to make yourself . in some of the most famous movies on the planet , it ' s like the guy gets up from the couch , puts on his shoes , says good - bye to his girlfriend and goes out onto the porch with her .|0
i was n ' t expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face . julie walters , a good friend of mine , told me that all this was just some kind of sham game to make it seem like they are going to live happily ever after . i guess there 's no reason to believe that these characters will be content with their entire lives . how could anyone who has suffered such suffering be able to have such an optimistic attitude for their lives ? i think most people on earth would rather enjoy their lives instead of having a hard time finding happiness .|0
"It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes, trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more, where it failed miserably. Some may like the nontraditional ending, but the attempts at ""deep insight"" into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere.But if you were interested by the story, the movie tried other methods to distract you. The unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was the most obvious, served to do nothing but annoy. The camera-work is erratic at best.One note of caution, however."|1
"Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It sure was no ""Later Day Saints."" The movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. But the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.Even though ""Kiss"" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for TV movie. Every scene is lighted like a department store."|1
"an obvious cash - in on the * insert monster here * on a plane gimmick , flight of the living dead . "" and if you want me to get back to my original premise , i need to hear it again from this film as well . there are so many things in the movie , it does n't matter if you can see everything through the window . but what matters is that these people have been murdered . no one said anything about having been murdered before . it would seem like they were only murdered during the previous year , right ?"|0
"I can't disagree with a previous comment that ""Driving Lessons"" is more than a little twee, but one man's indictment is another's endorsement, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself.I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress."|1
being a fan of the series i thought , how bad can the movie be ? well i got my first taste for horror , and now it 's time to experience the sequel ! yes , i wrote this as a way to pass the time in the movies but at the time , i did n't think i could enjoy them so much . anyway , here is a piece of the story that makes me want to take some seriously . what was the worst part about this one ? the parts that made you think that these were real characters ? the most terrible part ?|0
i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow . i would not think about it because , the truth is , i could not live without this movie . i mean , who wants to watch this movie in the first place ? anyway , here we go , a lot of people want to see this film but that does not stop them from getting bored . they are too stupid to see anything else and all of them spend a long time trying to come up with something more entertaining . the only thing they really thought they knew was what to do with the film .|0
"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream."|1
great book , poorly done movie . cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore - fest . flat - out shitty reviews ( not that i did it all by myself ) are so bad that the plot is almost as bad as the acting . in fact , they should have just been given a script and made a few films to pass the time . i can understand why these idiots would want an actual film for their own sake . no one has ever come up with a reason or reason to create such a monster .|0
i ' m glad they finally released it on dvd . i bought the video tape years ago and watch it whenever i can , but nothing compares with this . i will have to give it a shot for next year ' s movie . anyway , i ' ve got to say that this is an awesome film . i had no idea people could make such high quality films as these . there was a chance that most people would agree with me ; but that ' s about as good as it gets in this business . besides , the movie has great reviews .|0
what a crappy movie ! the main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in a family of super - wealthy billionaires , but instead he became an ass * * le who stole his own mother 's money so he can live in a trailer park . no way ! it just did n't end well . if there was anyone who could handle that kind of film , it 's me . i think this is one of the most unimpressive movies i have ever seen . how does this movie relate to the other books ?|0
I'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. Instead of legitimately dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).|1
after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat - scan , a metal object in it ' s brain makes some of the world ' s most beautiful people appear to be watching it on video or something . i just want this movie to be over . i do n't see what the problem is ( not that there were any problems ) , i just think it would be better to watch the film from another perspective . no one will understand what happened here , and the main character wo n't believe that he was actually killed .|0
i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i ' m a big fan of that movie . so , i would love to hear more on it if you do n't mind . anyway , after reading the first draft , i knew that this was not going to make it and so i went back to the book shop and gave it a try . it didn ' t go very well , i ' d seen the movie over and over and once again felt an overpowering need to leave .|0
the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory . that ' s reason enough to look at this little film , but the fact that i have written it here for a whole two minutes shows me there is no way you could make this film because you ' ll have to be an ass * * le to do something about it ! so i found myself waiting around for laura to come out of her apartment and see what the fuss was about . apparently , she had a party last night that took place at her house .|0
"Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch? And I got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is ""different"", someone nobody understands... She is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. Besides, Brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so... Fake."|1
This movie, which I just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel, rather than on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of Coney Island.|1
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue.|1
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he's to quit touring and the other Boys calls him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group.|1
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one.For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.2. You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie. (believe me, it's my domain)3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.4.|1
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house that it is based on as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. I know that, because I was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing.|1
i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious ; it ' s not like american pie or something . this is actually a very interesting film that i am watching , but i really didn ' t pay much attention to what they were doing . i thought it was all one - sided so i don ' t think i ' ll ever get to hear what happened in the movie anyway . i guess i just wanted to see if this would be a good movie to watch . now i ' m beginning to look around for an excuse to leave , as well .|0
"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.First of all ""The Messengers"" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial."|1
"But it's not. The plot isn't all that bad, the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent. Instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those ""I can't believe he/she is so dumb"" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character. Also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie. Anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up."|1
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference.|1
I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard of it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion.|1
from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . i mean if it 's that bad , why try to make up something as terrible as an amateur film about the past and the future . in my opinion though , the only good reason we have ever made any of this film are the fact that the movie is so unoriginal that it really does not have a theme . the main character is a real jerk when he pretends to be someone else who is actually somebody else , which makes it even more awful .|0
i never read the book . now i do n ' t really want to . i had no clue what this was and , as far as i knew , did not even know about a book until i found out . however , i could not wait to see what it was like . i loved books and liked all the good thrillers i saw on cable . when i finally read the book i sat back in my desk and watched the movie for a long time . at first , i thought they were just making jokes , but then i saw that there were more words in the book than just words .|0
"SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yep, that'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of ""Lord of the Rings"", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now, with ""Everything Is Illuminated"" he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character."|1
this episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror , so far this season masters of the story . i can assure you , though , that if you have been watching this movie many times , it may seem more than it is . there is nothing particularly amusing about a series of characters whose life has been turned upside - down over the years . it just seems to be getting better every day . here are some good examples of my friends from the 1920s and 1930 's who made fun of the fact that the plot was one of the most stupid films ever made .|0
With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.|1
first , let me confess that i have not read this particular balzac novel , so maybe i am directing it a little too poorly . i was hoping to find the sequel - after all , what else is there to do in a sci - fi movie ? anyway , my husband and i are on our honeymoon and he wanted to spend time with his family . when he arrives at home , he discovers that his wife is gone and we were going to go to her house for dinner and have a night of romantic lovemaking .|0
one of the worse gay - related movies i have ever seen . since these are not characters in this story it seems a good idea that they all watch this movie separately and make sure to keep them away from the main characters . for some reason , i felt as if this film is being used to create an atmosphere of homogenism . i do n't usually watch such films but i saw one once which was pretty bad so i did my research . the author seemed to enjoy making people feel sorry for themselves , even though his words were unflattering at first .|0
whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30 ' s , 40 ' s and 50 ' s , you were guaranteed great things . this movie was very good , although i would have thought it was more for show quality , rather than commercial quality . i personally do n't see much of any of these movies , and i can not imagine why they ever made this one . when i first started seeing these films , i was shocked to see that there was an abundance of pornography going on . there is certainly no doubt that many of these movies were taken during the war between the states .|0
a wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie . 75 + % entertainment . casey , buddy , kelly marsh , bob and i have always wanted to see a classic film , but of course that had not come up on any level during my visit here . i am hoping for something more in common with movies as well , but i just did not want to spoil the fun we were about to get involved in by taking this job . i thought it would be fun to take a day or two off after living in new york for so very long .|0
beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women . his work is good and he does excellent work . i would love to see this movie , but the script is not very well written . i do not really believe that it has any merit whatsoever . in fact , i doubt that i could find anyone on the planet who would want to pay $ 50 an hour to watch this movie unless they are a real comedian or writer . the plot is so bad that if you looked hard enough , you could probably figure out which category it was .|0
great party movie , following the adventures of bill & tom , two high school buddies at opposite ends of the world . not only were they fighting , but they hated each other . i can imagine how this would have played out had one of the guys been more understanding and not so annoying . it does not make sense that they would fight about who got to watch what , or who won . why would both people choose to spend the day together after having spent the weekend together ? there has to be something off about all this .|0
this film was great ! tangi miller and flex did a great job . they both look good together and the lead singer is one of the best we have seen . i 'm glad that it has come out for this movie as well . its really not worth watching . if you like , let me know when it 's ready and i will be available for you in a month or so . just tell me where you put the credits . i ca n't make any money at this production . i love being an actor but can not stand to watch someone else work .|0
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. I don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in Ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. I love the serious look that he's got going on. Its like that programme that was on on a Sunday morning that i forget the name of lol.|1
I would say this is a background movie. Play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). I thought this was a film that was done before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The screenplay/script is pretty awful. I love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. Ughh. It almost seems like it's a made for TV movie based on the cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? Even the secretary breaks out into song.|1
the only reason i did n ' t fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable . now , how can someone sit on a seat like that ? i have seen plenty of horror flicks in my time , but this movie is awful . every character , from the top down , to the bottom of the body and the head , is completely messed up . i wish i had a good friend or two who would help me out , but i was too self - absorbed to think anything of it .|0
"Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident ""The Wind and the Lion"" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa.El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman(Candice Bergen) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of American president Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre.The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photography, very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness."|1
"normally i am a typical ` ` creepy - crawly - hatin ' ' ' girl , but after watching this film ( on youtube of course ) i decided it would be the last one i watched so i did my best to ignore it . there are only six scenes with these two girls and they both look just like any other college kid , well , except that their hair is a tad shorter and they do not look as nerdy . anyway , here goes : 
 "" come on , show me your fangs and i will teach you how to make vampires ."|0
"In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was ""Just a Nightmare"" and it was very well written!! and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks."|1
i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version . in my first attempt at a new movie , it was pretty bad and ended up having to go home after watching about an hour of the show . i did n't know what the worst that could have been was because there were so many parts for it that we could all just sit around and watch . as you can imagine some of the horror films are actually very horrible and i ca n't blame anyone for hating them . i hope you liked this one .|0
three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up in the world , where they will never know what it is like not to be a child . that was the reason why i spent so much of my time looking through the files on this program . i was sure that there would be a pattern , some clue to what was going on , but it was n't ever there . the kids were just born when they were supposed to be at school . their parents could have been murdered by terrorists for being late .|0
actually i ' m still in doubt if there ' s anything about this movie i like . as for the story itself , i ' m more than happy to share with you that it was originally made in new york , but is being rerun over the next few years , a bit too fast , and not much of a first edition . after watching this movie for a very brief while ( which may be one of the most interesting stories i have seen in the past ) , i decided to give it a couple of weeks to see if i could get any details about what it was doing on my tv .|0
"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. This movie focused more on a ""let's just make it gory"" view.The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. I wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively."|1
i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show . it is so boring . the jokes on this film are so silly and the stories so uninteresting . not a bad plot , except for the fact that it ' s only an act . the most important thing to write about in this story is the characters and they ' re both really good actors . if you ' d read these books as a child , you would see that this movie is basically one of those comedy films . the plot is lame , the dialogue is ridiculous and the plot is stupid .|0
"i know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; i was , at first , a little sceptical of its effectiveness . 
 "" what s wrong with it ? "" i said to the group . 
 "" they are quite advanced in many ways , you will probably hear this story before ever hearing it , but that is not why i want you all to be there . "" "" ok ... "" i said . 
 "" as for how we can go back to the future , let me show you some things on this site . "" he produced a black digital camera and showed it around the screen ."|0
"Well...it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. The plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting oriented, but in ""The Shepard"", JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape."|1
"Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who's the working definition of the word ""dreamer"" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California.Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.Could be better, could be worse.I gave this one seven out of ten."|1
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies.|1
"First of all, even IMDb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is VERY ""gappy"". Even main characters are missing from it like Buddy for example.Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much, is because I was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.The plot line itself is good. It could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting."|1
Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and judging from the enthusiastic response, he has much to be pleased about. A taught, well done Indy, impressive for it's big budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were were especially well cast in the leads, delivering strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film.|1
take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights . so , i was wondering if you are going to show up one day as a movie star or anything of this genre ? i mean , surely you can be any sort of actor . i never saw anybody that had an interest in acting on film . i do n't believe in actors , either , but i have been told that they will get along fairly well together . there really is only one type of acting in the movie , which i am proud to say that i have seen many times before .|0
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds the ""box"". As soon as Cole finds it he says, ""The box. Everyone's got a box"". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, ""We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often"".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert! )I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out."|1
"the movie was very good . i ' m an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to pick this film based on the premise or how the plot would be based on the characters - it ' s a lot of pressure to read what is actually happening . in some ways i really like sci - fi films . there are all sorts of weird people in the movie and the actors seem to have no reason to be angry about anything . but the acting , that is just downright depressing . i ' m always amazed how much you can change after a few minutes .

I love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...I thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. I was very disappointed. The martial arts is also suffering. I am hoping to see a more devoted Segal in his future films.|1
I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.The woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a great job playing the role. I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it.|1
like the beauty of the jungle , jessica alba ' s gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film , but in the final picture i am not even sure who she is or how to recognize her from any other photo . what does it say about me that i think a few of these people would recognize her when they saw her before ? are you kidding me now ? there really are two kinds of people in our world : those who come to this place to find fame and fortune and those who go back to looking as if nothing has happened .|0
i enjoyed ramin bahrani ' s man push cart , and this film is equally good . this slice of life on the road is really bad for me . as a kid , i spent most of my days watching horror flicks , and i thought this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . if you do n't pay attention to the plot then it makes you believe that the character is always going to be stupid , and that he will eventually succeed in making up some of his jokes . i think these movie shows were doomed from the beginning .|0
"as a word of explanation , disney ' s ` ` the kid ' ' has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin character .

S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig.|1
"Some movies you watch and you say, ""Well, that made no sense."" And you don't really mean it. You're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical. ""Bread And Circus"" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. From the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. There's no script. There's no plot. There's no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.So what?"|1
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good.|1
brilliant aussie movie . . . a little slow at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n ' t stop . i can see it is a good film and should be interesting , but the characters are all too dull . when we first saw this movie , i actually thought that it might have been more fun in one of those old western movies . it made me laugh to think about it , but if i was looking for an action - adventure novel , then i had to look elsewhere for one . it could have been even worse , especially since i am watching this film .|0
"In my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever. People started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People went nutty, demons were possessing people, all kinds of fun. Of course then it all went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the ""third testament"" in five days, but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy."|1
Let's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché, as Korean romance dramas and movies go. First of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. Second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.Still, I like this movie.Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--I honestly couldn't stop watching.|1
OK, so this is horror? I get horror - but I don't get horrific. Black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. It's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but I hope not. My question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. Well that's been done before too.|1
leslie carbaga ' s excellent book on the fleishers tells the whole story of the fleischer ' s big move of their characters to italy . it is one of the few stories i will ever write and it ' s not all bad , if you can believe it . the author of this story was a professor from the university of cambodia , and there were very few things that could be wrong with that . he left for college in december and went off to see his first lover . he wrote a lot of interesting novels and films , but i do not understand why they were made up in the first place .|0
` ` down periscope ' ' has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs . since then , we have not had much to do here , and now we have more time than i am used to . let me see if there is any connection between some of those books that you mentioned and a couple of things they were reading at the time . these books are very high - class , perhaps because they are written on a typewriter . so where did all this come from ? why was i thinking of them as novels ?|0
I attended a screening of this movie. It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? It obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. Nice thought to bank on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major miss. There was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best.|1
this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the , very protracted , end ! the only good thing that i can see on this movie is the sequel . it does not have a plot ( except in the movies ) but it still looks like a bad comedy . there is one interesting feature about the film , however , that i think you should hear from me . i do not believe any of the characters ' names are mentioned in the movie . i just hope the dialogue is all right . if it is not , i hope you find your way into the back and out again .|0
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit But when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene. i don even see why you would go to see it on your own.|1
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero.|1
"After an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on ""Columbo"". Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed."|1
i grew up watching the ` ` bowery boys ' ' on the weekends and even at young an age i could see it . i watched it in my spare time . i 'm pretty sure this movie was a lot different then , if i had to guess . but this is better . this is more fun . you can feel it when you have to turn it off . what do people really look like ? does anyone else notice this movie ? are any other kids watching this film ? there were no pictures or any other comments as to how it was done .|0
This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.The basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls.|1
as a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge jane austen fan , i was impressed . in the middle of it all , my dad took a call from the fbi , which meant they had been compromised by the u.s. department of foreign affairs . the fbi would like to see me right away . they are going to be coming to the united states this sunday , and if i do n't come now , i guess i will be late . however , there has been a change in plans .|0
i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies in its career . the plot is terrible ( though not too horrible ) and i can tell from the ending that there was a bit of evil going on . do n't get me wrong , it has all the good stuff in the world , but those two elements just are n't what i expected . the first part is totally unfair . the other part - my character 's name is really alice mccain - is awful .|0
how in the world does a thing like this get into my dvd player at home ? how does it make any money at all ? what can you do in a film that makes no money whatsoever ? ! this is so lame . seriously , if this movie is ever written , i will just never hear the end of it . i wish i could write something about it , though . it would be worth some money to have had the good sense to watch it . there has to be something better in this movie , especially with all the people involved .|0
"The setup for ""Nature of the Beast"" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Sort of like ""The Hitcher"" meets ""Psycho."" One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems!"|1
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in San Jose. It's a musical, which normally I don't like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q & A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany!|1
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off.|1
the worst movie i ' ve ever seen , and i ' ve seen allot . acting is horrible , plot is a bit lame , and the actors are like , totally clueless . it ' s all about making yourself feel good and doing things that are stupid but not really bad . the worst part is seeing someone you ' ve never seen ( or even known ) in any form other than what you were expecting to find in a tv ad . at times i don ' t even recognize them . there is no telling what sort of horror film could have produced something this terrible .|0
the love letter is one of my all - time favorite books , so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it . i do n't think i ever really knew the real story behind the book until recently . i believe the author was not only a very smart writer but also very talented , as well . there are many good writers in this world with an excellent writing ability , but that person has never come across a great writer . i would be too embarrassed to admit to you guys that i have been watching this movie since 2006 .|0
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha/Mostly Martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here.|1
` ` ahh . . . i did n ' t order no amazing hit show ' ' . . . . . ' ' we ' ll you got one ' ' . . , but they didn ' t think it was a bad idea to have a couple of young men from the other night come down to the pub and watch the shows on the tube . at any rate , it ' s a great comedy . there are n't that many people in hollywood who would pay $ 20 for an original piece of film by someone with a good mind .|0
"""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.The film concerns a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (Alan Curtis) run off and get married."|1
i love this movie . at first , i did n ' t expect much of this movie since i did n ' t watch a lot of cable . this is not what it looked like on dvd . i mean i watched a lot of movies in my life , but i didn ' t really get all that much to look at . the main reason i liked this movie is because there was no one else in it who wanted to watch it as much as i did . this is the first time i have seen a movie in my entire life .|0
"How sad it is when a film as wonderful as ""Jurassic Park"" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name."|1
The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. But the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. And, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers filmed mostly in Russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability.|1
this is just one of those films which can not justify much of anything that happens . these people are the worst ! we really have to get back into the movie . i need to find out what this is about so i can get on the screen , make a film , or even better , call the director and set it up . as you may know , i used to love to watch horror movies . they give me a chance to get away from my family for a while but i never wanted to do that . i thought it was such a waste of time .|0
"the movie existenz is about a futuristic video game on a ` ` pod ' ' system that is almost like virtual reality . for instance , it is supposed to be just an "" old school "" movie set by a guy who was once in love with his little girl . the play is very simple , but it is quite brutal and repetitive at the same time . it does not really have a plot , though i suppose that this movie was designed to give the impression of some kind of action adventure or sci - fi show ."|0
what a self - indulgent mess ! duncan roy ' s film is apparently autobiographical , however it ' s impossible to find any similarities whatsoever . i ' m pretty sure that the movie was based on actual fact . the characters are mostly in costumes and clothes . the main purpose of all this is to portray someone else who might actually enjoy their work . you would not be even remotely good if you didn ' t think you had a problem with it . i have to admit that for a movie of this type you would get a fair bit of entertainment .|0
i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was perusing the shelves at a small bookstand . however , in this story , there are not very many pictures that make it even remotely believable . why would the writer be doing this ? if you pay a lot of money and have a movie made that has people acting strange , then what makes it interesting is that you see some of the most famous films on the planet . for example , a few months back an actress who works at a movie house got caught up in the middle of filming one of those horror flicks they love .|0
i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr . who . i ' ve played them over and over again in my head . one of the best were , by far , the ones where there is no end - of - life drama , or an ending at all . it was not that bad for this movie . it just seemed to go on forever . even when it finally ended , only a few actors had the power to finish their film off . i did not think anything could move me so fast enough to stop me from being caught .|0
"i see that c . thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor and is very popular with the audience . so , why are they not expecting such a good actor to come forward ? what kind of show was it that brought this picture on ? if you asked me how i would have liked a more elaborate version of this movie , there would be no point in making one . just look at this one ' s premise . for starters , when i saw this movie i immediately thought : "" oh lord , this movie sucks ."|0
this movie is n ' t that great . . . at all but it ' s good when you want to just laugh , or even have something amusing to laugh about . in this version of the film , the characters are a bit different . the dialogue is different so the plot is slightly different , and there is some bad stuff going on , but most of it is completely normal . i found myself wondering if it would be better if one of the actors could do things like that . i never really got into what movies were originally intended for , so i guess it depends on who you ask .|0
"This movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld either."|1
Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization.|1
are you kidding me ? this is quite possibly the worst , amateur movie i ' ve ever seen . the only good thing about this movie is that it is one of those films with a lot of funny people who get killed in the movie and no one wins . when it is over we will never see such terrible characters again . do you know how bad it feels to be so much more important than everybody else ? what a waste of money ! i should have just bought a decent car for $ 200 .|0
"""The Moon Is Blue"" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" Whereas he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words ""virgin"" and ""mistress"" in his mild 1953 comedy ""The Moon Is Blue,"" Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" since Dick Powell made his law and order epic ""To the Ends of the Earth""(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics."|1
the toxic avenger . . . the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this film has been taken seriously , but they do not know how serious it is or what it means in any way other than to let people watch it . if it gets to the point where the director tries to put it in a play - by - play action , it just wo n't come . there are no plot lines for this film . we need a lot more time to develop and make sense of the film . . .|0
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? There is a scarecrow murdering people there. Only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. Whats the scarecrows secret? Will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK but picture is really corny. The plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical.|1
i loved the film ` ` eddie monroe ' ' . the film had all the components that kept me interested while the movie would not finish . i saw nothing of which was really interesting but what i got from my first experience with this movie was pretty much the same as watching it in a horror movie . the plot did not even seem to make sense and when i think about it , i just realized that if we did not get out of this house by tomorrow evening , i am sure we would find ourselves back in my mother 's bedroom .|0
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: There are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that I spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity.|1
this movie is funny if you ' re the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me ( repeating every word and making a lot of noise . it ' s a good film , i ' ve never seen it before and i like it because it ' s so full of love and hope . i ' m not really sure what the movie really is , but it ' s funny to watch anyway . i ' m not even sure if i want to watch the whole thing . i ' m kind of tired after watching it . maybe i shouldn ' t even sit down .|0
barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy , about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a girlfriend . it 's funny how things change so quickly and what is really funny when you see someone who is married ( or married ) has sex ! i could n't give a rat 's ass what those women look like , i just want to have a good time and enjoy the show . i ca n't think of a worse movie ever . there are too many bad jokes on the whole film for me to make any sense of it .|0
the core issues at play ( god & satan / good & evil ) can be & should be tremendously entertaining . i would like to thank my wife , who was on the scene before we came to this film . she enjoyed watching the actors come out of the shadows . you can see that as a small child this was one of the worst movies in the entire series . i do n't even want to say that it was the best movie ever made . i know it sounds corny , and i really wish that were true but there is a huge difference between having a big budget and being an active actor .|0
okay , anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film . a sophisticated film with some interesting twists is a good way to go about this film : if you care to look for more in the movie than it deserves , you might be willing to wait and watch a nice movie that wo n't get you too far . i do n't even really know where to begin . let me take you out to the restaurant and give you a description of how this was done - although i am sure i would have found out eventually if there was an actual movie .|0
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies even get onto DVD. If I saw this in theaters I would get extremely upset. Bone Eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. It's the 'Bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.First of all I thought okay well the DVD artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label it looked scary.|1
this is no walk in the park . i saw this when it came out , and have n ' t had a decent look at it myself . there are two characters in the film who are completely different to each other . one character is just a young man on vacation with a friend , but the other one does n't appear to be nearly that young . the guy appears to be about 10 years old . his friend looks much like he did before . the movie started off so well that i do n't know why the actors did it .|0
"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it."|1

"harlan banks is thief at the top of his game , but , after a successful career , he has to give up . this is not an unsuitable movie for someone in the financial community . as i was saying , "" we ' ve only got two movies that have been nominated , and it still looks like they ' re going to make the big one tomorrow . there ' s too many errors to take into account with the rest of us . let me point out that i can ' t remember the names of any of my major characters ."|0
This formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tightened.|1
"i must admit , ashamed though i am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror - chiller was not really one of my best ideas on the subject in general . unfortunately , it was made worse when i discovered a couple of bad guys were following me and trying to kill each other ! how could they ? this was not a bad idea at all . . . no kidding . i was so excited to see "" the show "" that i nearly started screaming out loud . after a few minutes i had gotten over my fear of the unknown and was actually enjoying it quite badly ."|0
"There is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure it was the teacher. In fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. I guess the point of that is that ""rape is omnipresent. You never know who it is going to be"".)"|1
"Why bother, ITV? Admittedly, Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to ""get,"" and Fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... If one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. And for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast Fanny as she was written: A prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! Mrs. Norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. And what the heck happened to Portsmouth?"|1
I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any, I've never rented any, so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker.|1
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film, it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege.|1
well , this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version . in the movie , it only seems to get better , as the story is not about what happened to a guy who had a crush on a girl . i would have expected more from an amateur comedy , but now i am impressed with them . we are at a loss for words . no - one really understands how a movie plays so many characters . this is the first film that was made in a long time without a director to direct the actors .|0
i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot . it is also based on a novel by some of the finest writers i have ever seen , and they are all trying to create a series that can make up for the fact that it never happened . the script is so lame it makes me wonder how anyone could write something so stupid . what does this movie even have to do with film ? there has to be an inconsistencies in every one of the scenes .|0
I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and I watched a video on it, so I was really into watching it. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like, I have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool.|1
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.|1
am an ardent vijay fan . i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this . it is not until we enter the second film that i decide to stop . it really sucks because there is so many people on the show ! the main characters are in their sixties , and do not look like someone who has only lived here for about one year . all the old - timer stuff is just wasted . a couple of times i watch the whole movie in my room with a big glass of whiskey to keep me from falling asleep .|0
"I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question.....Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yep....they do full meals too.Love the comment by the guy who hated the ""EVOO"" comment."|1
big fat liar , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . when you get a lot of good things from it , you ca n't help but think it 's completely insane . what a waste of space and resources . i 'm not saying this was all a bad movie . the people who actually had any interest in this movie had no interest in making it better than the original . it really just was n't that good . the only reason i even thought it would make this film was because i got a few comments on it .|0
I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher films on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films.To be fair, it started off OK, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods.|1
even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue the films . he was a brilliant writer , but when he got into trouble he just wanted to be on the street with the rest of us and would do whatever it takes to get back home . i always think of him as one of the greatest writers i know , because there are moments when i wish i could have seen that movie . why did n't he write it ? he must have thought he was going to win this prize at some point .|0
this ` ` film , ' ' and i use that term loosely , reminds me of the first joke my daughter ever made . she is not very funny , but she loves it . no one could give a damn about that movie anyway . as a little girl she was a big fan of the godfather , and her favorite part was when he used to go around with all these old movies on dvd . so if anyone asks where you live or if you can find a place for the movie in new york , ask your mother what movie you want to make .|0
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in a Sneak Preview, and left after half an Hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I., still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended.|1
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself.|1
there seems to be a spectrum of cinema . on the left , there are movies made mostly for entertainment purposes , but they do have their own theme . here , we see comedic and science fiction flicks , where people go crazy and try to fight each other for a piece of meat . on the right , there are films that are not even close to being anything close to sci - fi . the tv shows are not so much fun when you watch them , it seems as if they were made out of one person 's imagination .|0
the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast . the quality of the camera work makes it so much more difficult to capture their facial expressions and act . i mean , that movie has been a nightmare for these people . what do you do with a film about a guy whose girlfriend was kidnapped and then tortured by him in order to escape her captor ? how do you keep a girl from being killed or tortured by him ? this movie portrays an extreme sexual experience where the man gets involved in sex with his girlfriend . this film is really stupid .|0
It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa!Wow. What a skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.... Just some things to point out...1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I do need counseling now.2) There is no God, there is just Dude.. I love that quote from Crow.3) Whatever did happen to the Nuns that took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach.4) Lastly, don't watch this movie un-MSTied... It has Joe Estevez as the main star.. Yikes..1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.|1
Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging.There is, however, a flaw.|1
this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy , yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis teilhard . i would like to thank a lot of people who supported me in this film ( not just the ones who were in my home ) , for making it sound so cool . most of all , i love reading as much as they did and the idea of having a good film made by two people makes me want to read it more . also , there are plenty of other indie films which would make an ok movie for a young kid , but this was not one of them .|0
punishment park is a pseudo - documentary made by peter watkins . the premise is that the nation ' s dissidents ( hippies ? ) were just trying to give the country some time , but they never had any money , and have no idea what the right thing to do would be in a foreign country . i ' ve seen worse movies . if it ' s such an excellent film , how come so many of the characters seem to live out their short lives in one room , or in another part of the country ? well , i ' m not saying the movie has anything to do with them .|0
i have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now . i enjoyed the movie ' s story in a nutshell , so i was hoping this would be a memorable first installment . the main characters are great ; they are just a little off - putting in some areas . to make matters worse , their plot is totally off the top . i saw it on the website for one of the greatest movies ever written . there is a lot of dialogue in this movie that you can see with your bare eyes .|0
WOW!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be real stupid. No, this film is far more in common with The Thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) Lots of Carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood.|1
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure.|1
i guess this is the first time i have seen a roscoe ' fatty ' arbuckle movie . i really liked that movie and i had been looking forward to seeing it at least once . i remember when i was in junior high i would come home from work , walk to the living room , and get a cup of soda from the fridge while walking through my apartment . there were pictures of me and some of my friends playing baseball or sitting on the sofa , drinking beer and watching tv . other than that , i didn ' t know anything about the movie because it was just too boring .|0
gold raiders ( 1951 ) a dull western / comedy feature with the three stooges ( including shemp howard at this point ) . but the first part does look good . i also had a great idea for the plot , and that should have been enough of a surprise to be worth giving it all up . in fact , i actually wrote this one so i will leave out what i want you to hear . even though there may be a little something extra about the story , it is not quite the same as the other two - or rather , almost the same thing .|0
"assy mcgee is an out - of - control , hard - nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas . he finds himself unable to comprehend what has happened to his country or to anybody in it . not a single word of it can be shown on any television show that could ever be viewed as comedy . the movie is unreasonably long and almost all of the characters "" re - created "" in some way . they don ' t look very good when you see it , just like most other movies . there is one movie which seems to contain nothing but bad humor ."|0
"This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. ""subversives"" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted ""criminals"" are offered three days in ""Punishment Park"". Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie."|1
"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending."|1
any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in his pocket and got away clean . i thought , what would happen if i was the guy that wrote the book ? what would you do ? i really do think that this was a good book . i was never able to get anyone to help me because they just were n't as interested in helping me as they were in making an impact on the story . i remember some of the stories where the protagonists had a lot to say about their life outside of this book .|0
as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments : in was in mumbai about two weeks before the end of his first movie . i have seen it in all my movies , so i know what you are trying to say : do n't get me wrong , the film is interesting and it 's a great movie . but it does make a bad movie . how much longer am i supposed to watch that ? i thought it was just fun , but now i remember watching it in a horror movie about six months ago .|0
i ' ve read plenty of jane austen in my time and approve of several cinema / tv adaptations but this one we don ' t care to try out for at least 1 ( 2 ) because it is really a terrible thing to think about . there are no lines which would make any sense from the movie . the main character , whose name escapes you , looks like he ' s half - asleep , his head is on his knees and his mouth is hanging wide open . even though he doesn ' t sound very funny , i have to admit that the characters are very funny in their own way .|0
its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires . what does one do with desire in the midst of that ? it is , as i had hoped , utterly irrelevant at this point . there was nothing worth writing about . i have no interest in any aspect of my work . if you are looking to write a novel , make your own . i never did find a book i wanted to give a good reading to . it 's really just an excuse to get away on vacation , even though i am always getting bored .|0
"I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew ""stoners."" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two."|1
everyone has their choice for ` ` worst movie they ' ve ever seen . ' ' some like to pick on gigli ` s wife , who is the real villain of the show . it is a shame that none of them get to see all of the film . i just wanted to go to the beach in puerto vallarta . i am tired of being called a wimp by other people ! why is it that you never learn anything about yourself ? you always make excuses to get up and leave . how is it that you always manage to do something good but fail to accomplish your objective ?|0
a antique shop - owner in nyc , played by joanne whalley ( valerie alston ) gets put on a us district court case as she attempts to prevent this from happening . the whole affair is just so absurd i would like to think i have been able to cope when it comes to these types of movies , but instead i simply could not tolerate them anymore . although , there is nothing wrong with the plot at all . the characters , however , are obviously very predictable . i must admit , i thought maybe i should have made a little bit more of an effort to do something more useful .|0
anastasia : the mystery of anna was a two - part star studded historical t . v . movie based on the peter kurth film and made with the idea that it should be made in 1913 as a comedy / horror series . i ' m surprised there is one such thing ! the plot , characters , and background are all very familiar to me ; i don ' t even remember how many times i have seen it or what it is supposed to be like . this film does nothing for my feelings . i really don ' t care at all .|0
this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci - fi channel . here is an example of where the plot gets screwed when you think it should be good , but really is not ! well , maybe a couple of the funniest parts of this movie go pretty much as far as making a movie look funny in its entirety . i was able to take down most of the script before it was even finished and give it all a good review ( which was n't too bad if you know how to watch them ) .|0
the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an American of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?!|1
"If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the bowels of made-for-TV hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused ""docu-action"" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W ""rawcore"" footage. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming."|1
well , to each his own , but i thought gibson ' s hamlet was the most god - awful rendition i had ever heard . at first glance , this one looks like a bad version of george ford ' s movie . there ' s a lot of stuff on the soundtrack and i did not even get a chance to watch it last week because i got my ass kicked by some random guy who thinks he ' s in hollywood . that is another thing that can go on : people don ' t take any notice of their work .|0
inappropriate . the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa . whale rider has it right , but there are two of those on this show . i really liked the first one , because it is based on a romantic comedy about a teenage girl and her best friend who meet a boy in his hometown . however , they must have both fallen for each other ( or more like fall for him ) before they got married . unfortunately , this film does not make much sense to me . it lacks an explanation of the character .|0
i went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on vhs . i had to read the script , and then i knew that this movie was doomed from the start . you could tell what was going on when you saw the script . it was a very bad script . i am just not used to seeing this movie being directed by someone else . we got a bit of feedback in the first two scenes , but the overall ending was bad . i guess it was too bad because there was no mention at the beginning of the movie of what was really going down .|0
how did this film get into the berlin film festival ? i understand it got into the panorama section , but when you are in a cinema you must be in a large group . it was just like this movie , and that is why i really liked it , because it seemed to connect me to other films and also made them even more popular . however , not only did i not know what they were , i certainly did n't know how to write a novel . i wanted to do this with a lot of my own money , but i never thought it would end up in such a mess .|0
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life.|1
it ' s hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is , but i don ' t believe in wasting time on things like this . i have just enough time to pull out my laptop and get started on this story for the next few hours . what can i say about this film ? it ' s no better than those old movies where we ' ve heard of them , except that they are not nearly as funny or as much fun . oh , wait , you didn ' t know that there were actually two people watching this movie ?|0
"For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better ""display"" than some films in the shoestring budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole isn't the worst."|1
what i got was something better . just like many movies i ' ve commented on as of recently , i ' d been to the movies and i ' m not entirely sure what they are about . i found myself hoping that i might get some information from a movie - it ' s very hard to go through the motions with someone who is only half dead when he wakes up . but in the end , no matter how hard i tried , i still didn ' t have any idea what the movie was about .|0
"In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD's on ""junk"". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.The movie didn't really do it for me. The ""Good Guys"" weren't any more good than the ""Bad Guys"". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I just didn't care which side won."|1
"""Delusion"" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. The film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's B-movie diva Rubin's even performance. Don't waste your time on this turkey."|1
"My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. The movie ""Babas bilar"" must be just about the worst film I ever seen. I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper."|1
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and I think the script intended disastrous results.Lets start with the one thing I really did not like about this movie.... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this B movie.The best thing was John Rhys-Davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.|1
This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride!|1
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also The Floorwalker in this category.Charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.There aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator.|1
genius or utter madness ? that depends on your interpretation of this film . i responded to it on the internet but i thought it a comedy . i do not enjoy horror films . they make me feel like my whole life is being thrown into a cesspool . how many people are left in this world because of them ? the only way to tell what is really going on is to try and see for yourself . there is so much about this movie that i have not been able to digest . i just want to see it done properly .|0
when hulk hit theaters in 2003 , it was n ' t long before dvds of the old incredible hulk tv show came out . i found this too fascinating and i have to say it 's pretty cool . if you 've read some of the good shit that happens in this sci - fi movie , there is not much i would like about this movie ( and even fewer things i would like about this movie . ) the movie is just awful . the only thing that really makes this movie worthwhile is the fact that it has a plot that works .|0
"stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold - up , which is one of my favorite movies ever made ! "" "" how did this movie go ? "" scott asks . 
 "" it turned out okay ; i guess you can tell there were some good and bad parts . but , even though they were not bad , those things were just annoying to me . we had to watch them both before i could start to believe that there was some kind of connection between these two people . and i mean really !"|0
"""Graduation Day"" is a result of the success of ""Friday the 13th."" Both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film, I'd recommend ""Graduation Day."" If not, I wouldn't. There's nothing new here, just the same old killings.Even though I've given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say that it's not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative."|1
i saw this version about a decade ago , and have been looking for it ever since . i just wanted to take a good look at all these different versions of the story . so when i was bored i went to the library and picked up some movies . then one day there was this episode where the only reason that i did this is because my parents paid attention to it . i had taken the movie down to the basement level and read through it as if it really mattered . it was actually very dull .|0
Never having read or seen the Bard's original work, I can't begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.|1
that ' s all i can really say about this film . it ' s dbz . . . like tree of might and how to be the world champion at the end of the movie . i ' d love to see it with a soundtrack but my first idea was to do a new horror flick based on the book . i didn ' t get the chance until after the opening credits for this one so i don ' t think it will make a lot of difference . . . there is only one way to stop me from getting a big , fat ticket to see the dvd .|0
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place.|1
its difficult to be too tough on brad sykes , a hard - working guy doing what he loves , there is nothing better in the world . you just have to watch your back and hope it does n't come to that . this story was made up after a trip to an empty cabin in arkansas where a group of teenagers were all trying to get a rise out of a friend . i saw them through the door , not even bothering to close it behind me . as usual , the three of them ended up having very little to say .|0
a less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence . some northern idiots come across it as funny when they do n't think there should be any more to it . i was at school once and this is one of the few places where i can get a real idea of what he was talking about . you would never expect to find an entire class of actors , actors and actors living so well in these parts . the only reason i went to this high school was because i got kicked out of school for cheating on my first grade test .|0
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated.|1
there is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law . you think this is easy ? no , actually it is impossible . not only do you fail to believe in yourself and everything that you say , but your whole career is built on the idea that you will never figure out what makes movies tick . this was a very unoriginal script . i had to ask myself : did i ever see anything like this ? i could n't understand why they were making this movie so much .|0
'Don't Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. 'Don't' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd, disjointed, claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty, just plain grubby, for Brownrigg's world is this mad, unwashed, scummy prison cell of rants, obsessions and all shades of mental illness.|1
i went to this film full of hope . with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir gary , it just does not feel like one of the best movies i ever watched . the movie is basically a bunch of people trying to act normal and do everything normal as you might expect from a movie in that genre . i would like to say that there were a few times in my life where i have actually seen something like this before , but i could never really make it out as a movie .|0
"I'm not a movie snob. I've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here--""Galaxina"" is just substandard. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. ""Galaxina"" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard. ""Galaxina"" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called ""The Blue Star""."|1
. . . why watch a tv drama ( billed as a comedy ) in which none of the characters are likable ? i know what is funny , but my friends did not share that with me . let me tell you how this story is played out - first of all , there are two separate dramas that have to be co - existing on opposite sides of the screen and one has to be put on the wrong channel at every station . for example , cinemax is a really interesting show , especially since it is very well known that the actor is a gay guy , and that he is an easy target .|0
"I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I would feel morally remiss if I didn't disagree.Now, I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, ""He Knew He Was Right"" was absolutely horrendous. ""Carrie's War,"" however, is probably the best I've seen so far."|1
i thought this series was going to be another fun , action series with some dynamic plots and great performances . it could have been more interesting if it had just been a nice movie like that one we watched the other week . let me start by saying that there is something about movies that are always fascinating . the most entertaining of them all is the first scene that you can see on tv : the end of the film where an actor goes to the bathroom for a bit of toilet paper or wipes down the toilet . not everything is as boring as what happens in horror movies .|0
i love japanese movies - - having seen at least 100 - 200 . so it ' s obvious i am not afraid of a little scary action , but i suppose it ' s okay when you live in japan where you ' ve had to watch lots of horror movies before . they ' re a lot more scary than this . for some reason my mother was convinced that the monsters would be as scary as this movie is . i never really liked japanese films , and now i ' ve got to see them .|0
I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! Talk about so bad it made me laugh!Firstly, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, I couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what I was seeing. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff.|1
I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case.|1
. . . but you probably have seen it or else you would n ' t be here . it ' s so obscure that i can not even tell if what i saw is still in its proper place . it is an odd sight , especially for those who have no clue what they are looking at , but i am not surprised that this has been left out . as usual , i didn ' t know how to make a decent movie of it , so i had to make a great one . i found myself watching it from the time i was 12 years old when i first started seeing it .|0
This movie was so poorly acted. What was with Jeff Bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian?The script was lame. To have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the Jeff Bridges character...are you kidding me? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. Do these people just not believe in calling the cops? Okay...I'll get into the car with you, why not? DUH!|1
jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he ' s a great actor ( eternal sunshine ) who can make a joke out of anything , but this is just another one in a series . his movies are so funny that it ' s almost insulting . the fact that he is still alive at all does not go unnoticed by me or my friends ; they have already started to speculate about why such a mediocre movie was chosen . as some of us were wondering , what made him choose this film ? i had no clue , other than the fact that there was something wrong with this movie .|0
"This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the Latin American countries, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a ""dog eat dog"" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a ""no frills"" approach, this movie will get to you, Great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection."|1
"If you were enjoyed by watching ""Guinea Pig"" - then you'll like this movie to! ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. Actually the effects are not so realistic like in ""Guinea Pig"", but its still pretty gory. ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. After that you'll see fetish sex scenes. And last one is a torture scene."|1
in london , the venetian carla borin ( yuliya mayarchuk ) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved brother , his fiancée . she thinks that they have a real chance but has no idea what kind of possibility there is to try . if you would like to read more , please do your research here . it may be a while before you can make any connections on the subject . this is a book that i found in one of the local libraries and thought was very interesting , although it is probably not as popular as many others .|0
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. He hides out in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles.|1
what can i say . . . not much to this one at all . pretty dull and uninteresting . the actors performances are boring . it looks like i should know that , do n't you ? well , i guess i do n't . i 've got an idea or two for a play that could work , but i have n't written any of the names . . . maybe i should be grateful that i found my way here so quickly . . . why did everyone make it so easy to figure out their plot ? . . i really want to write some stories about my childhood .|0
"this movie is an example of small budget , ineffective star cast , weak storyline and poor entertainment . this movie is a joke at best . i ' ve seen many films in my life , and the acting is great , but the actors have no character , no sense of humor . this movie can be summed up as a "" bad script "" with about half the words in it . the first part of this series has only one story line : some of the people who work for the film , and most of them are amateurs ."|0
while i hold its predecessor , ` ` fast times at ridgemont high , ' ' as a standard to which other kids are born . . . . and this was the case with my first film . it showed a series of characters from another generation who lived on the same farm . the story was so simple that i thought it could have been made any movie in the history of our nation . all i wanted was to watch some good old american movies that would last awhile . but by the time it was over there had been enough excitement for one night .|0
"there are so many holes in the plot , it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience . this is too much ! "" i yelled as i jumped out of bed and went to my laptop . i opened up a new page and started typing some questions . it was probably a good idea because i did not think i could actually write anything by hand , but i felt pretty confident about being able to put one on the board . the question that came first was : what would they do to me when they got hold of this ?"|0
Wow... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now. To say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love.When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide I figured it would be a spoof... maybe it should have been. Could have made for a better movie.Look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever. They could have sprung for a fan at least.Look for several Canadian & c-list actors in the movie.|1
it ' s not fair . i was really expecting this to be a hilarious , entertaining movie . i mean come on ! this is a stupid movie , and there isn ' t a line in sight that says we have to watch it . the only thing i could think of at this point was that i ' m stuck in the middle of some idiotic film . why is this boring ? i spent my last few years watching it with my father , and he never understood any of it . but then again maybe he didn ' t either because he didn ' t care .|0
i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on ` ` mystery science theater ' ' have received a short cut and a very large - screen . the main thing is that it does not always work . there are only a few moments in each movie which can be recorded on an old - fashioned tape recorder , and that is usually enough for me to spend hours watching . i had watched this film so many times in the past that it became second nature to me . when i was a youngster , i never even knew the name of the movie .|0
i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies . but there are very few that i care to watch because i think we all know how it ends . so , i can tell you now that this movie was actually the first one in history to end up like this . this is what happens when people become actors . they just go back to pretending to have some kind of real experience , while their life and their career fall apart at the seams . this movie is a total letdown for any decent comedy in the world and it has gone on long enough .|0
This is a fantastic film. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching it, I could see parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece.|1
all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters . this is city - wide , and it is a very good story . it also tells you what you need to know about the film . well , i think we have had a long day . i am really tired from the drive , so my eyes want to close , but i ca n't . i would like to read one of these in an hour . just to get the feel of the movie , there may never be another single thing to do for the next two hours .|0
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.The Good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about Theresa ChanThe Bad :The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No linkage between the 3 story lines. Minimum DIALOGUE in the film, substituted by SMSs and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.|1
susan sarandon . she made this movie for me . i ' ve never appreciated her acting more than as i did that night . it ' s one of the reasons i wrote it . well , first and foremost , i hope i can find a good writer who knows how to play the part of an editor . secondly , if you think it ' s going to be fun , then go ahead ! there are a few directors who would love to have their own little book . i wouldn ' t care much for such a thing , but it ' s worth looking at .|0
wow ! here comes another straight - to - video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy . if the cheap - looking opening credits for the show do n't work , get back out on the street before you 're fired . and just so 's i can enjoy that film as a sequel , please take a peek at the first three or four episodes . i hope you enjoyed it in general , but this should have been more of an experience than any i have seen before . thank god for movies with a good content ( yes , they were awful , but we made them ) .|0
this movie was pointless . i ca n ' t even call it sci - fi , since that requires more from a movie than actual fact . my first reaction is to be embarrassed for the movie , but then again , i ' m used to these types of issues . when i was little i thought it was all so boring . what if they actually have an entire trilogy and you just watch it ? well , there are a number of interesting things in this movie . first off , let me admit that i wasn ' t impressed with the way it turned out .|0
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH."|1
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in Aberdeen.1st off Im not a big Sci-Fi fan (baring Star Wars) I was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, I was presently surprised.|1
watched this film at a local festival , the silver sprocket international film festival florida . what a lovely film and one i ca n't wait for to see in person . not because i am an idiot . i am a fan of that film , but i never really believed that it should have come from the top of the list of movies that people will watch on tv . so , here i sit watching this movie and i can not believe my eyes . . . there she is , all alone with her brother and his family .|0
This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.Some matches were a complete waste of time.|1
"This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All of it, sucked. Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog, such as ""how ya doing?""..."|1
"my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! ""dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes"" and ""dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again."" what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality."|1
"seems to me that joe estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother .

 "" you could find a nice person to take your place as director of the new production , "" don juan suggested . "" i have some experience with film making ."|0
"I too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to ""The Outer Limits."" The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw."|1
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.|1
"This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on. But, I'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like ""The West Wing"" or ""Commander-in-Chief."" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in ""Early Edition""). It was a pain to sit through this show."|1
"frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after a three - hour binge . it is quite interesting and i like this part , so let me just go on with it . here goes : 
 if you are looking for an answer to the question that is asked by a stranger , do not pay any attention to the questions . in order for you to understand this story , it is necessary to understand what happens in these situations or they will never be solved ."|0
The cinematography is the film's shining feature. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there's a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. It's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight.|1
"This version of ""The Magic Flute"" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera that I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have seen of any opera.I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He is just dressed like some guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVD's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one."|1
"Seriously I don't get why people are all like ""Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!!!"" It's a bunch of junk! The acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. The music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well."|1
i saw the world premiere at the toronto international film fest , this is a great film . real - life husband and wife getting together in a pub to have a glass of wine ? really ? it could n't get better : the two of them meeting in a club , sitting down on a cheap leather couch , making out with their friends and having one of the most intense , sexual encounters of my life . i ca n't even believe how far we have come . i actually had no idea it was possible to have such strong sex in a place where only one person can do it .|0
1) Bad acting.2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.3) Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows up so early. The escape ship also got sunk too fast.|1
wow , i swear this has never happened to me before . i only watched ` ` golden temple amazons ' ' on mtv in the early 2000s . i am hoping to see something similar from this movie . my first question is , what were they saying when they took this movie ? oh yeah . it just started out so well , that was pretty lame . after a few minutes of making comments about their character , i found myself wishing there was an award for most of her choices . yes , she had good music , but i really wanted to get to the bottom of this guy .|0
This is a magnificent, and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy, with my throat almost strangled with tears, and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD.Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.The fiancé, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic.|1
i absolutely love the first three movies , they were great ! i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 . and i ca n't even tell you how badly i wanted to do it , i could not concentrate in class and my teacher had a terrible voice . this film is the most boring thing i have seen in years . there are so many characters and dialogue . but the best part is just watching the two people in the movie who are the only one that understands each other better . of course i really did watch it , but i am not as good at making conversation as my mother or dad .|0
"a virtual carbon copy of the cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot . in some ways this is not too bad , but i find it very slow moving and repetitive . i think the plot is really just a bit lame .

"" "" well , first off , there are n't that many movies in the movie . they were originally made for a documentary but have become somewhat outdated as time passes ."|0
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie.|1
"Yah. I know. It has the name ""Sinatra"" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this thinking it was some movie I missed in the theaters. It's not. It's some garbage ""movie"" made by the folks at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! It's not good. I am as big a Sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb."|1
wayne wang ' s direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than ` ` slums of los angeles , ' as it so obviously is . here , you can ' t even begin to imagine the amount of trouble that ' s had with the media in order to find out who did the shooting ! i would like to have seen it when i saw it last . it ' s not particularly hard to see why an artist might want to create this masterpiece , considering how many of my favourite artists were actors or musicians .|0
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. I've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.The acting's all good and the direction very solid. The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?|1
"I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of ""Grand Champion"" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her images were used for PR."|1
as a rule , i try to find as much in films as i possibly can to enjoy them . the more i watch , the more i see what i have written , and the more i feel this is the best shot i 've ever had . it really makes me wonder what sort of person would spend all these years creating this movie . maybe he or she is not good at this kind of stuff , but i do n't think they are that good at it either . i ca n't believe this is real !|0
'The Shining' has wit, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Ausentes,' however, has none of these things; although it does borrow from its classic forebear; to wit, a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, 'Ausentes' is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically awful; it makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art.|1
'Carolina Moon' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. Turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset.|1
this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous . although he is quite grown up , it has also been noted that he always seemed to have an excuse for being there . one of the reasons he was not in high school was because he spent almost as much time in the halls as he used to . however , with the addition of such an excellent story , he managed to get through the semester unscathed . i did notice how his eyes followed the entire film . i thought it was a bit weird that he still had the same interest in it .|0
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots. (In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).Mani's class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever... Maddy,who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too.|1
i recently rented this promising mini series , i did n ' t even know they had adapted it for television . the plot was just one big horror flick with none of the characters . i 'm sure you think it 's quite amusing , but it was not . the plot was basically the same as when i purchased it at the bookstore in new haven . there is very little romance in the movie . i loved it so much that i bought it because my parents always used to make fun of how much money the movie makes each year .|0
"Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. This film does not. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, ""I don't remember sending for room service"". The main entertainment value is in its badness; I recommended my local video story put it on the ""Turkeys"" shelf."|1
the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i ' ve seen a duff film . i think he ' s using it as an excuse to make fun of me for something that happened in 1992 or 1990 . i just ca nt figure out what it would be like to watch a movie that ' s filmed in 1956 . i know , i know , i have never seen one of the films and they have not yet made it onto the dvd menu . how many times can you go without having to watch any of the other movies that were released in the last decade ?|0
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true.|1
River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of American youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.Much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.This unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in American society.Those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast.|1
"When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here.One of the other users commenting on this states ""This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart"". I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is ""classic"" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality."|1
stmd ! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low - budget films i ' ve seen in quite some time . i ' ve watched it over a dozen times at various scenes throughout the movie . this is the first film to be released in 2012 , and i thought the best thing for it all would be to go out on the road and see something else . but i ca ' t seem to shake the feeling that this will lead to an endless string of blockbuster movies being shot and edited . i mean , how can any of these people possibly be capable of producing anything other than crap ?|0
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . Drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . Hey I think I`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE EVER SEEN or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX EVER SEEN . Oh hold on I`m not married and I`ve never been on honeymoon !|1
firstly , i am a huge fan of crap films . b grade is always good for a laugh . b grade does have a certain appeal and this is not it . one of the reasons i liked these movies was that they are so original . they can make you laugh ; at least their portrayal would be believable . the fact that this film could have had an impact on a world in which people still believe that god exists has been greatly exaggerated . the only real improvement from what happened last sunday was the fact that the film made a complete change to its original theme : it has a more upbeat ending .|0
i ca n ' t believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on imdb . of course , they have n't seen this movie yet , but i don ' t understand why anyone would do such a thing . i mean , we all know how hard it is to make movies as good as this one , right ? and anyway , they are only doing it for the money , not so that they can watch it . maybe they just want to watch the film in private . what the hell ? these people are really stupid .|0
This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead.|1
"There is a difference between a ""film,"" and a ""movie."" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski's ""Donnybrook."" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the ""finished"" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie."|1
i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say : i was not impressed , not at all . for the first time , i actually got the feeling that there was a lot about this movie that was different from those on television . it did n't really make much sense or look like something you would watch before going to sleep . how could one show such great movies and then change it in a matter of seconds ? the only reason i ever watched this movie was because i thought it was very funny .|0
i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it . so charming and so funny that even though i was the last one to read it , i wanted to laugh out loud . the whole thing had me laughing so hard that when i finally managed to stop , i dropped my camera and got a few minutes of quiet time in the library before i decided to take a break . there are only a few people on the main floor of the library who go to the movies like they have been here before . the other two guys that work here are n't as good .|0
this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old . robert sacchi nails his wife ( who , after having just given birth to three children in a row , he had no more time left in the world ) into the role of an actor in a movie i never saw . i did not really want to watch this so i tried to get it off my mind . however , on the whole , it was pretty bad . the characters are incredibly attractive , even if they do look rather unattractive .|0
this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers , if garbage could ruin motion picture careers . not to mention the one thing that i think makes it more believable is the guy you see in a movie who is acting really good . the first part of this film was very good . and the actors were decent . i never thought i would watch this film with another person , but i had hoped that it would be a good one . there was no point in making an attempt to get a plot or anything . it just did not go as i expected .|0
This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. But the sex isn't even arousing. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat.|1
i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought , despite not even having known it . the film looked like something that you see in a magazine - only better . but it is basically the same . i did n't know it was supposed to be a movie but i could never figure out how to change it from the original . i guess that i am too smart to realize that there must be another category . i think i was born into this world because i have always had a big problem understanding what is going on between people .|0
Really? Is this necessary? How can somebody make such a film? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the Ending. Completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood!!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car persecution, and I know he can't act.|1
first of all , let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject - a very special case is unfolding in front of us . you will love this film , as there are plenty of good characters to share it with . how do i know these are not real too ? ok , here we go , for example , about a man who lives in an old country house in the middle of nowhere . his wife leaves him and they move out of their home because he ' s too poor to care for anything else .|0
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years, (I loved the Brothers McMullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. Furthermore, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's direction, was art. The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool.|1
This is the worst of the toxie series by far. The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. Like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. Why is this film made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. There's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop.|1
every time i see a film like this i get sick to my stomach . when i watch a movie like this , i think it is because i love the story that has always made it interesting . you can not believe that i had any idea that such a movie actually existed . i did n't even know about the plot and it was just awful . there is no rhyme or reason as to why the movie is so awful . if you are not interested in being entertained , you have to be content watching it on a regular basis .|0
"Well, after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theatre expecting something big. Boy was I disappointed. First of all, the characterizations in the film are SO weird! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgarly shot ""Maaja Maaja""?"|1
"I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. I remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family.Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like ""this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid..."|1
This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn't heard about before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It's a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years.|1
for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ( ` ` like , why does he show so much interest in it ' ? ' i do n't know ' ? ) . i personally saw this movie when i first bought it , but i did n't have a clue as to the reason why it was originally set up . i can only assume that the author must have had more than enough time with the editing and editing to make it suitable for such an unglamorous film , but you never know what you might stumble across if you find it .|0
"""Nicodemus"" is almost a copy of ""Red"" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it's way into Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects Jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however Clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is Lana."|1
Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age.|1
"i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo . it is of my opinion that the "" bad guy "" would have had at least some sort of fun while he was in the story but i could not find a thing wrong with it . it is very disturbing . the way the characters and dialogue seem to come together from all sides is rather odd . i do not know what is so funny about it . it does not look like you are laughing hard enough , as if you were just having fun ."|0
i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films . however , i found no pleasure in the show when i watched it as part of my program . since i got to watch it for the second time i have never had to make a choice . there has to be some middle ground . perhaps this is a good time for me to try to decide on what to do . i find this story hard to believe . first of all , this is a stupid movie . we are filming a comedy about a group of people trying to get revenge on their enemies .|0
set in hungary in november 1956 , this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to get some kind of deal with someone called ' the mysterious ' . this book was n't particularly exciting ( although it did make me curious what this person could possibly want with them , but i ca n't imagine why they should be anything else ) . for obvious reasons , all three novels contain similar scenes - the one from 1963 , the one from 1977 , and the one from 2003 . at the time of the book , they both appeared on a variety of major film covers .|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin.|1
"i love this show . it ' s clever and very well acted . david morse and andre braugher have great personalities - they both make up a good film , especially when you ' re the best person to watch it with . however , neither one of them are really good in any of the films . i would not say "" bad "" is accurate but if you like the movies you ' re never going to win an oscar or get caught out . it ' s quite easy to tell that some of the worst comedies in history come from the same country as the movie ."|0
"this is a cult classic for sure ! ! it is tricky to follow at times , but then again i can find the plot quite fascinating . some of the characters in this trilogy seem like they have never been married , and yet there is plenty of material that makes me wonder how many more people are in the area . i also notice that every time i review the movie i look on the screen thinking , "" this is just perfect . so what am i missing here ? maybe this is my one lucky break after all , i wo n't be haunted by ghosts or anything else .

Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The story-crap The acting- crap(Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The plot-crap The subplot-garbage The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junkI have vowed to watch Romy and Michelle's High School reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes.|1
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!|1
i liked this movie , the second naruto feature film . i enjoyed the one in the snow a tad more too , but that was not enough . it took all night and for hours before i fell asleep . when i awoke , the lights were out and the show was on . i went downstairs to the kitchen to make some cereal , but my mouth was dry so i decided to get something to eat . after a couple minutes i heard the front door open and close . a minute later i heard someone enter the living room .|0

This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look.|1
this tough - to - see little picture played at the mods & rockers 2007 festival . it is a wonderful and loving look , especially since the music is so loud . most of the songs on the ' tape ' are not in the original script . i hope we can still find something that will make me happy . the only thing that keeps me interested in listening is the story of adam wilde . i am really disappointed in him . i did not have the heart to play this movie with one of the greatest artists in new york .|0
An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one isn't like any other as it pits pint-size, wild-eyed, psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots.|1
except for the glossy look , this show had little to recommend it . the writing was patronizing and convoluted , but there was nothing else out there to be done on a film set with that kind of technical jargon . i 'm sorry , i did n't know you were going to have a very nice opening tonight . let me see , why do n't you make a movie about a boy who works at a garage where he puts all his tools in a truck and takes them out into the country to build a big factory ?|0
boring as hell and kind of a chick flick . it ' s the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the need to survive in her own family , and is trying to save the people around her from some dangerous situations . i think you already know this . now i have to say something about this : when i was younger , i would go out to the movies with my friends for the weekend . we went to a movie festival and got eaten alive by an animal that was very hungry . what a fun time !|0
i have just caught this movie on tcm , and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this film is a total waste of time . but there is something really wrong with me that i am not able to fix . in the end it has all ended and i do not feel that i ever had the courage to write another review of this movie . it is an absolute shame that i never got to see this movie . i was too young to watch it when i first saw it . so no thanks . maybe someday i might watch it , but right now i ca n't make it any longer .|0
if you have ever shopped at wal - mart , then you probably know about the $ 5 dvd bin that sits in the corner of the store . this is the movie where the heroine finds a box full of condoms to use as weapons . this is one of the few movies where the heroine does not get shot on sight . unfortunately , there was no way for her to pull out the bullets and make them stop . she only got six shots in . most of the actors are dumb , so none of them had the balls to act like an ass * * le .|0

A beautiful film. One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed. Made me think about death but not fear it, think about life but not hide from it. A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell. A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost, but no sadness graced my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony!|1
"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"".The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins."|1
contains major spoilers , on the off chance you would actually care about the story line . ok , we have storms at the moment , which are just as bad as in other episodes . i was thinking of taking this movie home for christmas and buying it for the next season . no problem . but what is a christmas movie when you get a new movie to take over ? i did not think it was possible to learn all of these things from one movie , and i really wanted to . i also thought it would be nice if i had time to work out an idea .|0
this film requires a lot of patience . because it focuses on mood and character development , the plot is more like a movie you may find at a store where people are looking forward to seeing how happy their loved one will be with the new love story . as a writer i had no problem trying to see what other characters were feeling or wanting . but i wanted to get back to some real - life things so that i could keep thinking about the movie . i wanted to have a good laugh at its most ridiculous ending .|0
i ' ve been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and ca n ' t seem to do it all . i ' m going to start here , which is a total of about forty - five minutes . there is a lot of stuff in this diary that i don ' t know what to make of . after reading the original manuscript , i decided to see if i could re - create a scene from the previous year . i didn ' t like what i saw . i wanted to get out of there fast so i left the theater and walked around aimlessly with my head down .|0
when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island , they soon find that their new identities have been altered . the only people who know the identity of the fugitives ' accomplices are two women and a boy . i am certain that these women will make a good movie , but i never saw the film myself . so what does it matter ? after witnessing the film , i did not need to view it at all . there was just something very wrong with the way it played out . it is as if the director has put his finger on something he ca n't quite explain .|0
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch.|1
In America, the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. A few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find Augustine, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of Jonathan's family.|1
Well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. If that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.If, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with HUGE cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so hard I nearly cried.|1
There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part.|1
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.)|1
"i think the ` ` bone snatcher ' ' should go after anyone associated with this movie . watching this will seem to be one of them . "" "" yeah , well , maybe he has some ideas , "" bob said , "" just do n't let me down . "" "" thanks , "" mike said . "" i need to call a meeting . i 'm sure we can work out something for you if you are willing to meet with us . "" "" i have no intention whatsoever of meeting with you guys today . i am so busy that i am not seeing what i saw ."|0
"how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me . the test that postal workers take to find out what 's in the mail ? it 's awful . not at all funny . no one knows what they are really doing , or if they even do have an idea . when i see a box with the words "" garbage "" written on it i start freaking out and try to pick up the boxes but then i just give up after about five minutes . there was nothing in this box that would cause me to actually be interested in having a conversation with this guy !"|0
"i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...""thing"" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get ""The Nun"".And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!"|1
i ' m the first to recognize that chan - wook park ' s thirst is exceptionally well made , but spending over two hundred thousand dollars for a movie which cost more than my average salary can afford just is n't my strong suit . i love this film because it plays on an entirely different level from the rest of the films i have seen in the years that i have sat at these seats . this movie may be a waste of time , but it is also a good one . let me begin by saying that i love the movie .|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
I'm a Christian, and I have watched pretty of Christian movies, but this one is too bad. They try to make this good, but it's too hard for them I think.- You can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. I think there will be a lot more of them.- The quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. The story is not so very bad, but could've been better.|1
"With its rerelease by ADV Films, I've had a chance to watch ""The Giant Majin"" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!The sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant Majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!"|1
"This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring ""looks-like-a-suspens"" scenes.Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of ""hello's"" and few ""hang on"" on the 1st part.Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters."|1
this film is good in it ' s genre and that genre is naturally action with a little / average budget . looks great for a film , but i have to take it seriously at times . first of all , when i first saw this movie , i was shocked . i never thought anything could be so interesting as this . the characters were believable ( if there was such a word ) , but the content was completely out of the ordinary . they just do n't relate to any real person or movies at all . they actually seem to be trying not to make eye contact with anyone who enters the theatre .|0
i attended a screening of ' the cooler ' at the toronto film festival this year . while the other reviews were a little less favorable , it was certainly one of the finest films i have ever seen . you can see from the first few chapters that the film was somewhat boring . however , there was still something about it that made me feel very uncomfortable . every time i sat down to watch the movie , it just would n't go away . then again , i thought maybe they only had bad taste in films .|0
well i ' m not the world ' s biggest sondheim fan , so although i have the cast album and i have a good lead , i ' re not in the market for making films that are too big to make a decent tv / movie . this show is a failure compared to what we get here . it ' s such a waste of time . but you know who i am ? i won ' t say i was looking forward to this movie , but i certainly wasn ' t about to watch it as an example of how bad it ' s portrayal of movies .|0
this show is terrible . i can not get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains . it does not look as bad as one might expect . in fact , i found it so awful that i was glad to have a show and go out and buy a few extras . i guess there is something good about a horror movie . i mean , we were all very surprised by the entire thing . well , if you ca n't see what you are going to miss out on , i hope you can enjoy it for a little while longer .|0
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. It fails at the first post by not being scary OR funny. It is a dull grey movie that I guess went straight to video. Hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school level script. Zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores.|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. Only living. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. To see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the movie, are desensitized.|1
"I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I found NO enjoyment in this movie. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. It is definitely not in the same category as ""The Cave"" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made."|1
"When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento."|1
"...means ""take up and read"", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.Watch out for this young director...he's going places."|1
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered through to the end... However, this is not a programme I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as I don't think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found the acting to be, at times, poor.|1
this movie was everything but boring . it deals with reality . to the people who think this movie was funny , they are disappointed that one of the characters does not even seem to have any kind of character . and then there 's the story line : if you love what you see , i hope you will never watch a movie again ! oh , my god , why did this make me go to prison for life ? first of all , do not tell anyone i just watched this film . it really is the worst version of the movie on earth .|0
a traveling couple ( horton and hamilton ) stumble onto the town of gatlin , where kids have slaughtered the townsfolk with their own shotguns . what are they going to do with them when they finally get out ? i do n't think they have an easy way to kill off a bunch of zombies . as long as you keep your gun pointed at one , it is difficult to tell how bad things are really . i had no idea that this town was so dangerous . i just wanted to see if anyone from around here had seen anything remotely like it .|0
"This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. Isn't there something a little hypocritical there? The scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite."|1
the slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that was supposed to have been hilarious and not like a movie . i thought that maybe it was just a little too close for comfort over the last few months . this show is really bad at all times and most of the people that are left in it have gone out of their way to enjoy it as much as they should . if you do n't know how bad this show is ( well , you can bet your ass that you will ) , then it is going to be pretty sad .|0
"I don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...Fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies I've ever seen. Not sure what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with ""Scream""?"|1
If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. At all.4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6.|1
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong, wait and see.|1
honestly , this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting ( heather graham could never find anything funny ) . it is also the funniest movie i have had ever seen . first of all , i am an idiot ! as i sat there with the two girls in their late teens and early twenties , talking about how great they think this movie was , i knew i was going to regret letting them watch it . however , the only way they would not be disappointed in the end would be if i watched the whole movie .|0
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ...|1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this one out. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.In this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system.|1
I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well.|1
there were nice characters in here , played by pleasant - looking actors and actresses , plus it had a famous band that i thought was kind of funny . at least this film is interesting to watch when you are playing for fun , like this show . but this character does n't even have a plot yet . i got the impression she was just bored out of her mind , so i felt sorry for anyone who wanted to get to know her better . maybe i should have watched this movie with her ( i could see why she likes it ) .|0
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. Obviously this isn't intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about £20 to make.|1
i ' m a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising a . k . a . not only do they sound as if they mean something , but they ' ve got the most amazing voices that make you feel like this song is on fire . so , why should anyone else buy this for me to watch ? well , it really doesn ' t matter because i have no idea why . i just know that this book will be my greatest fan and i want to read every single word about it . how can this book possibly have any meaning whatsoever to a human being ?|0
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of ""The Comebacks"" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks"" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie."|1
excerpt from tv guide : this week on the love boat , captain stubing has his hands full when a girl finds out she had her heart ripped out of her body by a handsome young man . he says that he 's not interested in doing it again and that he wants to help her find her happy ending . but there 's only so much one can take in one lifetime . i got ta say , this movie definitely has a bit of an action / adventure thing going on ( as far as i can tell ) .|0
"i saw this film at the 3rd adelaide international film festival at the palace cinemas , and was totally switched from one thing to another . how did it go so wrong ? there should be a movie going around about now if it 's still in sitar . ' ' oh , well , that certainly depends on what you 're saying , ' theo replied . 
 ' i thought it was a very good movie . the actors were nice , their acting was decent , they seemed to get along really well , even though they knew each other for only a few hours ."|0
i really like the show ! ! as a part of greek life , i can say that some things never change . not all the people who see the show will believe it ( although some will have their doubts ) , but many of them wo n't believe it in the end . anyway , i am so glad you like this one . i have always been very interested in movies from the 1960s to the 1950 and i still enjoy watching them . they are wonderful . the film is quite interesting with a much more realistic plot element .|0
i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film . i decided not to watch it . this is one of those rare occasions when it is the first time for me to really watch the same movie with the same results . no matter who made it , as long as there is something funny in it , i ca n't say that it is a great movie , or even quite amusing . it is so bad that i have to try very hard just to stay out of their sight .|0
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits.|1
this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the moulin rouge dance hall . in many ways , this is a masterpiece of an amazing work of art , but for some bizarre reason they have done nothing on that part of it . let 's not get carried away here . when we got to the opera house and i asked steve to show me how he did that , he answered that he could do whatever he wanted with the music . it would be much cheaper if you just gave it to him , instead of trying to find out more .|0
the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile . jolie ' s acting is pretty flat and i was thinking it might be a good production for a screenplay if it did n't go out of style . so what ? we can just skip ahead and let that movie sink in and maybe make some changes . you want to watch a film like this ? do you actually want to see a film like this at all ? how about someone else watching it with your own set of eyes ? i bet they ' ll agree with me .|0
Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view.|1
This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much.|1
neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by planetbollywood . its hard to believe that any of these movies ever made it out of production . you will surely see some of the funniest film clips in the last 24 hours . the plot is so ridiculous and unbelievable , i do not really know what to think when i first read about it . for all i know , this movie has gone down in a few short months . why would they waste time with this rubbish ? maybe it was just a way to pass the time . who knows ?|0
This movie was so awful that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of trash. I couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. He doesn't just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. He even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything I have ever seen. I couldn't believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early '80's or something.|1
the ` ` silver screen ' ' gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life ' s rainbows . that is just a big old joke . you do n't have to be a movie director if you do n't enjoy being a movie director . even so , it makes no difference to me . i am still in awe at the fact that there is an endless stream of films from all over the world who can make a good one . it has to be worth money , but i never had any expectations that it was possible to make a bad film .|0
there are not many films which i would describe as perfect , but rififi definitely fits the bill . no , my favourite film in this movie is black hole . well , actually , what you saw was very good , but it seemed to be the most awful movie i ever saw . i mean , why could n't someone have chosen that other movie ? i was really looking forward to spending the rest of my saturday afternoon with my girlfriends and having some fun . they had all gotten together at a pub one night and just listened to the music .|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the Bone Eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date.|1
set in the philipines , lethal panther 2 is a dreary early - 90s martial - arts action flick which sees a reckless cop trying to escape an unknown killer . we all saw the movie and knew it was terrible . unfortunately , that did n't last long . this film has always been my favorite because i have loved this story . it is about a girl who gets a job at a high - school and goes to work at the local pizza place . it seems that she has a little crush on the handsome quarterback who is very popular with girls .|0
if you just want gore , and nothing but gore and torture , you ' ve come to the right movie . in fact , i was surprised by how much it actually is . for a moment i thought this movie was a lot better than the previous one . maybe i should try to find another movie . why do people always say there is no fun in anything ? it has been a real waste of good movies . here ' s hoping someone will buy them . i really would like to read something about this film that may be useful to me .|0
I've watched the movie actually several times. And what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. Not even those silly model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... Burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. Even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too.|1
8 / 2008 . when i originally wrote my comments , shortly after first seeing this film , i took a critical view of the scene and decided it was a bad idea to make any comment about what is happening in the film . however , something has changed for me on this subject and i did n't like it at all . even worse , i could see that i was wasting time reading the book or watching the recording as well . the main point in this movie is that they ' re doing some serious acting , but there is a sense of humour in it that really just embarrasses me .|0
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery). He hooks up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!).|1
another first : this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer . perhaps i ' m a bit biased , but it ' s a good story . in addition to being a well - known american film star , eric rohmer is not a very tall man ; he could be taller by a foot or so , but then again , he ' s been on tv a lot of times and has probably got bigger legs and more than a few arms . i know that this series was going to be an exciting affair , but i don ' t think it really warranted any of the stories they had planned .|0
how any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me . i made an account on imdb just for fun , and the plot is a good one . i never had much interest in the story , so i never got to go to the cinema with it . however , once again i was disappointed with the premise : all i could see was my father getting murdered . i should have known better ; i should have seen his murder . there is no logic to what this character did with the camera . i should have been able to figure it out even before we went to the movie .|0
". . . now please move on because that ' s getting on my nerves . seriously , the man behind brilliant pieces like ` ` i think this movie is about to go down ' was not very convincing . how do you make a movie when you have no idea what kind of movie you will be making ? he is obviously in a snit , but he never says another word . i wonder why . . . * * * *

terribly disappointed with city of men after being swept away by city of god . lost is the exciting and terrible adventure of a young man trying to prove that he is no longer on the earth ! in fact , i would not be surprised if people did not realize that this is actually a movie written only for teens , not toddlers . but still , it is good to have you know that the characters are funny , interesting , and fun - filled . i hope that you like it as well because it is the least we can do .|0
O boy, was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV.|1
A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The sounds,courtesy of Japanese band 'Dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. It's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. All in all, they worked everything out perfectly....Well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted.|1
as cute and adorable as they are , the story of three singing chipmunks just does n ' t seem to have a single thing in it . this film is made in the 1920s with all of its own characters and plot and so on . i 'm not sure if it was based on this movie or simply because we were having a problem with the original script . i had never seen an original film at all , but i 've heard that the movies are very different from their original storyline . i saw some classic films where the main character would get excited about something , and then get annoyed at it .|0
awful in a whole new way , anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffs - - if only so the audience could get away with it . i do n't have time for this ; i have to get back to work , and that is my job . i am working on a book i was looking for . not a good story , one that looks more interesting than i thought there would be . i really wish i did n't have to edit it , it just does n't happen . well , we will see how it all comes out over the next few days .|0
another nice entry in the crime doctor series [ # 4 / 10 ] , with atmospheric almost noirish black and white film . i was not surprised to see this movie . as far as i 'm concerned , this movie can be used to provide a better quality for filming . it is much easier to figure out what is good and bad about life on the space station than on tv . the main thing that keeps me excited is how people are so willing to help others or at least assist one another . i had seen many movies like this before .|0
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film.|1
"Of course I am going to think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also. I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. The Director said ""It is taking to long, what would you do Gower."""|1
"This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of ""Do you need me/us now""? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie?"|1
dolemite is awesome . rudy ray moore ' s rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as far removed from a horror film as you will ever expect to find on a black screen . for the first three years of my professional life i was living a happy and contented life , and then i met someone who made me feel that i was no better than everyone else in their lives ( at least until i met her ) . she was good , intelligent , kind , and funny , but she had an aura of fragility .|0
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett (A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper... and it delivers just what I'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected it to deliver... and a bit more: Brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale.|1
this is one of the best episodes from the entire x - files series , creepy beyond words . the tension and angst in the movie makes you feel guilty for not having seen this movie before or since . i watched it three times to make sure i liked what i saw . i loved the title , and i really did hope that i would like it even more . as it was , i found myself thinking about the previous two months with my family , seeing them again , and wondering how life could have been different .|0
after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i wanted to be the one doing this . this was a big deal in hollywood , and there was not a single thing i did n't do . i even made my first movie in 2012 with a much bigger kick than the ones you get when you watch this one . this movie was really good . the plot was great , too bad the screenplay was short and the script was atrocious . i would love to have seen an actual film that was ' on the road ' instead of watching some old horror flick !|0
1st watched 8 / 7 / 2004 - 3 out of 10 ( dir - brett thompson ) : silly , juvenile - focused movie about three kids who are trying to make a great movie . the plot has a bad ending and it ends up in a scene where the twins get themselves into some kind of accident and end up being killed . i would never dream of watching this film if i was n't absolutely sure i was going to enjoy every minute of it . so for the record , this is exactly what my sister saw when she got back to the states .|0
Thats what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of getting away with it? In comes Richard Hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. A real BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement.|1
from the makers of underworld , we have , by far , the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen in my life . that film is a total mess ! it should have been made in a very good movie - at least i think it should be . i am not even positive how many characters are out there trying to do any good . what i am truly hoping for is a bit more action , some suspense , some action , and a bit of something else . anything that might provide me with the distraction of a movie can also make me feel a little nervous .|0
"When I first saw this show i thought to my self "" What is this!!!!!?"" Its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered ""huge"". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and well her family. Shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!)"|1
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but ""the"" icon for good-doers all over the world. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.Whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over Mr. Moore's treatment."|1
"in his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by Columbia pictures.It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.This monologue is not just about ""The Killing Fields"", or ""Swimming to Cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them."|1
i rented this film from blockbust because of the cover and title ! sounded intriguing ! ! this movie suffered a terrible curse that was worse than anything you can imagine . it was an all - about - to - die kind of film , which has made my life very boring . what happened ? i have just spent the last couple of days in jail for a total of 10 minutes . if i am reading this right , this movie sounds pretty much like this one . i am a fan of the movies , as well as being an avid reader .|0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles.|1
i ' m not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with , but how did this seem like a bad omen ? when i saw you at the bar in new orleans , i imagined it as a good idea . however , what i saw there is quite a different story . i was looking for a good story and came across one of them . it ' s a really old book that i never even thought of using as a character until just now . i remember reading a little while ago that some authors wrote about their experiences .|0
Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings.|1
i went into this movie with semi - high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood , and this nearly took its place as part of them . when a man gets married , he has to be prepared for what he finds in his bride - to - be 's bedroom . once he is married , it will all fall apart , if not before then . there is no guarantee that he will marry again . one thing is certain , though . you do not get married in hollywood , where you can always find another guy to entertain your wife while you enjoy her company .|0
Before you watch this movie - clean your ears, take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life-long enough. If you're Jew/Russian/Ukrainian/immigrant - yes, what popular-movie-minority so ever - laugh within your memories. If you're something else or whatever your are anyway - laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family. It this movie, nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem.|1
i do n ' t care what anyone says , this movie is hilarious ! it combines the bleak seriousness of threads and the dull , dead - eyes of an alien who has come here with a mission and hopes to rescue his friends from their evil prison camp . the horror flicks they have watched will be much better if they get to live in a world where they do not die at the hands of aliens . i like sci - fi that way . it seems to make people laugh less than normal when they watch them .|0
oh well . . . its funny . should have been a sadistic comedy , a lot of horror movies lack common sense and were not worth watching . it was an uninspiring piece of theatre . i liked it , so much so that i bought the movie . this film is one of the few that i actually liked . it had lots of characters , all sorts of names , but i did not like them . i was very happy when the director showed it to me two weeks ago . you could tell by the way his face turned bright red that he was going to turn around and leave .|0
"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called ""Big Fat Liar"". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie!"|1
As I write this in November 2005 I've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results Romantic comedies .|1
i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends . its reputation had preceded it , and most of the action on the film was made in the early 30s or early 40s , but none of the action was particularly good . i never watched the film because i did not really understand how to look for something good in a film . it was always very difficult to make anything worthwhile . some of the details were horribly uninteresting , even if they could be used as references to some of the character flaws .|0
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a film flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..This is a long film, but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love.|1
always enjoy the classic horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if you love crime novels just take a moment to check them out ! ! as i started my walk to the bathroom , i noticed a woman standing next to one of the men . he was still wearing his trench coat , she had her arms crossed and her face full of annoyance . she had long black hair that did little to disguise her appearance ; i would guess it was curly ( although i could n't be sure ) in the style of the 1920 's but it did not look too shabby or unkempt .|0
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.|1
"You know, this is one of those ""Emperor's New Clothes"" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts. Some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius."|1
i just saw this movie tonight . coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie ' s ideas , but after a few chapters it got out of hand and all the other characters were totally stupid . this was great , but we had to get ready for school . when the movie was over i walked out of the theater wondering what the hell i should do . i wanted to go to my parent ' s house to stay in bed with my mom but could n't leave my room at the time .|0
A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don't bring in an aura about them.What was so brilliant about Nagre(Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character?|1
mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood . no major stars show up - - the producers , directors , publishers , staff , and so many other actors are off the charts . that is not to say there is not a film going on in hollywood ; it just is not as popular as i initially thought . we are trying to do an excellent job at this because it will make it more interesting later in the movie . it also has some good leads , but you may have read the script already and it does not really look like much to me .|0
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.|1
"what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination , everything is so ridiculous . this is just too bad because this is one of my favourites about the movie . although , it was only 3 months ago and i would have bought it at some point in the future but since it had been released it was stuck . i am really not much into the genre , but as long as you are good at the movies , they will be very good . ok ? ! ! chapter 1 
 if you want to get to the part when you are eighteen , go ahead ."|0
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. For something made by an eighteen year old film student, I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti stick to the documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around Portland writing graffitti. He is joined by another and they skate around together creating art.|1
red skelton plays a radio detective known as ` ` the fox ' ' in ` ` whistling in the dark , ' ' the ghost ' and other awful things . they make this movie so horrible that it becomes an old - fashioned parody . the plot is pretty funny and there 's really nothing good about it . i mean , if you are a kid who lives in a suburb of san francisco ( where do you live when you have n't grown up into a rich man ? ) , you can probably get by with less .|0
"this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to convince my sister to watch it with me . she does n't want to see the film , but she loves having it on tv . "" "" do you have any idea how much trouble you are in at work ? people think you 're incompetent . "" "" no one seems to know anything about what happens here , "" jeremy said , as he walked into the room . "" why are they so busy ? "" he turned to his sister and raised an eyebrow . """|0
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and trite sports theme.|1
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move.|1
i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is good . if i ever do that again i will die from a heart attack ! as soon as the movie hits the ' go - to ' menu you can see that what you did last week was not very clever at all , and the film is nothing special or interesting . this was an awful scene and i feel really sorry for her . she seems to genuinely care about people and they seem to care about her .|0
although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure of watching it . after the movie i went into the dressing room to change and put on some clothes before heading to my apartment . i decided to come back to see what kind of movie he liked for the show , which was a real treat . when i stepped outside , it was dark and the sun still shone through the windows , as if nothing had happened . the sky was clear blue , but there were stars in the night sky .|0
After some quite OK Dutch action flicks, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He isn't a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. But even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told.|1
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated.|1
It may be, although there are still two or three I've missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not.|1
Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks?I mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. Med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. Bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies.|1
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short. ""The Grinch"" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. I used to like him very much in his ""Waynes World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and ""the Cat In The Hat"" has just finished me off."|1
"wow , this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends . if you have had a crap day , i would recommend getting out of the theater right now for some time . "" she laughed as she took another sip of her drink . i could tell just by looking that she was happy . we were going to get out of this , but there was so much that still needed to be said . the first thing that i saw when i opened the door to our home was the big picture window . it was on the left side ."|0
i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind . the trauma , the suspense is like nothing i have ever seen anywhere else . i am so tired of it ; i feel like i am going insane . after watching the same movie over and over , i ca n't take it any longer . what is wrong with me ? maybe it is from the way that i am looking at this film , or even because i really did miss this movie . but what is it about all of this ? i mean , you can see the plot in this movie , but this movie is so ridiculous .|0
"` ` hood rat ' ' is absolutely terrible . this is a urban version of ` ` willard ' ' . i just love to watch it , and there 's nothing worse than watching a car wreck on tv . "" the screen went blank for a couple of seconds before the image came back to life again in the middle of the screen . "" oh , come on , what an asshole . he was supposed to be the star of that movie ! but his performance has gone from bad to worse . by the time he got to the second film we were all sitting there looking at each other in silence ."|0
this is one great , sweeping , movie you will remember for a long time . it is about history , but there are two sides to it - the original and the original story . all we need to know is : which side is the best in ? i do not have an opinion of the original , i am simply interested in what it is like to be in the company of the other good people who make this movie . how bad could it be ! ? i can not believe anyone could give such a performance at any time . they must really enjoy this job .|0
this is the worst movie of all - time , no doubt , and schindler ' s list , did in fact have a little something like twenty or thirty lines on the screen . i was pretty sure i was going to be sick as well when i saw the first scene . it wasn ' t hard to see why they wanted to send me there . one of the many parts of the film that can be summed up at any point , are the basic themes . the first chapter is totally depressing , not to mention hilarious .|0
when king kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake , i was breathless . i do n ' t think this story is even close to what i enjoyed reading as a little child . however , at least i did n't have to read any other books . i am actually quite glad for that . but it is getting boring . let 's talk about something else while i watch tv with my family . i have just come home from work and had some time to myself . it is really rather boring . i have never had any trouble finding a place to stay before now .|0
This one's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words, but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen! I tell you I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of Physics and such (at which I've never been any good, in spite of my love of sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter anyway!|1
"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE."|1
i know it ' s hard for you americans to find european films on video / dvd , particularly from the 80 ' s . some of them are just so terrible . anyway , my point here is that every film in this movie is a piece of crap . as far as i was able to tell , no other person on earth knew what was going on when and where it was made . i had nothing more to do with it than anyone else but i could n't help notice that most of those movies looked pretty lame .|0
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. A film worse than the postman,sizzle Beach U.S.A, Batman and Robin, Kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. I do hope that Troma or someone in America would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the French stench at it's worth.|1
i went to see this because i ' d never seen tel - aviv , where the story is set . i was n't even interested in the story at the time , i was more interested in the action . i wanted to know who had done something so awful and so horrible as to send out a whole bunch of people to die in a park . the ending was pretty bad , but the premise was better than most of the stuff i have ever heard . the movie made it sound like they had been having fun , while actually they were trying to get them killed .|0
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...Actually, it is. It's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story.|1
This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make things worse, later Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood!!!??? And what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as alcoholic!?|1
I don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. I'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. Really, actually, I should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. Production is... well, okay. Barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clichés, and an abrupt ending.|1
i ' m sorry , but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock - off . totally implausible ( or at least somewhat so ) . for the last couple of months i have spent my spare time trying to understand the mystery of his life . all of the times he was acting like a normal kid , i would say it was only about seven in the morning and i would not have believed that something like this would actually be going on . i had never heard of any of these shows until today , nor did i realize how badly they needed to be played .|0
"A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple.Then there's Linda Blair. ""The Exorcist"". That's it.When you see ""Chained Heat"" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.Certainly not, ""Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come! ""Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize."|1
i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago . there are a good half a dozen books in this book , but very few movies that actually go by script . the most disturbing feature of them all is the first scene with an unknown female being led to a cabin by two other men . this is one of the first things i remember seeing on this show , especially when i was a kid . it looks like these two men are in their thirties and married . they seem to be happy and relaxed as they walk hand in hand across the property .|0
everything about this movie is awful . you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be horribly boring . there is even a part where the guy has to stand on his head while watching it , but i ca n't really tell if that was because he is having an out of body experience or if it was actually just for show at one point . anyway , the last scene is very painful . the director does n't seem to have much use for what is happening and as long as it is good , they do not care about how bad it is .|0
"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, ""Graduation Day""! All of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is, however, IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation."|1
Normally, I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like?|1
this is the last episode of the goldenboy ova series . kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio , where he is introduced into a plot that takes place in england and then moves from new zealand to france , where he meets some very strange people . this is the movie i first saw when i tried to sell my film at ebenezer scrooge ' s estate in the middle of september . while i have always enjoyed the films , i was disappointed when it turned out to be just one of dozens of old - school comedic movies based around medieval times .|0
it really is a great film ( after being able to ignore blake edwards pink panther references which he appears to enjoy ) and i thought it would be funny to have some of the best scenes ever . in the first part of the film i just did n't want to see this movie again , and as i walked along with my bag on my head and my arms behind my back i got so angry that i started to yell at everyone . the acting was horrible and all the acting was terrible . when the film is done i do n't want to see another movie like it .|0
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out.|1
"This is an interesting movie. I think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy ""self-portrait"" of an artist (""I make horror films. If I would make love films, no-one would buy tickets...""). And it's really SEXY movie also: Almost all the time there is some ""action"" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place..."|1
this movie took me by surprise . i first saw it more than 10 years ago , and it stays on my tv until i go to sleep at night , but now it 's the only show in the entire country i watched . i really thought there might be some way to make a movie as good as this . let 's see if they even know how to make a movie any more . the plot is much better than i am used to . i found this movie very entertaining , so i wanted to keep it up for as long as possible .|0
"I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher wasn't involved with this ""movie"". An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't make an appearance in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs."|1
having worked professionally with young girls on the run , i found this film surprisingly authentic . i would never have thought it was in a good way , but it sure seemed to have an upbeat beat to it . its dialogue and dialogue could be summed up like anything else that is going to go wrong . at least it was not what my parents expected when they bought this video . even if i did see a couple of comedians , i would still have seen one comedy , or two comedians ' . this movie looks like something you would expect in the 1950s .|0
"I found this an awfully disappointing experience! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.This ""Felicia's Journey"" is intriguing. It has drama. But it is full of stereo-types! So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of ""NEWS"" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! It is SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairytale of ""Little Red Ridinghood""!"|1

I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don't know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't.|1
"this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen . this is slow , plot less than nothing , and there are just no real scenes in it at all . after a couple of hours , the only thing i can say is "" so why do you have to be so good at everything ? ! "" the dialogue is bad - they make a bunch of jokes and the main character gets annoyed and goes on about how he has n't had enough time to go to the cinema or to try his hand at having some fun ."|0
It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally.|1
"this movie contains real animals been killed , like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been left on a lake . but what i was looking at was not the worst thing in the movie . the best parts are the ones that have no effect whatsoever on the story . it is so boring that you actually do n't want to watch it . anyway , i had just returned home from working at the local grocery store and was just about to sit down with my mother when she suddenly said , "" oh my god , look at this !

An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people.This beautifully crafted horror well, actually it's more fantasy/romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life. Problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button.|1
this was a pathetic movie . the alien was decent , but the movie itself gave a new meaning to the title . at least this is how it looks in the movies . i have never seen a tv show like this one before . it does seem pretty funny though , especially when you are faced with a zombie apocalypse of sorts . the only thing worse than being stuck in a basement is being stuck in a building that is not even made out of wood . there is no way i am going to get my homework done without watching this film .|0
i ' ll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it down . what are you thinking about now that you do not have your own show ? i would like to give you an example of this . in the mid - 1980s , a man came to new york city and asked the camera people to create a play for him to get a lead role with the movie company . the only way he could work was by selling tickets . there was no reason to buy a movie as cheap as this one .|0
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the ""thief"" was obvious. It was a poor man's (not to mention high school) ""Less than Zero"". I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. So many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. Avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst."|1
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. As previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. I felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones.|1
one would have expected hitchcock ' s return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution . there is nothing about this scene that makes it any less scary - but i can not help thinking that it is better than the movies , and the dialogue is very much as well done as any of the films i have seen in my life . this film has been created by a woman who loves her husband so much that she puts off her wedding vows for just a few days to spend time with their son .|0
"i kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way . i just did n't know what was going on . when i realized that it would be the last time , i decided not to give them a chance to play me again . this movie has got me so turned around that i felt like they were taking my life away from me . 
 "" if you are watching this movie , "" i yelled as loudly as i could , even though there was a small audience standing nearby , we were able to keep the sound down ."|0
it pays to watch reader ' s digest . or time , if it was the original source of the article . in this case , you might have been interested to see how the movie ended . after reading the first episode , i found that it was very difficult to focus on anything from the point of view of a young man with his mother having a baby who is struggling to cope with everything . and then i found myself thinking about my family again , and wondered why my mother seemed to have become so distant since coming back to the city .|0
well , this film came on on a workday at 230am . the cute little actress who played billy caught the attention of her ex - boyfriend as he was driving to a restaurant where his wife had been drinking . she said he was hot but that did n't stop him from hitting on her . unfortunately for billy , the movie was just about to be released and he decided to hang around with the couple for a short time until he could find something interesting to do . when he saw how nice the couple was , he decided to buy it .|0
A middle aged man, Robert Jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set. He has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with Mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.|1
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie begins. Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is Sarandon.|1
"I am sure I'm in the minority (I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character (the only other time I liked him at all was in ""A Bug's Life""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real."|1
this was a nice film . it had a interesting storyline , that was executed pretty well in the later scenes . if you like anything , you go for it at the beginning ; the best and worst movie you will ever know . the book was one of my most favorite to watch . i spent some time thinking about all the horrible people who lived in this country when i was young . as a kid i loved television movies . they were so easy and easy to see , but how are you supposed to get used to the way they act ?|0
"Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite ""up-to-par"" sex scenes. That's right another great softcore parody! I enjoyed this film greatly! Sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. But it's like the great god of softcore smut Russ Meyers said ""who really cares what goes down beneath the waist."""|1
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics, they released Irreversible and a range of Bergman's opus.The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's strangely titled film MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr Joe Average, replete with voices in the head, visions, and madness. It's set in rural redneck Australia, the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many Australian movies.|1
"""River's Edge"" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw ""Blue Velvet"", you know thats saying something. Viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated ""Kids"". The previews for ""Kids"" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. ""River's Edge"" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better."|1
this is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens . i unfortunately did not get to watch it earlier ; i was really looking forward to getting back home and seeing my mom and dad . on the way home i noticed a strange person standing next to another car with a woman in the driver 's seat . they were watching a movie at least 50 times , so i decided to come right out and say something about the film . i know what you are thinking . why am i such a wimp after watching all of this ?|0
I'm sorry but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked big-time. How in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews.|1
bad , bad , movie , so bad it is worth watching . as long as you watch this movie and act like you are happy with what you do , people will think you should have fun . if you watch this movie then you may not be aware of how much the character loves the movie but that is about as likely a good omen as any other . i hope you like this film . we can all agree it is not one of our better ones . i was hoping to save this one for after viewing it in the late ' 70s .|0
"Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Shall I go on? There is one, I repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing Amateur Hour Special of a film: Fares Fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking Swedish ""actors"" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning."|1
"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! ""The Beginning"" was not the greatest either but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. It's just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. I understand why this movie was redone as ""The Beginning""."|1
Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. I'd suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do. Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money.|1
So well done. The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. It's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. It's the best performance that I've seen from Ms. Capshaw--she's been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.|1
OhMyGAWD!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named Sherlock that lived in one of their trees. They also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: They don't MAKE shows like this anymore.|1
one of the best ' guy ' movies i ' ve ever seen has to be the wind and the lion . there is no other way to describe any of these characters . they are all so wonderful and intelligent that i think they ' re the reason why i like working here so much . not only am i an awesome writer but a really good screenwriter . i have worked with more talented people in the past , this movie was actually pretty great and it gave me an idea . i ' m going to need a little bit of feedback from you since i ' m not your typical author .|0
well , i have been to a british university , in fact i went to the one in this very building when i was young , but as a teenager it was only my parents who had kept me going - and they were never much good at staying in their job . then i came to england because i could not understand how anyone would choose to live in london on such a great day like this . now i see that perhaps you do not know this as the world has come full circle with some of the funniest films i have ever seen .|0
Let's get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards.|1
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an X-File. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up.|1
Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards.|1
love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love could be written . however , there are some good examples of this work . i will have to say that the overall idea was a rather poor one . many of the characters were not very original or realistic in all the places they were based in . if you 've ever seen someone write a story that is n't funny , then see how it is played . the script is actually pretty good , but it was so poorly worked that i do n't think you would really want to watch it .|0
it does not surprise me that this short ( 91 minutes ) b / w movie that was made 50 years ago , i am sure there is no way that it would be an easy fix . the premise of this movie should not have been interesting at all ; how can it be in any good way and yet still be believable ? well , you are wrong . this movie is so great that every time i come upon one of the characters - or actors - on earth , i always find myself wondering what type of person they were and what they were thinking about when they made this movie .|0
"Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said ""Don't be stupid, be a smartie. Come and join the nazi party"". It brought us delightful films, such as 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane! ', and even 'Naked Gun'. But the good die young. Luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. And then... the Wayan's Brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'Scary Movie'. Suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes."|1
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don't! This is no Disney film. This film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. The video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'.|1
"susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august , a single mother who ' s the working definition of "" bad luck "" . i spent most of the day watching that movie , but not much of it . i was actually enjoying myself , trying to keep my wits about me when i noticed a familiar face coming towards me from the left end of the stage . i thought i had seen her somewhere before , yet i could not be sure . i tried to tell myself that it was an amateur movie , or perhaps one of those hollywood horror flicks , but i would not be so sure ."|0
"What ever happened to shows with united parental figures? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they're ""cute."" This show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the ""divide and conquer"" technique is the best way to get their parents to ""cave."""|1
"As horror films go, ""Rest Stop"", could have been better in many levels. Director/writer John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. Several endings have been included in the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.The idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first."|1
underwoods goofy story about a young man ( arquette ) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra , but in truth he only has two things going for him in the way of an acting career : first and foremost , it is so unsexy . secondly , it takes too long to write a single novel and there really is nothing to look forward to . this would not have been an easy book for anyone like me if you could say i was on vacation with a couple of my girlfriends and decided to take a ride on a horse into the country .|0
"one of bolls better attempts . just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by thinking about it and not making the effort . "" he turned on a cd and started playing it , while i stared at his face . he had an old - school look to him now , with lots of high school jokes and sarcastic comments coming from his mouth . he kept going on like nothing happened , for almost an hour . finally , he asked , "" is there anything else you would like to discuss ?

"Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him. ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" is based on the concept of ""UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD""."|1
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name.|1
"a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie , but i feel this is really an attempt to play a game or show . it would n't surprise me one bit if there were some "" bad guys "" running around . you just do n't see them with their guns . they ' re not all that bad looking . i noticed a few movies on tv about the war in afghanistan which are supposed to have been fun and funny . well , most of them anyway . however , these are not what i expected from the american movies ."|0
as talk - shows go , larry king live is not bad , and since he occasionally gets good guests , it 's understandable . you get a great deal about the audience that does not really know what they are saying . the actors are a bit like this : ' i 'm gon na watch this stupid movie all over again and there 's so much of it i just do n't wanna watch it . i do n't want to see any of the other lame comedians . i don ' t care who writes the stupid script , but i don ' t want to see him .|0
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I've ever viewed. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it. Me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film. The plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding. The film ended quite abruptly, I'm guessing they ran out of film. Sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway. The guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder.|1
There's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time.|1
"There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. How ""Mostly Martha"" was remade is awful. The title of the movie is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of combining good cooking and USA is awful. If you have seen ""Bella Martha"", well that is the original title and it means ""Beautiful Martha"", this one is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms.Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better."|1
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine.|1
"**May Contain Spoilers**The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced ""dee-SAYd"") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant ""Nubian"" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME."|1
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see . it started of as a boy meets girl and they get to have a movie , then they get to spend the rest of the night with each other . i was not even interested in that part of the film and i never wanted to watch another episode of that stupid film again . i felt bad afterwards for taking my camera with me . there are some people who like an action flick and it is pretty good . however , at the same time i do n't think that i really care for either of these films .|0
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. This one though, is missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.Im in agreement with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. In this one, he is heading the emergency office. Being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. Clever thinking.|1
This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school, this was required reading in both languages.I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story.|1
"this movie is really bad . the hero ca n ' t play . you see too much that he learned his lesson and went away to school . it does n't make a lot of sense as well . what 's your point about the characters ? "" "" oh i do n't know ; i like them more than anything . i also liked the story when they played the character , which seems pretty good , but now i think there is more to the story . if we can figure out some sort of plot for the plot , then this movie should be a hit ."|0
"Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of ""Delusion"" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. When Jennifer Rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between Secor and Metzler is beyond ridiculous."|1
admittedly , the only reason i watched this film - - since it ' s been about a decade since it was released - was that i wanted to be with someone . but there was one person that made me lose interest . even then , i always hoped he would get his act together and start making some kind of decent living in this town again . after all , how many years ago was that ? i thought they were getting ready to release their film . the script was so perfect and the graphics so well done . it didn ' t look like anything out of the movies .|0
my mom and i , rented this movie . i mean , we love those type of sci - fi flicks , but this one was n't so bad . after a few minutes or so , i began to worry that maybe the movie might have been a little overdone . the only way i can say that i could have been more shocked would have been to hear that it did not pan out as good as the other films . i 'm not much for horror movies , which makes me wish i had never watched this movie at all .|0
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off.|1
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see.As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics.|1
the key scene in rodrigo garcia ' s ` ` nine lives ' ' comes when sissy spacek , hidden away in a cave at the base of a cliff , shows up on the island . her name is not even familiar and does not even have a clue as to her origin . but there is something strange about this film , particularly since the story seems to come from the same person who was responsible for making it . the premise is fairly predictable : an unknown woman falls off a cliff and runs into a waterfall . this makes it sound like the most romantic movie in all time history .|0
i had expected a fairly straightforward r - rated graphic , sexual , crude teen - comedy when i sat down to see this script . i really thought it would be interesting if we were n't going to find out anything other than the parts that were not what they appeared . but no such luck . as you can see there have been quite a few actors and directors . so i decided to check them out myself . it was kind of late afternoon when i finally came up with one that caught my interest . he was an early riser , tall , brown - haired , and very nice looking .|0
this brass eye special paedo - geddon was swamped by complaints ( more on that later ) when it was broadcast in the new york times . some of them are so ridiculous that they are almost too funny . one of them is even made out with a young lady and her son ! not to mention , we can all see what she does in bed . she has a nice butt ! i swear , if i did not hate my job so much , i would be glad to work here for $ 300 an hour . unfortunately , i am not very good at following the rules .|0
I saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. I just recently found an original VHS version, and purchased it for $125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the Broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.Why, it's just a little over paying for a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release this in DVD form soon. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!|1
this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . definitely not a well made movie . the script seemed so fast i could only watch it two times . that one , which is the main character , did not even seem like it was done in 1936 . there is no way i will ever get over what happens next . i want to show you a picture of the movie where the plot thickens and all of the story starts as if the movie itself were still in existence . then there is the first episode , but it seems to go along with the rest .|0
"` ` the bone snatcher ' ' starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of movie as a result . i think this is pretty much what they wanted to try . the story goes : "" at the age of 1 / 4 the kid becomes a great film - maker . he is a really good actor ; it is just hard for him to write a script like this one . his performance is very good because he is able to go off stage when he has to be in front of a group of people ."|0
"The first thing you should know about ""Zipperface"" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar ""home-video-ish"" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a ""real"" film. And ""Zipperface"" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a ""real"" serial-killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre."|1
a few yrs ago , i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell . that was it . and if you do not want more of me , maybe you can take it up with her . this book would seem to me like much better than this one did . although i could be honest about it , most of the plot has already been thrown into motion , so i just wish there had been a little more fun involved . but unfortunately for those who have read the novel , it seemed to be lost on them at the beginning .|0
yeah , i know my title sucks . i could n ' t think of any other title . x ] ice cream & ice cream . i love ice cream and it is very satisfying to see the ice cream melting in front of someone else , especially an old couple . if you really want to know what your favorite flavor is , then you have to get through some of the horror movies . i m not particularly into horror movies either , but i had a lot of friends in high school who wanted to watch them at least one or two times a week .|0
The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this! In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the populace that whoever messes with Chuck or his people have to pay the piper. This one is no fun.|1
yes , why ? among the filmmakers that came out in the 80 ' s and 90 ' s gus van sant would have been an outstanding producer . this character is a bit on the scrappy side . she is short and stocky and looks to be around 50 years old . the only resemblance i see to this character is in the fact that gus van sant was quite a good - looking young movie buff . he had all of the elements and none of them were great . there was no one in the theatre who could really compete with him .|0
"ok , so this is horror ? i get horror - but i do n ' t get horrific . black & white stuff ? yeah , maybe that was a bad movie , but there is no way i could ever want to see this kind of stuff . the characters are so creepy . the dialogue is so lame , it should have been on television . the lighting is so bad , you ca n't even read the script or even know where it 's coming from . for example , they all seem to think that someone has made some sort of stupid mistake when they start singing "" in the dark "" ."|0
this was absolutely one of the best movies i ' ve seen . excellent performances from a marvelous a - list cast that could have been made by a better actress , but still failed to bring any results . it certainly does look good if you are into the classics as well . this movie shows a lot of character , and it has lots of character . the overall effect on me is what i initially expected . the only way to describe it is rather simple : there is nothing funny in this movie at all , except the fact that it sounds very lame .|0
"You can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this ""freedom fighter"" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murdering scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men, Women, AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar."|1
I have seen this movie three times. Going back to VCR's, in the 1980's, and again on The Encor channel last night (Feb.11, 2010). Based on a true story which I remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, I've decided that I find it too disturbing to watch ever again. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. The creepiest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves little brother. (The story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the Internet -- just Google it.|1
some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote . i ' ve seen this , and not once has any of it really appealed to me in the least . the scene was pretty much the same as the rest of them . you could ' t believe that even if you looked carefully , you wouldn ' t find anything out of place . there are few scenes that show up as well as this . what we see here is an empty auditorium where people were hanging out , laughing , chatting , acting , playing pool , eating their snacks and drinking soda .|0
having been raised in canada , i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc . i have seen lots of horror movies , but there has to be an easy enough solution for a film like this . it is only one of the most terrible movies anyone has ever seen . every movie in the book comes down to this one . it is very hard to imagine a world so awful when you have seen some horrible things . what really sets this movie apart from the others are the fact that it just ca n't be expected to make any sense after seeing it .|0
i have read and enjoyed many of james lee burke ' s robicheaux mysteries . when i read ' in the electric chair ' , which is what i thought it would be like to read , i took note of all the other material in there . i know this is a terrible cliché but how can i tell you otherwise ? after reading one of the first three horror books in the series i was horrified to see that each book had been made on a different date . the main attraction of the story is that they are completely identical .|0
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. And of course us Americans just have to remake everything successful into English, because man reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard isn't it! From what I've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant Jessica Alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) It looks EXACTLY the same but probably w/double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks I have seen in any language in quite a long while.|1
i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth . she played well in this movie , but the plot is a lot worse than that . there was a great deal of drama and intrigue between the three characters ; the whole thing started at the beginning of the movie . it had nothing to do with me , nor did it have much to do with the film itself . when the two characters are separated , the only thing we can talk about is getting off the stage before they both disappear into one of their own . the story of shannon elizabeth makes me so nervous that i ca n't sit still .|0
this move is absolutely , most certainly one of the greatest films of its , or any other , genre . but if you have ever seen this movie , then know it is about a man who has a wife and two kids . i can not believe this movie would be allowed to play in a modern film with such a low rating . the only reason it was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to happen is because it lacked the proper amount of work . there are just so many actors that need a break , and they were not very good actors .|0
When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent.|1
I've never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid WWII historian, I don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean War bayonet lugs, K98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, German uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater.|1
sure , most of the slasher films of the 1980 ' s were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on , although there have been those occasions where you see something that was a bit scary - like being in a movie with somebody who had a gun hidden away in his crotch . i remember once reading about this movie and saying that maybe it was made by someone who wanted to kill himself because he could n't get rid of it . the reason why i think we would have seen this movie was because there was some kind of crazy cult out there trying to kill everyone .|0
I seen this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and great soundtrack. I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap (which I did not like)> This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but. This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *ROCK STAR* Yeah I said it.|1
When the movie first started I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics, I started liking it. The plot was different than anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was, the creatures where only there for a short time. I can only assume this was for money reason.The good side was that the movie was very entertaining.|1
"Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. ""Mostly Martha"" or ""Bella Martha"" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, to the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original."|1
yet again , director j . lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick . i was in a daze as i watched the movie , not knowing if it had to be reality or fantasy . i have never been a good friend to hollywood , nor am i very interested in what they think about me . this film is nothing more than a farce that has made me doubt myself over and over again throughout my adult life . i still feel a slight twinge of regret whenever i listen to its music .|0
I have only seen this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may sound a little bias but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th.|1
"visconti ' s death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made . while watching , we all get a sense of what a film is about . the author says that this movie is "" nothing special "" but there is no doubt about that . there is an air of unconcern about it , like they do not want to miss anything . if they are reading this , they must have liked it . how can a film be based on a piece of fluff when it was made so well known in new york city , philadelphia and around the globe ?"|0
This movie baffled me. I could not get a grip on it. Thought I might be missing something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This isn't always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so I will...They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I don't get it??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL!|1
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap.|1
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window.|1
It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion.|1
If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me!|1
you belong to me was the final teaming of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it is a good movie . i am not an actress , but i can be creative when i want . this movie was about a man in his sixties who was on the verge of bankruptcy and was struggling to raise his two children in a foreign country ( he would have preferred they remain in their home in europe ) , but he somehow managed to find enough funds to pay the rent and pay for a couple of meals from the food stores in the south .|0
"I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.The dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?It felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. The stereotypes and jokes about ""men's groups"" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.Apart from the attractive Irish man - this film was a dud."|1
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. It is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.Connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot. Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). A marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.|1
"The original ""Psycho"" (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates."|1
"this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old ` ` cons turn good ' ' yarn , which we have to assume is a joke of some sort . these people had nothing to gain from the stories they were writing and i am sure they wanted to sell the whole thing . "" "" yeah , you said that , it just seemed so ridiculous . there is no sense of humor in this movie unless you get your idea out of the box or something . i think it is just plain dumb . "" "" do n't be fooled by the movie quality , "" said steve . """|0
finally ! third time lucky . this film has been always been on my mind , but my first viewing of the sequel ( which was a comedy ) was more of a romance / horror thriller , and i just could not get it down . the only problem with this is that we had all these episodes before , but after about a half an hour , the producer gave up on trying to convince me to see any movie he thought would be better . i mean , i can see that this is hard , but i do n't care at this point .|0
I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it.|1
ca n ' t liberals like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004 ? if i were going to be an old lady in a big , ugly house in a nice suburb of new york , i would have bought a tv . i know i was a little bitter at this time , but i remember being so scared by the whole thing . i had no idea how much trouble that was going to be . when you are trying to get someone to do what you want , people tend to stay away from it .|0
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the ""war on terror"" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface."|1
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. We all agree it shouldn't have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. If you do end up going, don't take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family!|1
"""Witchery"" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.The gore in ""Witchery"" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets ""sucked"" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast!"|1
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who' history as its most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-rate new Doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant.|1
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy.This movie is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. It's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success.|1
maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv - movie will be pleased with it , but if any parents are excited by its content , then that should be good enough to get them to buy it . i 'm hoping the producers would agree with my plan since they have absolutely no reason to want to make a movie like this . all i can say for sure is it is too bad it did not come out in print . the story seems to have just been turned off and as far as i can tell there was no sign whatsoever of a plot other than what we saw at the movie trailer .|0
"imagine what it must have been like for john agar . one of hollywood ' s handsome leading men . married twice before and divorced twice after . he was a good salesman at the time , but never made enough money . in the early nineties he went out to buy a new boat and got himself stuck in an indian fishing channel . after a few more hours of struggling to get back to shore , he ran aground in the deep end and ended up stranded with his boat and his life jacket .

do n ' t get me wrong , i assumed this movie would be stupid , i honestly did , i gave it a much better ending than the other three . but still i was n't sure what to believe . how could he have written this crap ? the plot and characters seemed different to me , but then again when you look back on the few years that went by i ca n't help but wonder if this movie was originally based on this movie at all . i suppose it does n't surprise me in the extreme .|0
I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. There's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this.|1
"""Carlito's Angels"" is a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (I think ""fast-motion"" stopped being funny around 1914). The assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! The girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination."|1
i ' m sorry , perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 , perhaps it was a joke to start with and now it must go on forever . in fact , it ' s the worst movie i have ever watched . when i get to see it you can only imagine how awful it would be to watch it . the actors are terrible . at least from my point of view they really should have come up with better movies . if that was the case then i would have never left the house in the first place !|0
if u have n ' t seen vijay in ` ` ghillli ' ' , ` ` gilly ' ' or ` ` ghillie ' ' . go on ! what 's the big deal ? she 's a good friend of our mother . i think this is the only way that she could ever tell us that we would n't understand what was going on in this country when we saw her in the first place . it seems to me that they were so busy with their lives , that they never had time to talk to each other about anything . they were always busy trying to make ends meet .|0
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM. I'll explain why.1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film'.|1
For several reasons, this movie is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant. I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. And shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. But this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.There's worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing.|1
"People call a 976 ""party line"" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).Meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims."|1
` ` catchfire ' ' or ` ` backtrack ' ' as it is sometimes called , is not very good . that is where we are in the game . if i can tell you what happened , all i can say is that this was the best game ever made , and it will be even better from this point of view . some players were really good at the game , and others were really good at catching the ball . one bad player could get caught with an easy start . so much of this game had been written up in movies and documentaries to justify its use .|0
i viewed my videotape last night , for the first time in at least ten years . i found the film to be quite funny , but that was not what really happened . there was this girl who did it with her friend while they watched a tv show . it was just like one of those bad horror movies about kids being killed in cars . the kid looked awful , she was so cute ; she even had a great accent . the movie showed a very happy family , and you can picture them eating ice cream with their friends .|0
i did n ' t even watch this whole movie . now , i like 50 ' s sci - fi movies even when they ' re about a teenage girl getting pregnant by a psycho . you ' re supposed to have some kind of power over them and there ' s something funny about the show , but it ' s really bad . it was just a comedy on a tv set for a short time , then suddenly turned into a horror film / comedy series . i don ' t quite know how i could do that .|0
as much as i love the story of david copperfield , i can not claim to have enjoyed this movie quite as much as you and i . i just ca n't wait to take it down . thank you for reading this novel ! i was very glad to get a free sample from the indie series , so i hope you enjoy this one . i hope you will feel at ease sitting in the same room with your parents . they are very nice but i find that i would rather go home to see them again .|0
"hearkening back to those ` ` good old days ' ' of 1971 , we can vividly recall when we were treated like kids in a cartoon . "" "" what happened ? "" david asked . "" this is a great story . how did you two get here anyway ? "" "" we decided to see how it would go , "" the editor - in - chief said . "" i mean , for one thing , we do n't want to make it look like a crime scene . and secondly , that is a bit of a shame ."|0
"I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. But when I saw the beginning credits, I said ""oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan who used to star on my favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put on a few pounds but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. too bad I didn't sick around to see her in the film. I bailed out 20 minutes into he film."|1
i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes . i feel comfortable writing it now , but i feel like a failure in some ways . it does n't matter at all . i will have to look into it more carefully after the story is finished ( if possible ) and i will find it extremely hard to get something done . i think you will love this one . the first character is an ordinary human - looking young girl . her name is angela . she is about ten years older than me . she is on the same school as me .|0
a must see documentary . - - - - - this movie had so many things to consider while watching it . it was n't like you could put a dvd in and change it , because it would take ages to process the entire series . the movie itself was such a complete waste of time and energy that i hated it . i hated every word that came out of this movie . why did it have to be this horrible ? all the characters seemed to have the same theme : they were all completely clueless and stupid .|0
i watched this movie last night , i ' m a huge fan of the book , and i was pretty damn surprised that it was on the tv in my apartment , but it really did catch my interest . not just because the film was funny and entertaining , but mostly because it made my head spin . when you ' ve lived with a girl your whole life , you will never quite get used to watching her make jokes about herself . for example , she says something funny , and the more she talks , the weirder it gets . she is such a dork .|0
this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and culture . i had no idea , until now , how much it was going to affect my art . not only that , but i am quite aware that there are certain aspects of the film that have been written down in the last five minutes because of the sheer volume of commentary . i felt sorry for her and decided to watch the movie for a second time . when i finally managed to get out from under the covers , i thought i would die of fear if i stayed in bed .|0
it ' s the sooooouullltakaaaa ! wow . what a skin peeling bad movie . honestly , this is one of the more depressing movies that i have ever seen . i do not know how anyone can watch something like this on television without laughing and crying . i want to run out the front door into the parking lot and beat some heads off with my fists . this is one of the most depressing shows i have ever watched . why did we put this on tv ? i just ca ' t figure it out yet . i was hoping that this might help in some way , but nothing seemed to work .|0
ham - handed homage to honest hacking . felt good in a soft - core way about equivalent to its mild pornography , until you got too used to it . after all , it was not as though i could be bothered to even consider buying a proper set of clothes . one day , on a rainy afternoon , the sun went back up . i was wearing this shirt and some jeans when i saw a guy in a long dark overcoat come out of the bookstore . he walked slowly , casually , like he did n't have a care in the world if he was late .|0
there ' s hell to pay when you cross nami matsushima ( meiko kaji ) , female scorpion , and a very few other members of the government ' s inner circle . i don ' t think they give a damn about what ' s going on in our world or who we are , or whether we are a threat . at least , not yet . for now , this is just a harmless little thing that will pass by and get forgotten soon enough . i feel sorry for the poor person that had to learn about it all before he could be a part of it .|0
Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie It's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful.|1
"this is one of the most unoriginal , cliche - ridden movies i have ever seen . even if you did n ' t know it was based on some of the worst movie lines i ve ever seen in my life , this film is pretty bad . seriously . how did anyone live through this shit ? i ' ll be damned if i ' m going to watch this one again . i think we should take a break . * * * 
 when i first heard that he had just been arrested for murder , i was so worried about him that i really did not care what his name was ."|0
"Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. The only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). The dialogue...the plot...if this ""movie""(and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this."|1
i was very disappointed in this film . the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors , but that 's about it . the director is not as good at this as the rest of us and he has no flair for these films . it is quite sad really . i think there is something to see on the back of these movie posters . the first part of this film is based on a story written in 1937 by one of the greatest minds in america . the story seems to be going along like a dream . if only you had gone to my school with me .|0
*****I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean.|1
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr. ).|1
this is a well - crafted piece from everyone ' s favorite master of suspense . as usual , the technical elements such as the dialogue are just not very useful in this case , but that does not mean that we will get much of it . if you would be so kind as to make this movie based on an earlier one i would love to hear what you have to say . let 's start with something else and leave it there . ok . i do n't suppose you can write this film unless you are at least 20 years old and live in the middle class .|0
"I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge."" I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see ""small"" movies about ""small"" people in ""small"" bars that are in ""small"" towns."|1
Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? Did you not see that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The acting was fine, sure. But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. Things happen, but that's it.|1
"it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing . the acting is lousy and some films are so awful that i would like to have spent more time in the theatre than watching them . "" "" i am sure there were other things you could have done , but why did you leave your family to live in an apartment with people who made fun of your choice ? "" asked zachary , trying to be understanding . 
 "" ah well , this is just the beginning ."|0
"i was a fan of buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when angel got only one . as if the story could ever have ended on its own . "" well , you 'll probably get to see more of them in the movie . i always wanted to be an artist . there were lots of great artists in america but some were too stupid to know that they had to write about themselves . then there were the critics who called themselves geniuses , which is exactly why none of them were talented enough to create a decent show ."|0
"Down Periscope is not a ""Great Movie"". But then again very few flicks are. So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a ""great movie"", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must take on the entire US-navy with it's nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome."|1
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film.|1
i found the movie very interesting . i really enjoyed the film the actors were great . it was entertainment , but it did not come close to getting me on the list of people in this film who deserve to die like this . i got a good view of the whole film , and i watched it as much for the first time . there are times when i would like to see the movie again , but i could not afford to . after seeing it once more , i had no desire to see it again . what if i get to watch this one again ?|0
"The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and Bernstein's rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts ""II"" and ""III"" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces."|1
i started off being interested somewhat in the movie . it appeared it might be serious drama , dealing with an ex - girlfriend who used to play tennis with the local high school and has been trying to get his head out of his ass for a while now . there were lots of good comedies that made this movie more interesting , as did many of the really good ones . i had seen quite a few reviews of this one . some of these ' comedies ' were not what i wanted to watch but some of them actually helped me learn the film .|0
"to date this is still the worst piece of rubbish i ' ve ever viewed . so annoyed i even complained to your brother that he should put it in an open box and watch it burn . i don ' t have the heart to turn it over to the media - it ' s bad enough being on tv , now i ' ll have to see it in person . "" "" really ? "" asked mr . king . "" i never had any idea you liked films . "" "" well if i didn ' t know better i would have thought you ' re trying to make me dislike them ."|0
it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film . initially , i was struck by the fact there are six characters involved , one of which is the actor from my last movie . the rest of the movie is a complete and utter failure . the acting is so awful , i had to sit in the front row while the director used the remote to shut it up . after that , i wanted to jump in the shower as soon as possible . i even tried to see if i could turn on the soap or at least put on a shirt , but the water was already freezing .|0
I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost nonstop until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I was left speechless.Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside.|1
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry in Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly weird Bubba Ho-Tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this TV episode. The plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. This time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac.|1
this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world . the social criticism of our shallow , low - budget society is just too much fun for the average person . as a child i was so angry with my mother and dad that i used to spend hours talking about them in graphic detail . they would never let me play video games . they would make it seem like i could do what i liked , and that ' s exactly what i did . now i feel very bored by all the action .|0
i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one . paul giamatti lets it all go - he gets angry when he sees what a complete moron i 've become in my efforts to create a good example of him ! i have never been much for portraying his work , but that 's exactly what was written there . as a kid i was so focused on being a decent writer that i did n't really even bother with anything other than creating stories . after watching how awful they were , i thought maybe someone was paying me a little visit or something and wanted to get their hands on one .|0
I'm not really sure where to begin. From start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob.|1
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14 . i was really annoyed with my little cousin at the end of the movie . you see , it was on the news before i moved in so i got up early to watch it . oh well , after that i could n't wait to get away from everything that was happening in my life , so i spent most of my days trying to catch up with people who were having a good time . this film has been popular since its inception , and i love every minute of it .|0
What can I say?? This movie has it all...Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my all time favorite movie that I can recite line for line....I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl.. (Hey, I even remember the song by Moon Zappa, do you?) Tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....|1
there was nothing remotely funny about this movie . it makes fun of various sports movies and cliches but nothing like this . the story is so depressing . i just want to watch a bad sitcom and be done with it by the end of the film . here goes nothing . the script takes a right turn , and suddenly i find myself in an alleyway . it 's dark , but there are lights up ahead . i get out and try to take a look at the source of the headlights . they are bright and shining .|0
"This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that it has the cliché ""You really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story"" routine dragged out for a while."|1
"This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, ""well, it's a comedy show,"" so I'll laugh, I guess.I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.Why can't America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.She is not funny."|1
"I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show ""The Big Valley"". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.And so it was for ""Christmas in Connecticut"" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas."|1
"camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film . we ' re mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project , and i would hate to see what happens if people start seeing this movie . "" "" please do not give me anything special on this film ; there are just too many scenes . the plot has nothing to do with the story or genre of this film . you can ' t even imagine the characters in this film ( it ' s a total dump ) . it was basically a waste of money . who gives a crap about this movie ? !"|0
"at first i did n ' t think that the performance by lauren ambrose was anything but flaky , but as her acting took a turn , she had some amazing voice and she was beautiful . she went through with all of her parts and played well . when she came over to us , i could tell she felt really bad for having to perform so poorly , and i told her i just wished she would go back home and let us do this . she looked at me sideways , shrugged her shoulders , gave me a quick peck on the cheek and said , "" i know , i know ."|0
most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate . it is an hour and half waste of time , but then there are a few instances where i feel more like a character out of the movie than a regular person on the shelf . that night was not particularly good , but you get used to it after a while . one thing that i had never experienced was being forced to work in a house full of spoiled brats . it took some time to find a place to park , because my parents would n't allow me to park with someone who does not have a car .|0
"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see""."|1
and obviously i did n ' t see it ! but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back there , he ' s not just a movie . he don ' t look like he can do anything to save his life . when i heard this film , i got so excited i had to be on my way to the restroom . i know i should have been more worried about how well the script is going , but i was so busy wondering how i would get out of this one , i barely saw what i really needed to know .|0
"As an ex (nuclear) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the ""inside jokes"" from the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the ""Orlando"" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely ""DBF"" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the Admiral in charge here?"|1
"Follow-up to 1965's ""My Name Is Barbra"", and shot in brilliant color, ""Color Me Barbra"" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (""One Kiss"", ""Yesterdays"")."|1
"Yes, why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's ""Psycho"" however, gives me pause. Why? I wonder."|1
It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull off Shakespeare's Othello, by bringing it to modern day context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. There were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending in Dessie's death.|1
Although this movie (and I use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway, certain that if Jones was in the movie, it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses, I was additionally reassured by seeing another well-known face.|1
Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable.It left me yearning for a real film. :)The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes, which dissipates any discernible tension.And the character relationship 'twists'? Yeah, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline.|1
"it ' s been a long time since i have been in the art - house theater and i went to see douches , "" he explained . "" it was pretty good , though . i didn ' t expect anything different . i watched a few more scenes , and then when i thought i had finally seen every action flick i could ever remember seeing , i felt really bad for watching them so i did some of the other movies on the shelf . i am glad that my mother chose to buy such a nice one . i thought that this film was much more exciting ."|0
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure, the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort.|1
"i think i can safely say ( without really giving anything away ) , that this movie had no robots . when you see someone else with a robot it tends to make a good story . as the credits begin rolling i look over at ryan . "" what the hell was that about ? "" i ask . he looks like he has never seen a sci - fi movie before so his expression is one of pure bewilderment . "" who knows ? "" i say in exasperation . "" it could have been funny , it just seems so stupid . "" i said ."|0
the evil below starts on ' the straits of san sebastian 1683 ' as the 17th century treasure ship the el greco - roman war machine . at the moment , though , he does have something interesting to say . after a while , i can not stand his voice and i think maybe it has something to do with the lack of a proper naval command system . he is one of those guys who thinks they need to make everything look like a military action movie . there was one time that i saw him sitting in front of his computer , but he just watched tv .|0
dear reader , watch out ! this movie is not really a movie , though its creators have the impertinence to mention it was written in 1936 , and has yet to be produced . when i was an adult i loved that movie , but i never would have considered myself a big fan of it if i had known there would be a sequel to it . my mother used to tell me one day how she could always count on her grandchildren to come back and watch the movie . i must say that it was somewhat disappointing , because i was expecting to see more of the same characters all over the place .|0
First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong.|1
jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men , which he perfected in the second book . i mean , if anyone knows how to fix the movie , it would be him . with a film like that , you have to really believe it is one of the most successful movies on the planet and you get a special rating from the characters . also , these movies are very good and the plot is incredibly entertaining . they even make this movie interesting , though i think it is not quite as bad as you might think .|0
* * possible spoilers ahead * * whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes , they always go back and tell us what the worst movie has ever seen in their lives . here , i want to say that this was not the worst movie ever made . it actually was quite cool . all the actors were cute as sin and all the acting was easy . but the plot was very boring , and we were all disappointed in the end . when i said that i thought the whole thing was pretty good , i was told it was just an attempt to show off some talent .|0
this show is made for persons with iq lower than 80 . the jokes in the show are so lame they sound as if they were made by a teenager . there was no humor in the movie . that is just not what i expected at all . it is certainly not what i expected to see when i first walked on stage . i thought maybe the producers and crew would take the opening act as one of the main characters from the movie , but they have not . i am surprised that the cast and crew actually voted for this . they should be proud of their ratings .|0
i love cheesy horror movies , i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think slumber party is my least favorite thing to watch on tv . i 've seen this movie plenty of times in my life so it never occurred to me to check the cable or radio channel before i went to sleep . now , if you 'd rather watch something else than watch zombie movies , i could really use some popcorn . i 'll admit there are a few parts where the plot stinks , but nothing like this . this was not a film that i liked much as a child though .|0
"solomon and sheba has come down in hollywood lore not for the quality of the film , but for the entertainment value of the story . "" "" i think a lot of these things are being written about me so that i will never be quoted here again . i do not like this script at all . it is very bad . you should know better than to put a name on any scenes that have been done by someone who does not have a clue about their own character . the only good thing about it is that it sounds like an awful way to spend my day ."|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. This is an oblivious labour of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full truly artistic elements. The movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by Mishima to him. All without being confusing in the least bit. The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won.|1
i love these awful 80 ' s summer camp movies . the best part about ` ` party camp ' ' is the way the kids get up from bed in the morning without any effort on their part , and act as though they just walked out of a shower . no one cares what anyone else thinks because if you go to college you do not have to waste your spare time watching old movies or trying to decide which side you want to take to win a scholarship to harvard . it was almost like having a tv that turned itself off during the night .|0
You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey.|1
this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema . by seeing this film , we know that it is from a movie of great horror , not real life at all . i can assure you this film is based on much more realistic reality . and it really is good - but do n't judge me for the fact that i have to try and convince you otherwise . here is a brief overview of the role of this film . it is very well written and has a beautiful quality . the plot is interesting and the characters are interesting .|0
` ` strangers on a train ' ' was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never witnessed . not that there was much to see and i was just as surprised by what i saw . the actors in this film did have great talent , but at least they did not need to do something completely unmemorable to make it exciting . the movie was not bad . i really liked the premise , although i knew very little about the character and its characters . there are some points where i could describe the plot perfectly , but so many of them are pretty vague .|0
"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece."|1
Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious.|1
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film.|1
i have watched the root of all evil with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . that is , before we knew there were any things to say . ' it ' s funny how many people believe in god . but not many believe in anything other than sex . at the end of every movie , one of these guys comes to know about what 's happening and he tries to warn everybody away . it seems that the two guys are friends , but after a few weeks , the two guys come back to the dorm room and start talking .|0
Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf, and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.This film has so many good things I can't even say them.|1
"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the ""earlies"" (often black and white and inventive), the ""naughties"" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the ""nudies"" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and ""the rest"".This is part of the ""rest"". It is not really a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly no gorefest. The few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all."|1
"This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.Hilarity ensues.Like the ""Police Academy"" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes."|1
as far as i am concerned , this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to what we were thinking of making in the movie . first off there were so many characters , that there were so many great scenes . the only thing i really liked was how a lot of the actresses acted and played their roles . they also had a bit of a sense of style and style which made it interesting to watch them . most of the actors did not know how to act or act , so you do not really understand what is going on until it is too late .|0
to even say that this film is sebastien ' s work at his best just tell you everything you have to know , because it 's not really a movie at all . i had been so happy and carefree back then , but i had become disillusioned by the whole thing . in fact , i am pretty sure i could never be happier . now my mind is thinking of something that i should have seen earlier , but i was too lazy to care . as soon as we finish filming , there are only about 45 more scenes to go and i am having a lot of trouble watching it .|0
dreadful , stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the louisiana purchase lumber company . everyone in the state of louisiana seems to have it on tape . is there anything you like better than a bad movie ? why do you watch it anyway ? who is it about ? i could tell this was a bad movie if you tried to talk to me ; however , you should have taken some time to go over this video . let me remind you that this film is supposed to be about a girl who has been kidnapped by a very dangerous man .|0
night hunter is a sold b style action movie . get a life and grow up people . don ` ` t be an idiot . you will know what it is even if you watch it for a couple hours . in fact , i ' ve only seen this movie once . it was filmed in the summer of 1951 on a country farm in california . there is a farmer who works as a doctor to save a family from the dangers of the wilderness . unfortunately , all he can do is drive off without ever knowing his wife , daughter , or children are gone .|0
At first sight, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.Really, what you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him, he needs the money.This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago.|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward...granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be, but i thought this was amazingly well-acted, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in exectution. i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play, it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick. i am also a great fan of alan rickman, so that might be my bias.|1
naach a more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web . this one is a good portrayal of the work of the actor , who used the role to make it sound as though he was having a better time than he actually is . you may also find this picture somewhat difficult to figure out ; the plot is too well crafted and there are so many bad lines that it is impossible to judge whether anyone really cares about the performance . the best way to read the story is to keep an eye on the cast .|0
we have a character named evie . evie just wants to be a good person . she ' s nice , but is too dumb to take the time to understand why people make movies with such a small plot and so little character structure . the main thing in this movie is the fact that it didn ' t include anything that would actually give you a sense of what the characters or character really were like . if you do not like the acting , you ca n't possibly understand who they are because it was never done .|0
"One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.As nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! The cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, the one of the ""Shining"" is funfair! NB: a lot of users think that it is located in the French Riviera! They are wrong!"|1
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. And that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. But this is beyond bad. This movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. First off, the CGI has to be one of the worst i've seen.|1
after the success of star wars , there was a boost in interest in sci - fi movies . this was one of those things i had never seen before . well , i saw some pretty good sci - fi movies so it was no surprise that my reaction to this one was not as unconvincing as it should have been . and then i heard something about aliens . i remember thinking how odd that would have been . they do n't talk much about their culture , nor do they tell you what they like or what they prefer . what is the point ?|0
Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times.|1
poor bela lugosi . just another day at work . a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war is trying to infiltrate russia , and we do n't want them anywhere near the u.s. it looks like the entire world is on the brink of war as this movie starts again in 2046 . i 'm very impressed with what happened on this film ( although i really do n't think there ever had to be any reason to ) . not only that , however , the characters all look so bad , you might as well ask if they were murdered .|0
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this story have done so . there is no other way that i can describe it as bad . if i was to write a good story i would probably be criticized by the audience and then they would want to re - read it . but because i did not work hard enough on this book to put together an original , my editor insisted i should make a better show out of this . i could only hope that this will be enough . what is the worst that could have happened ?|0
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron! ), the piano-playing dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back, funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc.|1
one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third coming . some people just want to get rid of the bad stuff they 've got on them . that sort of thing is hard to come by in any industry . i can see how you would suggest it . but there are lots of things that really annoy me about it , and no matter how much i tell you not to look for this film , this is just plain stupid . if you want to go to war , do it with your heart .|0
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate.|1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself.|1
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such,there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more.|1
i have just seen today you die . it is bad , almost very bad . 1 ) the direction and editing are great , but 2 ) you will never hear anything more interesting than this movie : the story of a child who takes his parents away to the country for a weekend to live with her father in a foreign country . this is something that i ca n't watch or even see anymore because i was taught to not watch television . so here i am watching an old movie that i do not want to watch at all .|0
"I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. However I saw it on Irish TV recently and there was an added narration by Roy Scheider (""we're going to need a bigger boat!""). This ruined the film for me. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. I wonder at the new DVD version that has no Roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it."|1
now for sure , this is one of the lightest - hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and will ever tell about his characters . i have to say i think it 's pretty good . at first , i was a fan of bruce willis , but then i read some of his books and i thought he might be a bit over the top . while i was n't disappointed , i did find the book quite interesting . there were a few moments on the movie screen when bruce willis goes down into hell .|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. She should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave.|1
Although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days.|1
"Having endured this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end. Throughout the film I felt that I was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and taut, camera work appalling, and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local High School ""Amateur Dramatic's Society"".The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in its credits, other than that it was pure dribble."|1
A antique shop-owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley(Valerie Alston)gets put on a US District Court jury, on a trial of a known Mafioso Armand Asante(Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of Pirone attempting to get Whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. Much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with Willam Hurt as the go-between. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable.|1
"I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as ""The Sound of Music,"" none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially amazing songs are ""Easy To Be Hard,"" ""Age of Aquarius,"" ""Hair,"" ""Flesh Failures/3-5-0-0,"" ""Walking In Space,"" and ""Hare Krishna."" Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to someday see it live!"|1
the outsiders is undoubtedly a classic australian tv series . well defined characters , tight scripts , varied and interesting plot - all very hollywood . no wonder they have such an impact on their lives : this has to be one of the worst sitcoms i 've ever watched . in fact , i would not have been surprised if it was written by someone with a better sense of humor . however , i am glad i was spared watching it . i really want to make this movie when it is filmed . it is too bad the acting is not good , because i could have made it a good one .|0
"secret service agent jay killion ( charles bronson ) has been assigned to protect the president - elect ' s wife , the woman who has become such a celebrity that no one can remember her name and probably never will . this is a very sad story and i think we should turn it into a movie . "" there were so many things i wanted to say . in the last few days i had seen some of the coolest movies i had ever seen . they were not only amazing , they were absolutely awesome . the characters were fantastic !"|0
Got to confess right up front that I didn't watch this entire movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers sum this one up nicely. It was badly conceived. Badly scripted. Badly acted.But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. And hang. And hang.|1
the final part of kieslowski ' s trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace , as if there was any other . but i must point out that the film is in a constant state of disrepair , and so it is hard to feel happy when you have no time for your own family . however , we are allowed to watch this movie , which is good , because it is entertaining . i am looking forward to seeing these scenes , because they can be very nice and amusing . the book is one of my best and the characters are really interesting .|0
I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. The film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. The acting was absolutely dreadful. The children were overly whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept from peace. The monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. The drama is laugh-worthy. I cannot remember when I saw a more dreadful film.|1
"mystery science theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ` ` movie ' at all . it is , however , a masterpiece that makes up for its injustices in the most amazing way possible . and if it was not so bad before , i would like to show you how well the rest of this movie actually compares to the movie . here are the good parts : 
 4 . the only thing that changes the characters is that they are no longer made out of ordinary human beings . this film will be different ."|0
I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast.|1
this film is one of my fondest childhood memories . seeing the muppets ( at the height of their popularity , i loved to watch them as a boy ) on television made it so much better . and that ' s the way i like it for movies . they are always full of characters and funny dialogue . but this is a very sad time in a movie . there are lots of dead people scattered across the theater . the actors were all murdered by animals . we have also seen more gruesome horror films in the past few hours than we have had since world war ii .|0
Like the previous two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film.|1
It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego.|1
i was 19 years old when i saw first saw this film , in the theater . i have a feeling that i can learn to enjoy films as long as i choose to . i know this because of how much time i spent with my parents , and about the way they talked to me throughout the movie . so , if you ever feel like it is an excuse to see one of your friends , do not hesitate to find me . i still miss them . i wish i could say that we are all great friends who really care about you , but we are completely opposite personalities .|0
"The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata""(1978) starring Ingrid Bergman,Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson.It did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.It is time Film journalists like Khalid Mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. It makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of Hollywood and European films.You've got to give the film-maker something though. The film he picked for copying is one of Bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in European cinema."|1
i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly disappointed . now i get to read about it through a cheap tv and not have to watch any more movies that would make you feel guilty about reading about it , although there is really no reason for anyone to be ashamed of what they are doing ! this is a horrible movie . i do n't know whether to be horrified or angry . the fact that it has a title makes me like this movie even more . i ca n't imagine how awful it looks to be in its former glory .|0
everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . this is simply a ` ` run of the mill ' movie with a few bad twists , some good scenes . i like the premise well , but the plot was so predictable . i think we should leave it up to the director to come up with something new . and if anyone wants to start acting they 'll get the job done ! i have a feeling that it will not be any kind of work for anyone who has never had a shot at a film .|0
"this is a film by oshima , the director of the notorious ` ` in the realm of the senses ' ' . it is not really any good , because it lacks anything resembling reality . 
 "" i saw it once during my life ; i was a little young when it had it . on the back was a picture of an old man , dressed in a shabby dress , who was trying to convince his wife that he was one of the original people who took the movie out of the storage tank . he was so convincing that she actually said no ."|0
first of all , the nature in the movie is beautiful , and there is a bit of mongolian music . i would n't want to come with this guy , but it was pretty good . i could n't say i felt any disgust when the dialogue was bad . at least not for me anyway . the movie started off by playing a movie about a japanese girl who gets killed by her father . the narrator said that she ' d seen this movie before and had no interest in watching the movie , so she went home instead . the japanese girl has lots of potential and will get a nice job .|0
Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by Shag. The dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.).|1
the movie with its single set , minimal cast , and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief comedies ) . i did n't think that any character would survive a long film , let alone live it to its full potential , but that is precisely why i chose this one . you could say that my work was nothing short of spectacular . the first two episodes are simply boring . well , if you enjoyed them , do n't worry because they are no better than those in the first episode . what i really meant to tell you is that they were not good .|0
Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.The cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme.|1
after just viewing the movie , i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen . the characters are so lame it 's funny to see . and the plot is completely lacking in reality ! i 've never seen anything like this show before and i thought it would be a good way to pass my finals . the problem was that the cast only had about 2 hours to perform . they were so stupid ! what kind of character takes such an awful class ? there is n't any acting in this film .|0
finally ! other people who have actually seen this show ! it is the funniest anime i have ever seen , and i am not a fan . as a matter of fact i just watched it on a big television channel . well , i really do n't remember watching it before but i saw some pretty funny scenes in the late ' 90s . one day , this guy was on a date with this chick , he had a lot of good looks and she got into his car and went home alone . when the movie played over , she told him how she wanted to get back to her friends .|0
this is a bad film , as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was written from the bowels of some medieval castle . the main character ( who appears to be about five - three or so ) is in danger and can not see the danger and does not understand what is going on ; the ending looks awful . the acting is bad enough . why i wanted to watch this movie i am not clear . first of all , i do n't want to watch it with my brother .|0
I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible! I expected it to be great, because you know, usually we don't have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off, you really don't have anything useful at all! The director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example.|1
"A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean ""laughs"", and it doesn't necessarily mean ""light"". It basically means you're not bored while watching it. As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience."|1
grand champion is a bit old fashion at first glance . andrew morton at the fort worth star telegram said , ' that 's one of the worst performances i 've ever seen in my whole life . ' he actually made it sound bad . this was only the third time and it seems that all of the others did too . i still do n't know where to begin . when you come across these things , you can not imagine what their content would be . if you look at the tv shows that they have been airing since the beginning of the era , then you are pretty well accustomed to them .|0
Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places.|1
"""Tart"" is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"". Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that ends up someplace else. ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer."|1
i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd - - the movie you can not have . it was a great film , but i was n't sure if i would like it or not . i do n't think there was even any real emotion behind it . i did n't see many people who actually liked it , so i gave it up . it was a crappy movie , but i loved the way the characters had acting in their actions to make them feel like something more .|0
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.|1
sheltered young woman , home - schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly - emotional side which comes to the surface of everything that 's happened in this story . i ca n't imagine her as a complete failure ; she was very bright , intelligent , self - competent and had the smarts to do great things in her career . i think it was probably the only time she even attempted to write something . i do not have an idea where she learned how to write anything , or why she made it all the way up to the top .|0
this picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980 , starring stephen macht as sergeant thor , avery schreiber , richard smith , and harry potter . when i wrote this first draft of the original version i thought it would be more like a thriller , or a comedy . what i found that was even worse than the original was the idea of the actors . i wanted to film an action movie which would be entertaining but not very exciting . well , except for at least three comedic dramas in the 1970s and ' 78 . since then i just have been trying to kill time by watching the news .|0
I really couldn't get into this movie. The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. He eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets the blame.|1
the director is sweet , as is his co - directing wife shira geffen , but their movie sucks . it has a huge plot line and there is no action ( i have never heard of this show ) . i think they need a lot of good acting to make the film come out , but they ca n't seem to find the energy to get it off the ground . they are so lame and pathetic . it 's almost like they have no spirit . at least i hope they have enough energy to go out onto the stage and perform .|0
i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater . despite its local provenance ( and its relation to the film ) , you might find the quality of films more than what they actually show . the main problem with this film was that it is so bad that i could not even see a single word on it . when i looked down at it in the late afternoon sun i could see that the words were written in a very short way , as if the whole film was designed to be read in any given sentence . this was really just the most boring movie i have ever seen .|0
i ca n ' t get over the quality of the score , the book , and the performances . this is a great cover shot , and i like it much more than the rest of the work . there were some interesting parts that are funny at times , but for the most part these things just look dumb . they do n't make a thing of how we act in this film , and i want to stay out of it . the whole experience is not so bad , but there is one little flaw with the movie . the plot is totally wrong .|0
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.|1
"With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar-race this year. Part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails in delivering the ""message"" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense)."|1
I really like the show!! As a part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.Rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.This show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on ABC Family? ).My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all of Kappa Tau.|1
This is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide, all-American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly.|1
I hope this isn't a portent of things to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst.|1
without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing . i am not even sure what i was looking at . it does seem to me that this movie would be more interesting if it were a real horror movie , but since it really is one of the worst films i have seen , i think it could just be an improvement on those horrible ones in the books . unfortunately , as soon as i saw this , i felt sorry for you .|0
this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy friday afternoon . as the movie begins , i start to laugh . this movie is really depressing because it reminds me too much of my mother when she was a teenager . all the other films were so good , and they were boring , so i just decided to get into an old fashioned movie in search of something interesting . there was this little girl living with her mother who lived alone at the bottom of a well .|0
first , let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is . so the book may have been written by someone who does not even know my name . yes , this is a movie . but if you read the film , it is just as bad because the character is one of the characters who is really good at acting . if you go down to the theatre and check with the director for any type of feedback , you will be surprised at the amount of commentary that the script makes . i only know what i heard about her on the tape , and i can not remember much else .|0
i enjoyed the prequels , and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious . rh3 , however , seemed like it was doomed from the moment i set foot there . i mean , why would an old movie have that much to say about the people in the movie ? well , you will never be able to make out their faces , but it sure looks as though these two characters were extremely close . they both have this funny way of sticking together and having fun . i could only hope that this film was not going to do anything to me that made me want to take my clothes off so badly .|0
"Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after ""Next Friday"").It's basically just crap. How can you possibly call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, ""Hey, it's realistic, they have been like this."" Fine, but why bother us with it?"|1
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film.|1
"I can't quite explain why I find this so alluring and ""The Leopard"" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story."|1
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot.|1
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers, Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town.|1
wow , stella shorts are great ! lots of patrons from the state and stella , the tv show . there is no other thing that could make this movie better . i did n't even know they had an indie - based theater . i thought it must be a stupid film as i watched it over and over in my head for some reason . but i really am not sure what it is about though . maybe i can ask jason to turn it on to see how it plays . i have no idea why the plot is so bad .|0
"this movie was extremely boring . i only laughed a few times . i decided to rent it when i saw the title : "" the most exciting film ever ! "" and i found myself wanting to hang out with her all night , but i have no plans to stay . i just wanted to go home , take a bath , and see if i could get some sleep . as we were walking back to the theater , i turned to her and said , "" i like this movie . what are they doing ? "" sarah was quiet for a minute ."|0
"When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end."|1
philistines beware , especially american ones ! this has all the elements you ' ll hate - a langorous approach to a movie / film scene , and the fact that it is a production in which there are no dialogue or characters whatsoever . so far i don ' t even know what it looks like at any rate . i could only think of one type of film where it would be an excellent portrayal of hollywood . it ' s supposed to have a plot with some element , but it isn ' t . if there were a screenplay for this movie , it was probably made in california .|0
Well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. Instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.|1
i love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's Casey his sister to now where he's dating Dana.. love this show cant wait until Monday night!! Also i am so glad that cappie and Casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! As for Evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale.|1
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter!|1
In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost.|1
"When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book ""Het Gouden Ei""/the movie ""Spoorloos""(outside Holland, this movie has the name ""the Vanishing"" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that 'the American Audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free."|1
"I'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with ""Go Fever""."|1
After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia. However, the CIA safe house is broken in by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the Agency. Alone, trusting only in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia.The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill.|1
this is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production . martha coolidge herself said she only wanted to see it because it would be funny and enjoyable . i was more than happy to show it to you , but i was n't sure if this film was better than those of the movies . so i gave her my version of the ending and made a few other suggestions for the rest . there are a couple of good scenes here , though some of the dialog is atrocious . however , the actors were nice enough not to make a scene about how the characters look .|0
i knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going . but when i saw the monster in my apartment , i felt like a kid trying to learn how to use a broom . what did it do to be able to clean and cook for so many people ? the only way you can imagine being in such a state of shock was if you just sat down at your computer and watched a horror movie . this particular one had been a comedy that was about three years late . it was actually quite good . i thought it was very funny .|0
The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt {I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt tricked. They trot out about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate.|1
"SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with ""Oldboy"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, ""sang"" means ""blood"" in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim."|1
i found west point to be an agreeable film , although i doubt that i would watch it again . i have been to several of these films with my mother and dad and have loved every moment of them . after all , they were only fourteen years old when the show started . the story was about a guy who lived on the outskirts of this city and had a lot of money . he got caught up in something that he should have never done and ended up locked away . i saw him at one of the many parties he attended . there was nothing particularly entertaining about him .|0
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" or ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis."|1
the next karate kid , in my opinion , is an excellent martial arts flick . i thought that eric could have shown this movie to one of his friends - or someone - and we could have gone on with it . i 'm just so glad that a guy like eric who likes to watch movies has no problem watching them at all . what 's the point of waiting for the other person to show up ? besides , you never really know what you 'll find inside a comic book . some of the scenes here are funny ; some of the scenes are terrible .|0
Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle.|1
"the threesome of bill boyd , robert armstrong , and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand . a lot of good it 's doing , they all say as the show ends . "" you have to know who you 're looking for on the internet ! "" is an even more popular version than the first one . this movie does not look like something i would watch at my high school - it is very boring . there are also some bad things about the characters in this movie that i was not able to take the time to watch ."|0
While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged.|1
"The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics. While the theme seems common, what ""makes"" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. Ditto for the music.The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. A very canny strategy by the writer/director."|1
you belong to me ( 1941 ) is a example of the ' screwball comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s . it 's really hard to tell how long it has lasted . the actors are n't really much different from each other , except that they have a better sense of humour . when i was younger , there was a boy named michael who would get up late every day at school and walk around with his shirt off . this was one of the most boring stories i have ever seen . the film was about a kid who ran over an unsuspecting woman and she tried to kill herself .|0
normally , i do not review online , but it ' s saturday and i ' m trapped in my room , which is very dull . i was watching the same movie again this morning and had to watch it twice . i didn ' t think much of it at first , but the more i read , the more confused i became over the idea of living in the midwest . if there is any truth to the story , as i ' ve already said , then i don ' t know how i could have believed it .|0
Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier. It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime, and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian.|1
This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately!|1
"This film gives new meaning to the term ""uneven"", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him."|1
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired, it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted.|1
this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today . horribly predictable , obscene usage , and nothing to go on . there is not a thing i can do about it ! i try to come up with an excuse for what i might have been watching , but after awhile i just ca n't remember . i guess the only way to justify my lack of knowledge ( or lack thereof ) in this game is to say that it was a failure . well , i guess it 's not like i will be able to change it .|0
there were only two redeeming features about this movie ; the beauty of bucharest and its architecture , and the fact it did not offer an escape . as the film progresses i find myself feeling a little apprehensive to watch it because i always feel like someone is watching my every move . for some strange reason , the plot does seem to revolve around a certain woman that i could never get over . but this was not in any way funny . while the movie goes on , most of the other people in the movie are very easy to ignore ( especially her ) .|0
dreadful . i hope i can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this . i would suggest , for your sake , not to read too much into it . if there was ever anything in my book that makes sense ( other than being able to write the most amazing book i have ever seen ) what is this ? a great movie ? well let me put it this way , the script is great , the scenes are entertaining , and the quality of the films is fantastic , but nothing about them will be any more real than that .|0
"If you Listen to Ween (The Pod, God/Satan), then you know what's going on with ""Split"" I found that watching the film under the influence of LSD helped to deal with Audio/Video tracers from fantastic editing job. The plot was only important from second to second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...There just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level."|1
"I walked into Blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: ""Panicky kidnapped girlfriend"" (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!)"|1
simply put , there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out . the first part i thought would be good ( although it was a bit of a downer ) but not so much . as far as the third part is concerned , there is nothing really interesting to do on a saturday night . why waste your time ? the rest of this book is useless . when i finally came out from behind the curtain to take a break and have a drink , i was surprised to see someone else sitting with me .|0
this was not a good movie ! ! why do you people keep saying that ? there is a nice guy at the film school , but i thought he would be cute and funny ! who are these characters ? where are the original movies ? what 's the plot ? they are so boring ; i wanted to watch them for a minute . i feel sorry for young people like myself , especially when they have to watch all the bad movies in the movie house . as if they were not bad enough . i will tell you something even worse than most of these movies : those films really suck .|0
...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance.|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen on film, and I've viewed thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it.|1
i absolutely hated this movie . even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message , it did not make me feel any better . there were so many stupid scenes and they made me feel like a total loser for watching it . in the end i gave up on the film and moved over to watch another one . i spent most of the morning listening to music while i waited for the next episode to end . i was hoping that it would eventually go away , but by the time i saw it i could not believe that this movie had even gone out of business .|0
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie. It appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Alas, it didn't hold up.I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization.The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed.|1
this is one of the funniest movies i ' ve ever saw . a 14 - year old boy jason shepherd wrote an original book with his wife and kids in it . i don ' t think anyone would want to watch this movie , but then again i don ' t really recommend it anyway . if you go to a movie where there is nothing going on and you just watch it , you ' re not looking for anything special about it . instead you are thinking about how funny it is , how it could be hilarious .|0
the movie is apparently based on a popular french horror novel , by arthur bernede , from 1927 . not to mention the fact that i ca n't read it at all . this film was never even close to being any good . the characters of this movie are quite different from the original version , and i would like to point out that i really did not expect them to actually live as actors in this movie . i do not know if there were any real characters in this film . they just seem to have their own plot and genre .|0
incredibly , ` ` vampire assassin ' ' is significantly worse than such atrocities as ` ` tequila body shots ' ' and ` ` vampires ' . the only thing i 'm interested in right now is that they have some sort of a cult - like mentality which is completely insane . i never saw this movie before but when i was about 15 years old , i watched it with my friend david benoit . i was fascinated with what he had to say . he was just so full of himself at times that he got all choked up during the first part of his movie .|0
"Firstly, this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novella, or anything else. From EW's Web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, ""...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's ''Golden Years'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception. ""The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on."|1
"Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like ""The Avengers"" and the remake of ""Diabolique"" has directed this ripoff of the Die Hard concept, done on - what looks like - a Blair Witch budget. A California nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't Arab; they're really disgruntled American soldiers masquerading as Arabs! We find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. We're not sure what the statement is but never mind."|1
This movie could have had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course acting is needed. This film lacked both!First, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact.|1
I can only think of one reason this movie was released. To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn's memory. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this utter trash. Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.|1
This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original. 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. This has to be Jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career.|1
what a waste of talent - - although it appears that crudup in real life is a lot more like the story on tv than any of the characters i 've ever heard and i still have to laugh at myself for being so gullible . anyway , i found out this was the most exciting story i had ever seen . it seemed to be written by someone who actually believed that he would be an actor , but no one thought that he would play a villain . i did my best to write about it , but there are many reasons why i ended up ending up in this book .|0
this movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun , friendship , and a future . you should also note that all of the action was in the films . there is one last thing that strikes me as funny about this film . since we do n't have a television camera here at school , the acting was so much worse than what you see in real - life . it really messed up my parents ' expectations and made me feel like i am the bad guy . i think it was because i did n't try to save the family from themselves .|0
i ca n ' t even describe it . it ' s the worst movie i ' ve ever seen ( i ' m being honest - there was nothing remotely funny ) . and if you ' re not a friend of this film , then do you want to watch something that will be awful ? no . yes . no . that is too big . it is so bad that it ' s very boring . it ' s an old comedy about a group of teenagers running away from home with their parents who are in love with them .|0
- contains 1 spoiler , market with : * * * * * - not presenting itself as yet another remake in a different genre . i will say this for you . it would have been easier for me if my mother and dad had n't died . that was the sad part about coming to see their parents . i know this sounds stupid , since i never knew my parents at all . so what is wrong with me ? my parents died within a couple of years of each other . they had both just left the country on vacation .|0
naturally sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen , it is such a piece of sh * t . my mind is consumed with one thought that can not be dismissed . if she is in love with this loser , then i wonder why she would put herself on such a pedestal and take the risk of having me as her rebound lover . what kind of an idiot do you think i am ? there is absolutely no way that this could have happened when i first walked into this town . after all , i just signed a non - compete for my career .|0
"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of).The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes."|1
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. Besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters.|1
let me get this out of the way before i trash this film : i love park chan - wook ' s work and he really loves park , but he does it with such a goofy smile that his face looks like he just ate half of a cow . ( he 's not a movie fan at all so he will make you laugh if you look hard enough . ) when i looked around to see if there was anyone waiting in line to pay their ticket , i saw another man . i mean really , who wants to spend their money on someone else ?|0
"well it might be a kid ' s movie . . . perhaps but i ' m not gon na let my kids from high school hear about this little joke , and if you have any ideas , please share them with your parents . . . i got ta go now because i ' ve got a lot of homework waiting for me in the car . entry 2 - 140 : september 14 , 2014 
 the world of rome is a strange one 
 the characters in this story are very similar to that of the mandasurte ."|0
Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, Where's Daniel!? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. He could've helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute!|1
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in. The acting and the story was just terrible. I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses.|1
"` ` the cave ' ' got released more or less simultaneously with the english film ` ` the descent ' ' , directed by a male version of john wayne "" it ' s supposed to be a romantic comedy . it just seems like such a cliche as that ! what are we doing out here in the middle of nowhere for ? if i wanted to do something worthwhile with my life , this would be how i did it . the movie sucks . the script is so bad that i should have known it was not worth being paid to write it ."|0
I've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. I later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously.|1
historical movies always take liberties - - conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said , customs are observed and the general content is changed . i had not realized at first that the whole thing was quite so contrived as to make me feel less than excited and anxious . in fact it made me even more apprehensive of going out on a limb . there was a great deal about this film that i did n't understand , but i had no doubts that it would be extremely interesting . i really enjoyed watching it .|0
` ` driving lessons ' ' sees two middle class quintessential british families meet head on , when grint ' s character comes across as totally different than him in many ways . there is no mention of anything from the first world war , nor a word from the second . but this film is very good and i really enjoyed seeing it , especially during my first few minutes on earth . you just ca n't imagine how bad it will be to watch something like that . the only reason i am showing it to you now is because i was looking for any excuse to stay out of your life .|0
i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept of the characters and their personalities . they are so simple and straightforward . the most interesting part about this movie is how much of a character has been in the plot while the main character is not . you have to get to know them to understand just how easy it is for someone to be influenced by these characters . but if you were to see the actors , you would learn what an amazing story it was . this is one of the worst films i have ever read in my life .|0
"In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short, we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed ""Serpentine Dance"" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era."|1
this is an astonishingly bad action film . i ' d say its primary flaw is that it ' s boring . the main character is a man who ' s very handsome ( he looks like him , too ) , and his wife has big tits and a great ass . the main character is a chubby woman who seems to have had a heart attack while dancing . when the movie ends , the production manager tells everyone he ' s got to use the ladies room to call in sick or something so he can meet up with one of the women from work .|0
the plot involves a new , hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin ' s barbershop . there are quite a few things about this film that i have never even heard of before , and it makes no sense to me in the least . i find this movie utterly ridiculous , because i know that the real world is much more entertaining and interesting than what we just experienced here . it would be very bad for anyone to try and write a story like this while they are watching a movie . however , this was not something i wanted to think about .|0
all i can do is laugh . wow . i like jim wynorski ' s movies , i really do . but this movie ' s not so bad . i actually have a great idea that would make any of the movie critics envious . well , almost everyone who has watched these movies has seen them in my opinion . to be honest , i had forgotten how much i loved watching these movies ! and i made sure that i got to see this movie every day for the past two years ( and i was always good at watching it ) .|0
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought 'I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place.|1
i had heard good things about ` ` states of grace ' ' and came in with an open mind . i did n't see any way to make it real , so i decided to take a hike . i walked around the back of the store and started walking down the side of the building near the loading dock . i saw a huge pile of boxes by the wall . this was something i had not expected . there must be at least 20 tons of heavy metal on the top of the buildings . what am i thinking ? well , i do not know how hard this was going to be .|0
bad . bad . bad . those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot fans who will make it better for themselves by being an ass * * le . you see , i had a friend of mine and she is not a fan of anything i write so if you take her advice and watch this film , it is pretty good . you are not the first one to get lucky . but i was lucky too . i still have time on my hands to try and figure out what to do with this whole movie before the night is over .|0
not a box office success ; no - one really knows why . it may have failed simply because of its title , and then in the end there was a very bad ending . however , i think that this is the worst movie i have seen in my life . if it goes as well as it looks , i will be happy to take you to the next episode on the network . i know you do n't like this one , but i am willing to give it a shot . i would like to see what some of your best movies are like .|0
` ` mishima : a life in four chapters ' ' is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative clarity . ' one could see why we would have difficulty understanding it . it is the kind of work you would expect in a screenplay or on a movie set but , instead , there are many other things to consider . for example , i had never heard of any film made by an agent whose main point was not being able to be seen by the critics , but rather that he could be seen and not hear by the audience at all .|0
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote.|1
I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.Not only did Master P start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him.|1
"chris morris ' brass eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints , both from the audience and themselves . i have not seen this movie so i was surprised that there were still any reviews . well , why would they ? after reading the reviews i did not find it at all shocking . in fact , as far as i can see , the only reason that the show was on the air was because some people thought it was funny . to me , the main reason for the show was simply because there was no such thing as an "" unfunny "" or "" inappropriately - directed "" movie ."|0
i never saw doctor who before ( at least not in any focused way ) , so i was new at this game and had been playing it since i was sixteen . a couple of years later i was finally allowed to take on some real role as a writer because i learned from the best . this story is very much like my first book , but the premise is quite different . i have n't seen a lot of other people play the same game for so long , that i was surprised by it . it was really a great idea , and i was excited to go along with it .|0
teenage exorcist is one of those god - awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent film at all . you know , if it was just a movie with no plot in it i would have laughed , but it is something else and i do not like watching this kind of film . it is not good enough for some people . even if we had been able to convince many people that they did not care what happened to each other , they are pretty much on the back of the couch with their heads screwed onto the cushions .|0
pacino , and maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker . i swear , i am an avid movie fan . i will have to go to a lot of extra effort to learn to like this guy . when i was in middle school , there was this big joke on me about how my best friend could n't stand him , and he thought that i was just messing with him . you can never be too careful , if you want to know your favorite actress . it is so weird to see them together at all !|0
this is an extraordinary film . as a courtroom drama , it ' s compelling , as an indictment on the character of jack hanley . but what else is there to look forward to in the movie ? i ' ve seen more films and movies than i ever thought i wouldn ' t - not since my early childhood , when i had to watch it every weekend at our house during the winter months . i didn ' t exactly enjoy it . if you like this film , which i sincerely believe you don ' t , you can just take it for granted and be able to view it with some pride .|0
"The St. Francisville Experiment claims ""this ain't no walk in the woods"", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming! !I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's ""paranormal consultant"" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie."|1
this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on . this movie is practically mchale ' s death - line , and i could see why it was called for : the first two characters die in the movie and are released after the film gets published . this movie is a total waste of time . how can you make movies like this just because you have seen some movies that made you happy ? i wish they would do something about it , but they ' re all idiots . it ' s hard to find people worth watching these days anyway .|0
i really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a child and his wife . it is extremely good , but i could not enjoy it . no way was i looking forward to attending this movie . i spent some time thinking about it and it seems like it should have been taken as a comedy in its most interesting form . so i decided to take a look at this movie before i made my decision . you might want to know that i liked it a great deal . yes , it was good .|0
A brash, self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a role obviously tailor-made for him, William Haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. A grade-A scene stealer, Haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents.|1
if the following sounds tempting , then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie . i know some people would disagree with that idea ; it 's a total waste of time and money and should be sold off at auction . anyway , let 's get started and start now because we have n't heard from any of these guys in a week . they 've got nothing new to tell us about them . even though it 's very dull , we are all getting bored and starting to wonder if we should just watch tv or stay in bed and read our own damn books for a bit longer .|0
in the mid 1800s , irishman dennis hopper ( as daniel morgan ) emigrates to australia , seeking a share of the world . when he does , he finds that the majority of people have no idea what they are doing . i do not believe it has anything to do with love or wealth and everything to do with the fact that he is a notorious criminal . however , even if it did have something to do with this film , i doubt that it would make much difference . i mean , come on ! there was only one reason for the movies to be made ; they were bad .|0
"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian, but I am learning right now.I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the US etc.But what I have to mention is:In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent. Americans talk ""Hochdeutsch"" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Besides, this is boring.I hope the original is better.The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond film."|1
"umberto lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash . janet agren plays a lady who is looking for her old boyfriend but has yet to get him back , and i have found that i am more interested in finding out if she can play the piano as well .

` ` lets swap murders - your wife , my father ' ' - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - bruno anthony de ' s best friend in law enforcement . as soon as that is accomplished i will have to go back and find another way of killing him . this would certainly be better . but if the fbi or the department of justice think they can get anything out of it , there has to be at least one guy who could be a real help . we really ought to make sure this movie does n't go live on its own .|0
Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house.|1
"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her ""HOOKER"" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond."|1
"""Catchfire"" or ""Backtrack"" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point. Why did she agree to do this? I don't know.The hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.Worst of all, this film features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open."|1
OMG what has Disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. Suite life of Zach and Cody are pretty good but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place suck and are unwatchable.Naturally Sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. Its about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. There all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful.|1
a wasted effort . on the surface it ' s a typical disaster movie : we ' re involved in the lives of two people that i loved dearly and now despise . they ' re best friends , then go to war , then come back to see each other for a couple of weeks , then just drop dead again and die . i ' m disappointed that i thought i would like this movie to be over - the - top , but even i can see that it wasn ' t bad . there were some good laughs and some bad ones .|0
when i first heard about ` ` greek , ' ' i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous . ' i mean , for a man who thinks he has to go there in order to learn anything , he must have missed something very big and very bad . it is one of the things that i enjoy best about this film . most of all , it was an excellent movie . the ending was not terribly good but it got some good laughs from the actors , as well as a few people who liked their movies .|0
my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian . at first i did n ' t want to watch it , but i got to know him a little better on the drive there . i never had seen this movie and not one of his friends . i watched it with my best friend and he showed me some cool movies , so i felt i should learn more about the movie . the first thing that came to mind though was the most horrible story ever created . the plot was horrible , the characters were bad , and the lines were even less than they were when you started reading the script .|0
this episode sucks . over the past few years i have watched all episodes of ` ` next generation ' ' and ` ` voyager ' as a whole lot of them have failed miserably . i hope my readers enjoy it . i also hope they like it because this is one of the worst episodes ever . that was not to say it was the best or the worst movies i have seen , but it was the best . the main thing about this movie has been that there was only one scene for any of the other cinematography .|0
. . . not to waste your time watching this vanity project . i ' ve had my comment deleted twice now , but i have no intention of resorting to it again . what the hell was all that talk about in front of everyone ? and why do i have to be stuck watching this show for hours on end ? how can you watch this thing if you wo n't do something with it ? i hate this ! this show is a total waste of my time . who would ever see this show after being forced to watch it anyway ?|0
"I usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain.I don't usually watch sequels but I just had to see this since I love ""Rosemary's Baby"" so much. What a mistake that was. It simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. In fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be."|1
I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.The major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do.|1
this is n ' t ` ` so bad it ' s good ' ' - - it ' s ` ` so bad , it violates the law . ' and i thought we had some good comedy . a few of them are just great . but none of these people have a thing to say about anything . they all seem like they want to be on tv and in magazines . well , you can ' t really blame them . at least you can pretend that it ' s a normal film . no one even asks for popcorn . everyone keeps looking bored .|0
with a cast like this , i knew the acting would be amazing . still , i was cautious , not wanting to risk getting in the way of my talent . so i worked on my act for two weeks and only managed to get around a few lines . it was n't bad . at least when i was making my films , all i could do was try to make some sense of everything that happened during the film . there are times i feel like i am living in another time - space , as if i was looking at another reality show .|0
thomas mann ' s controversial novel is the basis for the film ` ` a death in venice . ` ` although in the first half of it this movie was very amusing , it has little to recommend it as an art form ( but i thought it would do well ) and has nothing about how people were murdered . i have no idea why we are being called out on this assignment . i don ' t know what to do with this , so let ' s not say anything about it . it will only cause unnecessary embarrassment in my opinion .|0
i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there . very disappointing , but just the same . the second film is that of a woman with red hair ( it 's my favorite movie ) who is having an affair with a police detective who plays as a bodyguard for her husband - he has no family to defend him from his enemies . after being arrested for what he saw in the video , he was told to get out of town and find some other girl to be his lover .|0
i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life , but none are coming to mind right at that moment . i did n't enjoy it , so i decided this movie was not the greatest . the plot is pretty awful , but it made me think about something else . who knows what else they can do with this kind of film ? if you want to watch this stupid movie , then go ahead ! there is a bunch of funny characters - one of them being an indian chief , who has been arrested for killing a band of indians .|0
i ' ve seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute antithesis to it . what do they expect from a film where the people who work with you actually have real feelings for you ? there is a very obvious reason behind this film , but we just don ' t understand how anyone can possibly want to watch this movie . let me start at the beginning - the only thing i can tell you about the plot is that it ' s totally ridiculous . first of all , it doesn ' t make any sense whatsoever .|0
"""The Journey"" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), ""The Journey"" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home."|1
i mean , nothing happens , 5 dumb kids go to oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana . . . why would he do this ? and why should he ? it 's illegal to live on the road in oklahoma , right ? how come there are so many drugs and people who have no reason to live on the highway ? at least we know what is happening in the country now , if you get me . my parents ' lives are being ruined . i wish i was able to go to one of their shows . but that would only make this worse for the rest of my life .|0
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema . shot in the southerncalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style , the film was a lot of fun to watch for the first time ever . i have seen it with my dad and he would never say why it was good but it was very good . i love it when he tells me about this movie ; it makes me feel good knowing that the characters are doing what is right because they want to do something right . also , there is nothing more romantic or exciting than movies like this .|0
"this movie was completely stale and uninspired . the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical bullshit . i mean , i had never seen this movie before - in fact , i have never seen one of these stupid movies - and i do n't think most people can understand what it is like for the world to see this movie . i could tell that my first reaction after seeing it was "" oh my god ! who did this ? "" i was hoping that it would be a bad one . it was hard to figure out how anyone would get into such a thing ."|0
sweet , rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of her , she has to prove herself as well . i never liked him , it just seemed that he was way over his head and had no other place to go . i would be lying if i said that this movie is not boring . but it is nothing compared to what i have seen with my own eyes , especially the horror . i can not even begin to imagine how dreadful it must feel to watch something you love turn into such a parody of yourself .|0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Hans Keller - I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it.|1
"arnold fans will holler in joy , fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment , and catholics will just jump in and say , "" that was so great . i have no idea what happened to this movie . "" my guess is that it was probably one of many movies that people had watched a million times , but somehow they were never able to capture the essence of what happened . not that i blame them for wanting to get back in the good books . those characters did not look like villains . they looked more like middle eastern terrorists trying to blow up a city ."|0
"In yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called ""Women Who Kick Butt"", but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, during most of the movie Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie."|1
"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""Letyat zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the verge of WWII. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war starts. Boris is promptly sent off to war. Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son, whom she does not love."|1
doe - eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie , making it somewhat amusing to watch . one of the first things i noticed about this movie was the fact that it seemed to take up less than half of the screen . i have never been able to pay attention to why these movies were so boring . they do n't seem to interest me a bit , but if you are going to be a fan of any of the films you might as well learn the plot and feel like you should be doing something about it .|0
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares?|1
"this movie is # 1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen , with ` ` lessons for a young woman ' - the greatest ! i ca n't wait to hear what she does when she is ready . 
 "" it 's so good , "" i tell my husband when we are at home after a day of working in the fields as a farm boy , "" i am sure that you would love it . there is nothing better than seeing one of your kids walk through life on a farm . i never felt quite like this before , not even when i was an only child ."|0
okay they tell you it ' s real . they do n ' t list any screenwriters or directors , but one viewing is more important than the other three . this movie was really good . the main character was not very original and he was a total pain in my ass . his story was predictable and uninteresting . what kind of characters were there ? what type of acting was necessary ? where did they come from ? why were they here ? what are they doing here anyway ? i don ' t have an answer for that .|0
"I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one more season. But when the end came closer I was exited to see that. And what did we get? This episode called ""NOT FADE AWAY"" was the very last one.I was so disappointed by this episode. This is absolutely the worst way to this series. Why couldn't it get a happy ending? Why did have a few of the main characters to die? Why did Angel not become a human and was reunited with Buffy again? No."|1
i enjoy science - fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that ? apparently shot over the fence by an ex - movie star . now he spends his days doing nothing except eating and playing video games . i know i love science fiction but at this point i really do n't care what movies are . there is no point in reading the title of a book when i can just walk away and not have to read about it either . so what if it has been filmed before , right ? all the same , i ca n't take credit for the director 's work on this one .|0
oh what a disappointment this movie is . i ca n ' t believe it was directed by wajda . there ' s no way to have that kind of attitude when you know you really should have been in the movies . as a child i could see some people acting like they had all the time in the world . now , i saw an actor act like this before but never like this . if you watch a bunch of stupid flicks and make fun of them , these guys are the most disgusting characters i have ever seen .|0
"This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. It is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. And that comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so flipping bad, it made ""Hulk"" (The second worst movie ever) look like ""The Departed"" (One of the greatest movies in cinematic history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie."|1
". . . means ` ` take up and read ' ' , which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen it . when the film started this morning , the whole world seems to have taken up a little of the time that it would have normally taken to get through the rest of the day , and i just could n't understand why nobody else was on the bus . so i sat there watching the movie hoping that i might learn more about how they can do things like this in the last twelve months or so , and i did learn a lot .

I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But perhaps that was because I never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, I have to say it was no way better than number 5. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects.|1
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours, I can't seem to forget this haunting film. A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.The actors, though not that well known are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances.You believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. The direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect.|1
jim henson ' s the muppet movie is a charming , funny and brilliant film that can be watched and enjoyed in a predictable manner . if you like this film , please leave a review or review of it . i will make sure to give your reviews to my colleagues in the theater . i hope you liked it because there was a lot of fun at the end of it . as soon as i made this , i felt a little disappointed that i was not looking for an interesting ending , but i quickly got used to the idea that it was a good story .|0
"Wow. Just wow. Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then i happened to come upon ""Lady Frankenstein"". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on Italian TV, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like i have, as number 24. And lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here."|1
spoilers . this review has been edited due to word limit . ` the horror . the horror . ' marlon marx is an unusual character for a person of his caliber . when i heard the story i thought it was hilarious at first , but after reading and re - reading it , i found it more humorous . i have not read this film yet , but if i ever do , i would like to see where it went wrong . my guess is that there are some pretty good actresses who have actually made quite a few movies .|0
lovely . i just love the movie . i want to see this movie because rupert grint is a fantastic character . he loves his children , and does everything they do , including taking them to the movies . in my opinion , if it were not for these characters , i 'd have given him a kick - ass book . the plot is so bad as to take me back several months ago to see the original ! i hated watching this movie . oh , how i wish that i had seen it when i had time to watch it back then . what a waste .|0
this movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy , just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this film was so much more entertaining . i have seen this movie countless times , mainly because i did not like the plot at all . it was funny enough when it was first released , but i never really got to see it as a real film in any other genre . this movie is just too good to be true . for one thing , it is poorly executed , and the plot sucks . however , i think the overall outcome is very good .|0
"""The Journey"" is a romantic version of the cold war. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956. She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.Of course, the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip."|1
"Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy ""The Grissom Gang"", a reworking of the 1948 British film ""No Orchids For Miss Blandish"", has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her."|1
A rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later? ), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...It's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due.|1
Love this little film, that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown Gere/Jlo remake...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!!|1
i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight . i must say , i was quite impressed by the overall quality and execution in the film . it did not get much worse than this one . although my experience as an actor has improved tremendously , i feel that the actors are actually more inept at portraying their role than the actors themselves . i am really glad that i saw this movie earlier this year and i just hope that we have not made any major errors in the first two months after the film started . i really do not like having to go back to school .|0
ken russell directed this weird ( not very ) erotic thriller and if i had n ' t known that i would have read this one . please do not laugh at me for letting it get this far . i just ca n't help myself . the sex was too intense , the act too hot , and the plot was just too much to handle . i got bored of reading the same paragraph three times before i made it back down to the original script . i felt like my life was on fire . i spent hours in the dark editing this book from its beginning to end .|0
Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life.|1
This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I'd never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction.Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I'd fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't. She no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination.The movie has some cute moments.|1
when a loser teen is bitten by an insect , he becomes the superhero dragonfly . . . superhero movie is the most dangerous movie i have ever seen . not that it matters , but the horror films are so much worse - even for me , who has never seen anything like this before ( except for the first time as a young child at my high school ) . there is something totally wrong about this show ! i am going to put this down and read some more of these movies in a few days . you may not see this now , but soon , it will all make perfect sense .|0
"what can i say about this ? such a big prestige - production - but in the end ? wasted time , it went on and on like that until one day , while walking home from school , i saw my best friend talking to the girl at the corner . there was a lot of gossip floating around about her and his family and the fact that he had a girlfriend , but when i looked closer , i saw that she did not have a boyfriend . after that , i never saw anything else .

"One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit I never got into the original show.... Okay, so I never watched it at all. But the new show is impressive.Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows."|1
helen ( kate capshaw ) owns a bookstore in the sleepy , coastal town of loblolly by the sea . she is a very passionate woman , and is one of the best bookstores in the county . it may seem like a cliche for a single woman to write a novel about an author , especially when she is doing the work of a fictional man . there is such a thing as a good book , and i am looking forward to going to the library with this book . i just could not imagine what it would be like to spend my free time studying this .|0
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more. The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending.|1
if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film . it would n't surprise me if i had seen the movie three times before i actually saw it . i will have to watch it again very soon and we all know there is going to be a sequel coming along on its way , but how long are you planning to go on waiting ? when i get back to my home office , i will need to change out of my uniform and start work on the first movie that i have ever seen .|0
"Two years after this movie was made, ""The Juror"" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See ""The Juror"" instead. ""The Juror"" is essentially the same story as ""Trial By Jury,"" with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her."|1
"A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. Nicknamed ""Good Time Charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's Lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact."|1
"this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a ""is this for real??"" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this! !"|1
Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.Presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. This sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. Don't go out of your way to see it.|1
being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london , i was very excited to see this movie . i thought it might be an interesting subject matter on tv , so i thought i would look it up on my ebay . as you may know , i had a great time during the two weeks i lived in france , but i did n't get much enjoyment out of it . it was about ten minutes after midnight when i found out what the movie was all about . i have seen lots of movies , but not this one .|0
"This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being ""weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students"". Sorry TV writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality."|1
"This is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, ""Watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick. "".What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many that can pull it off like Bob Hoskins but he isn't in this one."|1
At least for me. I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. Also, the singing scene was just weird. I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.As Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense.|1
this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen . i would think you could get that from a movie . what makes it so bad is that the main character can be made to look better , but he has not done any of the action sequences because of his dislike for them . in fact the only one that really gives a crap is the director . at the end of the film , the cast comes up with four different movies : the first one and the second one . the production is poor , the screenplay is awful , and the script is mediocre .|0
christopher nolan ' s first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out . shot on a night - old television show that he had won a prestigious award in a game of monopoly . although the film , however , is not quite as popular as the others , it is much more realistic than any other action movies we have seen . i am still amazed at such a quick change from the one i was expecting to see on my first day in the office . and i am very impressed with how many changes the films make over the last three years .|0
while not truly terrible , this movie is still largely a waste of time , and paints an incredibly inaccurate picture . in fact , i was just reading through some of it when i found out that the film ' s character has been doing some really weird things since he ' s born . there ' s no point in worrying about them at all , so what am i doing ? i ' ve come to realise that the only reason people are allowed to get into this film is because they want to do something good - something worthwhile .|0
I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from.|1
"I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish ""Origin of Species"". Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life."|1
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. The leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. So, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to Iraq war and Black Water Company.What a load of leftest excrement!|1
This is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography.|1
I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue.|1
"what a mess - - and i ' m not referring to the ` ` destruction ' ' in the title . i could give a good story about how all of this is going down , but i don ' t think any of you are likely to hear it or like it . "" "" do you have any idea what these guys did ? "" asked preston .

"this film was very different form the previous films and i had to wonder , ` ` where is ralph macchio ? it seems so simple . but it is not simple . i thought that it would at least be funny if we could make a joke about "" how to get out of poverty "" or "" what to do when you are on your way to college . "" but the truth is that there is just too much going on for us to laugh . i have n't felt this good in my entire life . no one knows what to say when someone does this , because nobody has ever asked them ."|0
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels.|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before?|1
"After a meteorite lands in ""Boston"" (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. This isn't."|1
"Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself ""this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...."" then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie."|1
i ' d buy that for a dollar ! ! ! i did buy this film for a dollar and i bought it by a dollar . i bought it on a whim . i didn ' t even know the whole thing was about to go down in hollywood . i was just too scared to find out ! if you would rather watch this video , let it be aired in a movie studio somewhere where they can do some work . i could really get my money ' t i ? ! i ' ll be able to pay all of my $ 25 for it .|0
badly shot , badly edited , clumsy dialogue , flat characters , unsuccessful adaption of a novel . it does not take much imagination to realize that this is the worst movie i have ever seen . one of the worst movies i have seen in my entire life has been taken away from me by the greatest film of my life . yes , it is bad , but you need to love the movie . it is the most amazing thing that has ever been put on television . the plot is simple and delivers a good story line . the ending is very sad .|0
this film was probably the best ` ` scary film ' ' i ' ve seen in years . chilling might be a better word . i read all of the screenplay , and knew there was something strange going on here , but i thought it was just my imagination trying to throw me out of the nest . i never wanted to see this movie for myself . i always wished that i would not have gotten into it at all . i do n't even know why i ever got into it . i had very few friends , as you can imagine .|0
"My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. Blame that on shows like ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series."|1
"This really is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. The further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their ""acting"". I viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! The location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. I suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard."|1
i remember watching this mini - series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation . having seen it , i found it quite difficult to understand why my wife had not written the book . how could she make such an effort just to write that stupid piece of crap ? i mean , even if you do n't know who did this , you should at least want to see what they look like . we are not exactly the type of readers to think there is nothing good on tv , let alone in real life .|0
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product.|1
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class. And some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. AND FAILED.That is my only explanation for this, this, thing. Good God they left the date and time counter on during some of it. The picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot.|1
* * * * * i reveal two ' twists ' at the end of the film . do not read more into this story that it really was just a movie and i must say , it looked great on my television . however , the characters are a bit slow - witted , so i hope you enjoy this book because it is quite funny . let me just say that this is one of the best comedies i have ever heard about . the premise is totally lacking in structure , plot and substance , with no plot and no style .|0
"Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar, it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.The plot line may have been a little thin, but what B movie isn't. I understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging every movie like it is an Oscar contender, just silly."|1
ok the box look interesting , the opening have great music and its kinda original , to that its all pretty good but we should be thinking of a little more action . i could n't get any new work done and i just got a bad one so i really ca n't edit this one . there 's something in it about a young woman who plays guitar and is able to do so much better than most of the critics in the audience . the way i see it there is no hope for success because she only gets as many hits on her own record as she has on her other albums .|0
"A CBS radio program entitled ""We the People"" assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who is ""studying"" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Ms. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. Immediately."|1
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! How can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? Maybe part II will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! I have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!|1
"this is marvelous movie , about a soul of ale . this is a journey to ale ' s heart . i do not know if the plot was even written in the last few days , but i am sure that you will appreciate how funny it is . some of the characters were obviously drunk and very immature , or so the story says . there are a few times when i have to say "" excuse me "" for making this film . the ending is bad enough , but the end is really awful . i have always thought that the main character should be a boy from a different generation ."|0
"I've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled onto ""Cidade de Deus / City of God"". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER than ""City of God"".The acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of São Paulo.I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.Something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on."|1
i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night . frankly , i have never heard about such a horror movie before . it is so much like that film that i was sure it could n't possibly have been produced at any of the movies . it was a comedy in every sense of the term , and i know that these are not the most romantic movies ever made . but they really were one of the best . there is a lot of yelling and swearing from everyone . i just wish they had told us more about how we got involved or why our friendship ended .|0
Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'The Street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the American productions.There was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'.|1
"they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer - to make them more interesting or something . "" i sat back and said , "" so this guy is a ghost ? "" "" what kind of ghost ? well , let me be frank , i do n't know who he is . but if you ever see him , please do not give him a piece of your mind . "" "" why not ? "" i asked . 
 "" he is a ghost . "" "" does he have anything to do with the murders on the film ? """|0
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ""The Origin of Species"", so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's ""Creation"" got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.I guess that the movie overplayed Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma."|1
when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special . the acting and camera angle were so bad it almost made you feel sorry for the guy . i had a feeling that the film would be about the same , but the ending seemed completely different than the last one . they both had very bad grammar which was terrible . the director really did n't have a clue what to tell people about his show . he just acted out of desperation , like he desperately wanted to keep filming . there was an obvious underlying message here , but we could n't figure out exactly how it was accomplished .|0
this movie is something horrible . i was laughing all the time . i was forced to stop in some very funny moments , and had to laugh my way through the entire thing . but this one was terrible . there was so much that happened , i never wanted to witness another movie like this one . i have seen more of the same films over the past twenty years . even though the plot has been boring at times , you can usually tell that it 's not good . it just makes you want to puke .|0
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking.|1
i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are n ' t stories , but the way he tried to say them . as if this were some sort of science fiction novel ! i had no clue that the man who was trying to kill me was going to be a writer , but this is obviously a new one . it 's also hard to believe that an indie film produced in the late ' 90s could actually have been produced today . how can you ever imagine something that so many writers do ? and then there are those two movies that still baffle me .|0
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombard. And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American didn't bring war here. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused.The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people.|1
"I rented this type of ""soft core"" before, but I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as ""Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die""--which was both sexy AND funny. It had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason why I didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the ""Must be 18 to Rent"" Sticker. I was looking for more ""cheese"" and less ""cheesecake."|1
does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents . one edition featured charles bronson ( robbie coltrane ) , and another feature had an actress in it . i ca n't remember the third movie that was a bad choice because there are lots of other movies that made me laugh and feel better than they did . most of the original ones were pretty good too , so i do n't expect to see much of what happened at this point . all of the original comedies were based on ' old school ' movies from the ' 70s .|0
There was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. One common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.Down Periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. Not an original or terribly well written screenplay. A few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case.|1
` ` lackawanna blues ' is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s . a great film has been made by people living in the midwest and have not been sold in the last 20 or so years , and i do not know how much longer they will live . however , it has had a major impact on my life for the past 10 years , when i was a young college student working as a journalist at a magazine in new york state . one night , i went to bed drunk , and woke up with an erection .|0
"' identity . . . . i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it ' s all so confusing . i found myself looking down at what appears to be the old woman in the wheelchair . i could see that we were running through a long corridor but there were people everywhere walking around , some had masks on but they didn ' t speak to us .

"despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson , this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer . by all accounts it is far from good . however , the acting is not bad ( at least not in the ' 30s ) . some of the "" action "" is really funny , although i am still unsure as to what is so funny about it . why does it even take a person that has been with the beatles to get him to go out on a date with them ? i believe the reason for the movie is simply because he had a crush on them ."|0
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing.|1
So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc.|1
sam o ' steen , the film editor on the superlative suspense flick ` ` rosemary ' s baby ' ' from 1968 , here to see how it goes ' ! ! ! ! ! you will be so amazed . it ' s an awesome thriller that is not only entertaining for those who actually read it , it makes for great entertainment . however , we do not know how this novel will end up . i was one of the last ones to have this book written because i am very good at the writing and storytelling part of being a detective .|0
"(Contains really bad Spoilers) So what can I say about this....It's a really HORRIBLE and AWFUL movie! !.Too much CGI and special effects....you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is! !.PLEASE at least go watch ""Dungeons and Dragons"" which is another terrible pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons way better!!! Uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap!!!!!!!!!!! !I Hate this Trash!!"|1
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z.|1
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it . who cares about the plot or the plot ? all we have to worry about is the script . you might as well just see the whole film , because that would be so much better than trying to think up something else . now if you want the full story i will give you a rundown . first off , i hope you do n't judge this movie by its premise , but for me it was an epic disaster . the worst movie ever made in my entire life was on youtube .|0
daft potboilers do n ' t come much dafter than this , but it ' s a douglas sirk movie which makes everything seem so much funnier . you will not even be able to tell what it looks like after viewing it . the first thing i saw as soon as i stepped inside was a screen of water in the middle of a large pond and the most interesting thing i could see were people walking around the water with cameras in their hands . the camera panned down to an area only a few feet from the pond and the scene quickly changed .|0
"this is the best work i have ever seen on television . the story is compelling - - all the more so because it is based on the characters in the film , and includes the scenes from a lot of different cultures that make for interesting stories . what i found particularly fascinating about this story was the fact that they were acting like children while acting like adults as well . the dialogue is awful , the dialogue is very predictable , and the dialogue is horrible . i had no idea that it could be called "" funny "" at all !"|0
In short this movie was awful.I understand it's a Disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. HOWEVER, i must say this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store.|1
Sorry I couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ain't.|1

This is a total piece of crap. It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert. They have mangled the story and characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).The 1984 movie was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best.|1
"The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."|1
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ;D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.So as not to spoil anything, I wont go into detail...but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel.|1
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I would predict Andy Warhol might make--airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movie's rough, real-looking cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, yet dictating reality to the viewer. The only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device.|1
"The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called ""Whites"" win. However, the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between."|1
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see it.In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project. Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor.|1
korine ' s established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive image - maker . the promotional posters for mister ' s movie do not contain anything of real importance . there are too many similarities to even consider that mister ' s film can be considered a work in progress , but it is a good way to describe his character : he is an artist of some caliber , and has done well to maintain the overall image of his former life . i saw mister ' s movie on the internet one night while working at my job as a programmer .|0
as a non - theist im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago . let me see what we are looking at in the movie . it is so good you can actually feel it with all your attention and enthusiasm . how did this book differ so much from the others that were originally published ? there was very little of the actual film to be seen ( except maybe for the part where i was able to see a lot of black people ) and even less of the original production .|0
this is one of my 3 favorite movies . i ' ve been out on the water since i was 13 , and not a bad movie , but the characters were so unfunny that even though i watched it , i really did like the plot . i thought i was doing ok as i sat in the car with the windows down , but now i just want to go home and get some sleep . i still feel kind of weird from watching this movie without having the chance to see where it is going . if only they would let me spend more money .|0
televised in 1982 , from a los angeles production , this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage performance . what i have to say is that i am totally shocked to find out that the show was made in 2004 . this is no surprise at all . the audience was so disappointed in the production that they spent a great deal of time asking questions about why it should be shot in the first place instead of being filmed in the first place . you can get me on the web if you pay a lot of money for an unflattering movie .|0
one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun / exciting for the cast and audience . what i really thought at the time was that the director was an idiot , which is just what i would have liked to see . when the credits roll , there are still a lot of people who ca n't take their eyes off those two movie stars while they play the starring role - if they can even call it a role at all . the show is pretty much like some classic horror film with no plot or ending .|0
the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience.|1
this film is a great rampage of action and comedy , it gets right in to it right from the beginning . but you know how you guys can be so naive when you get to where you are , you have to assume that your life will be over soon . there is nothing else to say about this film . do n't read anything into this movie or i think you would be disgusted . if you ever like something , go for it ! look at the other movies being made ; see what they got with the characters and then make your opinion up to them .|0
after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it , oh no i ca n't . i was in for a treat this time . that 's exactly what i need to do . my hands were shaking so badly when i typed out the final words but as i scrolled down i managed to get it to make sense . i could n't believe how much i had wanted to write this . there was nothing in the box that looked good . i am sure you can guess which one was mine because you would never have believed they were ever made by a single girl .|0
the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie . this was just one of several things i thought were very funny and even amusing about my friends , but it was also very scary to see what they would think as an action movie . i felt bad for everyone else who was forced to watch it when it was so late at night , but it was not that bad . i could imagine being stuck in this movie with other people watching it over and over and doing the same thing .|0
"the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low - budget film . on its surface , the movie tells the tale of a friend and family member being murdered . to make it interesting , the "" killer "" goes through this series with a different ending than that of the other two , but it is very much an accurate portrayal of the crime scene . in this movie , both victims ' families are treated fairly . there are lots of differences in the sex scenes . each victim loses their virginity at the age of eighteen . they must have had sex as a child and were not raped at all ."|0
this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough . the acting and plot are n ' t that impressive , but it makes for an odd looking set - up . it should be called a movie , but if i was a film fan i would have been able to figure out that this might have been a play . the actors are not exactly good at being entertaining . they are just as much of a pain in the butt as they are a comedic villain . the dialogue is so bad you can barely hear what they are saying .|0
well, what can i say. WHAT THE F**K? There really isn't much to say about this, really. The only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.ACTING- VERY UNCONVINCING! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Rip-off of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful!Gore- Really not believable. In one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc.|1
i was forced to watch this film for my world reigonal geography class . this film is what is wrong with this movie , and it 's so boring that i hate it ! i have no idea how i get into this , but i would dearly like to be able to take a walk in the park and see the people of this country when i am a little kid . i could go for a stroll through a village , but i do n't want to be around people who can not tell me what to do .|0
This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and her children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.This movie is based on a true story--like Jesse James was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader.|1
`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'.|1
i was hoping to like this movie , to settle in for an evening of goofy fun . i like it a great deal better than that . and i especially enjoy watching people being murdered . the plot is not too bad . the first two episodes are very boring . i thought this film might have had some entertaining moments , but it was n't as funny as this one . there were so many times i wished i could see this movie , to see the end result . i just wish i did n't have to watch it now . i just hope it will be enough to pass the night .|0
"the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what ? i ca n't say i blame him . i 'm sure there are a lot of people out here who have gone through that , but i would be surprised if they were allowed to go into the field themselves . "" he laughs again . "" it was just such a great idea . this is not one of the real things , as you know . i mean , i am pretty sure these guys want to play basketball for their school , or maybe they just want to watch football on television ."|0
"""Rififi"" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. Jules Dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the Hollywood glamour of ""Ocean's Eleven."" The robbers in ""Rififi"" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence."|1
i was on a british airways flight from london to new york when i saw this movie . i wish i knew who it was . the director seemed to be really good at his job , and i always get the feeling that he just got bored with movies too fast in his career . anyway , this movie has been there for an hour or so , and i felt a bit sorry for its owner because she looked so much like my mother . the only thing more depressing than the episode is not being able to see the actual action or characters .|0
although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 ' s , others do n ' t quite make it . they seem to have a pretty decent story which is good enough for you . i like what i see and i think that we can use this movie ( as a very good cover ) , so why not take a break ? there must be a few people here who would appreciate it if they could just spend the whole time watching the show and seeing how it really ends . i guess it may even be nice to watch it without being bored out of my mind .|0
this is a movie that deserves another look - - if you have n ' t seen it for a while , or even after it has n't seen the film . i 'll recommend it to the producers if you are interested . if not , come see me later . and do not stay out too late , either . as long as you are there you will want to watch it at least once in your short life . i really think you should make some decisions before making any of them . one thing i did notice when i saw it was that the story was a little strange .|0
this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts . it suits them well . it makes a great movie , and the good part about it is that it 's one of the few comedians i ever watched . he made an awful film in the early 80s when he was young and had no idea what he was doing at all . not only did he miss his life at work , but he got sick before he even made it to the top of the food chain . that movie has become something of a sore spot between the director and the directors .|0
"I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in ""robot"" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole ""plot"" isn't a robot either.The whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the acting...This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of ""Star Crystal""."|1
no , no , no . that is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film . when the film is finished , it will be a great relief to all the fans on the island . i promise it will not be one of those movies where people tell people they have seen the film before . as a movie director i can make good choices , but when you go back to being a ' producer ' and look at what happened to your husband , i think you should watch the first half of his movie . i want him to be happy again .|0
I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. The cast was made of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. The story line is great too. The thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea.|1
this is my first deepa mehta film . i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its short films , and it did quite well . i mean , i enjoyed it immensely , though it does not make me want to laugh . i think i like this movie . there is nothing that makes me believe that anything good would come out of it . but it is one of the best films i have ever watched . the dialogue is awful and the actors are really bad , but it works so well that i do not think anyone can get any fun out of it .|0
not too many people seem to know about this movie . which is too bad because i think it ' s very interesting . there was no way i could have found it , except that i got the film from a friend of mine , who saw the movie , so i borrowed it . i had to borrow it in order to stay alive while my parents took off for a trip . when we get back to our room , we notice that there is a huge pile of clothes on the bed . at first look , i thought they had been thrown out .|0
brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america , and a reputation for making movies both popular and bad . no one likes this film , i 've told you that before ! it is not very good but then i have n't watched enough of this film to see if it can make me happy or depressed . what really worries me is the lack of any other comedies on this film . i am hoping that all of them will come across as good , because i do not feel that there is a single reason to keep watching this movie .|0
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. The stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. But then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. This movie ranks just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling.|1
first of all , i have watched this show since i was a little toddler , and i have always hated that it has been filmed in the middle of the night . you may have heard something about this , but i will not bring it up because it makes me feel bad for some reason . there is some good about this , so please believe me when i say that this movie is one of the worst comedy of its kind ever . it seems that even though the actors know everything they are saying , they do not know much at all .|0
this is the kind of movie which is loved by 50 - year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in some ways to make it a part of their personal history but have no understanding of what they are doing . the characters are rather simple and predictable . the character is very funny with just one thing or another . that is all . when i am trying to be an author , i do n't expect any of these things to be on television . i guess i thought something was going to happen , and maybe it has .|0
"The most amazing film I have ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw. I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U.S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way."|1
i went into this movie with an open mind . i had been too lazy to go to the video store and get my car out of the lot so i thought i could borrow a car . it 's a big thing in dundee , but there was n't much to be found on the ' gpg ' sites . they looked like they would be easy enough to buy online . i decided to go for something else . i was about to board a private plane to new mexico when i realized that what i was looking for just might not be there .|0
peter strauss , by nature of appearing in mini - series and made - for - tv films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of credit for that . i love a good sci - fi action film ; i loved to watch the movie but did not find it exciting until i had watched the movie with my mother and brother . i could have bought this one just for fun so i may have actually liked it . however , if you like the sci - fi genre please recommend it to someone at school who can tell you how to get into the ' secret ' world .|0
"""Ahh...I didn't order no amazing hit show"".....""We'll you got one"" Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I flicked on the t.v. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate."|1
OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That's the case here.|1
"to make this short and sweet: i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the ""gener-asian"" of american film making. the acting was sub-par, relying on stereotypes, raised voices, and exaggerated eye-buggery to convey its message. chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry/frustrated/distant/uncommunicative asians. these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. i like to think that us asians are more complex than that.i came out of the movie unconvinced."|1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... You will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...It really pisses me of that viewers gave Reba 6.7 on their voting...Sure i knew there are some people with IQ lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them!|1

It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys.|1
there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it . i have no idea how the screenplay for this film works or who is behind the plot to make it go forward , but even then i do n't know why the director wants me to come in early . not only did we get one of the highest quality actors , but he actually went on to make several films that were a bit different than the original . i spent a lot of time reading the books i was handed as part of this trilogy . they all seemed very boring and predictable .|0
"fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels . there were loose ends with the writing that were tied back to this book - one thing that i had learned in a few hours ' learning is that the best actor is usually an actor who can keep his thoughts off of the action , but when the movie begins , he finds himself feeling more like an old dog that has forgotten to wag his tail for a week . if it were anyone else in my class , i would probably have gone nuts . here goes : 
 1 ) what is your favorite movie ?"|0
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw. The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. You can't see anything in this movie. It is way to dark. The parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done so much better then this.|1
"Yesterday I watched this tv production, and I was very disappointed.I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the ""turn off""-switch.The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients, and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations."|1
**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PLOT ****Woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . Oh did I mention the rape victim was mute ? That`s the problem with MS 45 , Thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? Surely the whole film would have better if we had Thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ?|1
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past.|1
yesterday i watched this tv production , and i was very disappointed . i did n ' t have big expectations when it was made up of people in the middle ages who had no idea that they lived in another time and place . the first episode was a disaster . i do n't know what happened to the original show , but after seeing all the films , i decided to go live and see for myself . i am sure that the director is going to want to make sure that the same thing happens again .|0
The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist.|1
"i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the ""realism"" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the ""little"" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it."|1
i ' ve rent the movie because i ' m very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i ' ve also made it a personal pleasure to watch this movie . even if you are going to be watching one , i hope you know what you are getting yourself into when you choose to watch it . in fact , my advice to you : never watch this movie again unless you absolutely have to watch it . do not waste time looking for a sequel . that would be awful . however , i ' ll warn you .|0
yumiko ( wakana sakai ) , the pretty adopted daughter of a recently - deceased japanese businessman , inherits control of her family 's business . this is where she gets to be a bit of an ass * * le at times , and this was one of those times . although it was only two days before the wedding , most of us thought it was the worst honeymoon we had ever gone on . there was literally no room for anything else . i got bored in the last couple of hours and went to bed because i knew that i would never go back to sleep unless i had some entertainment .|0
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. Park's newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes, that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean, and uniquely Park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop.|1
I would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was awesome just the same.I also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one.|1
Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Following a few random prisoner deaths, Rackham takes in Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Luckily for everyone, Barbara Bach just happens to be on the island too! Unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.This Italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a dash of WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff.|1
this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts . even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another , but it 's never as good as the movies are made to look at . i 'm beginning to wonder if any of this has happened in real time or if it was all a movie show . i 've seen these shows and i still ca n't believe that most of them are real . why is this film not filmed in real life ? i mean how can they be filming an american movie where there are only twenty or thirty people on board ?|0

"""The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo.

For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living.|1
i realise it ' s very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie ( which was grandiose ) , but how many of the words you get from that particular film ? this film was written at least 6 more years after the 1920s . if you want me to be honest - there is an extremely good number of films involving young men , mostly girls and women . i am not going to bother to answer your question , or even mention it to you in case you have wanted to look into the matter further .|0
Badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners.David is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an IQ below sea level.|1
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. So FBI-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police.|1
ostensibly , hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother , a nagging wife , or a woman who spends her waking hours in the library trying to make money from her children . the only reason they get on at all is the lack of real talent . as such , they 're never able to play anything that makes any sense . you can understand why it would be difficult for them to play musical chairs ; they were very good at their job and made quite a name off this show .|0
I'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white, foreign tourist. They picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager.|1
"This noisy, dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy, who could have tackled the role played by Mr. Stone, the team doctors, or the ""fruitcake"" selling cereal. If you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. The film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some MTV-styled music video scenes."|1
"sci - fi channel thinks this is sci - fi ; it ' s a shame . big bugs , snakes , mythical beasties , and scary stuff that should be comic relief , instead they ' ve just been bad things . i would have enjoyed the horror if it hadn ' t been directed by an alien race from another galaxy . why are n't there any monsters ? 
 "" hey ! "" someone called behind me , startling me to death . i thought for a second i ' d come upon some kind of strange monster ( or monster , as the case may be ) ."|0
i went into this movie determined to like it . i usually enjoy dramas like wall street , glen gary ' s horror , but this one has a really good character - ending with the bad guy who got caught and the bad guy gets away with murder . as a teenager , i saw a few movies about crime in my time when i was a kid . most were funny enough , but the scenes where they are not funny at all were even worse . so i did n't like the movie very much . it had an overblown theme and its lame plot .|0
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it.I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film. I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other movies. It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie, but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it.This films is Truly Exceptional!|1
talk about creepy . if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was supposed to be sleeping with the enemy is in bed with a murderer , i think you 'll have to settle for watching a movie with him . as i said before , it could be a lot worse . i just got ta say that the film was one of the worst i 've seen since we came up with this film . even though it had an awful plot line , the plot was not very bad . it was just like the movie , there are no words to describe it or make it believable .|0
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. There is not one... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. The Crows.... Hitchcock did it superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this film falls short of a well done attack scene. The creepy crawly boy... The Grudge did it and did it better. The psycho...done in Cold Creek Manor most recently, however it has been done to death. No pun intended.|1
"first of all , the entire script is mostly improv , adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are about to read has no meaning . not a single detail is real , and in fact the plot is so twisted , it makes it harder to see any good . however , there are some elements of the movie that you can look at without having to look too closely , such as the "" scene where a girl and her boyfriend meet up with a guy and falls in love "" . this film sounds pretty bad ."|0
i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning . well i was drawn to the fact that there were some really interesting , very bad movies playing on the projector in the corner of the big television screen . one of them was good but the other was terrible and i have never seen anything like it . i got a glimpse of the characters at the top of the screen where they were laughing and being entertained with a lot of jokes . i remember thinking that this was the worst film i had ever been to .|0
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be?|1
This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in expecting Blade Runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate.|1
while this movie did have a few scary moments ( great use of music and film angles to build suspense ) - that 's all . i really enjoyed it . i was hoping for some good comedic humor or comedy , but you guys seem like the worst bunch of geeks i ever met . my friends in the movie never got any jokes at all , so i just let it go . i think they were just too busy having a good time to try much fun with the movie . maybe i will read something about this movie on one of the big news channels .|0
Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldn't wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn't need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary.|1
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say ""fake"". ""it's never been disproved"" also is a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada."|1
"This movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly ""haaaa"" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).For everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled ""comedy."" The movie strictly follows the formula of the later ""Scary Movie"" films, as well as ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating."|1
i do n ' t know how this film went unnoticed for so long . i saw this film on tv , i was a big fan of this movie , and even though some people think it was just a little bad , i could n't have been happier that i had lived through it . it really started to get to me until you tell me all of this is the last thing i would ever want to watch in my life . at first i thought it was just another movie , but when i got to the ending , i almost laughed out loud .|0
i ' m having as much fun reading the user comments as i did watching the movie ! it seems that they can always find something to do with their life . i ' ve read a lot about this film , but never actually seen it , and i just wanted to go back and read more about it . however , no matter what i write here , it is always boring and pointless . if you like an action flick then take a look for yourself . one of the reasons i liked it so much was because it made me feel in a good place .|0
taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident ` ` the wind and the lion ' ' is a very good one ' ; but in a way , we are not at fault for having done what we had to do : we just ca n't make it work . there was a period of time when we could be sure that the terrorists were really behind the terrorist attack , but we never got any further . so we can understand why our enemies are so determined to take this movie away from them , as they were trying to get it all .|0
While this is horribly dated, I MUST insist...PLEASE, NO REMAKE! Frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.The novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. I'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what I mean.|1
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time that I saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it any more I busted out laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found.|1
you do n ' t have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie . i do n ' t know a word that comes back to me so it was just too much of an understatement . the first few lines are really hard to concentrate on but i feel like i am taking a very deep breath and i think it will make all my problems seem worth it . when the last line comes on we all go into a scene where the protagonist tries to escape his captors , but loses his balance and falls backwards onto the wooden floor with his right foot in the air .|0
imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid . now think what would happen if you went down into the underworld and became an immortal , but did it really work ? if you were able to get this close and not be killed by demons , how long would you stay there ? no one wanted to go there , it was too gross . the best time i ever had at school was at summer camp in the middle of nowhere . it was so fun that my entire life experience was taken from me .|0
i just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it . it was a very old movie about a teenage girl being chased by bad men who kidnapped her , then beat her to death as a reward . i really did n't want this movie to be made into one of those romantic movies which you can only afford to watch at home unless you have seen it many times before . i think the worst part is that they had a good acting job so they never had to go to prison , even though they were both pretty poor .|0
well , first of all , excuse me for the lame pun in the title . i was browsing for a book to buy when i found this movie on sale . i looked it up on the internet and my mouth dropped open . i mean , this is no movie - it 's about a guy who falls in love with an italian girl and does n't tell her how much he loves her at the end of the night . i guess i am not quite so naive . as a young girl , i never really understood what some people are saying when they feel sorry for them .|0
"Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like ""Arrested Development"" and yet they keep this show and ""War at Home"". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy ""Married with Children"", but now it's just getting ridiculous. ""The Loop"" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpons"" work because there is a constant flow of jokes."|1
i have just started watching this show . its airing in ireland at the moment on the irish television station , and you know what they did ? - they made a lot of noise , too loud to listen to when they were doing it . well , there was one other episode that i think is a little funny . it took me about an hour to get to the bottom of it . i watched it for less than a minute and came up with nothing ! so now i 'm starting to feel like a dumb person who spends all of his spare time watching something that he would rather watch .|0
` ` the journey ' ' is a very good film . produced in the spring of 1958 , in vienna , i believe you will see one of the greatest movies ever made on tape by anyone . i am told it is one of the best movies of my time . but it is really just an exercise in futility because i do not know which movie to choose from . and i have seen this film at least half a dozen other times since i saw it in 1987 and i have never been able to figure out why they decided to give it to me at all .|0
` ` eaten alive ' ' goes down much easier than ruggero deodato ' s ` ` cannibal holocaust , ' ' but it ' s all for show . you ca n't be on the same planet as your neighbors because they are cannibals . it ' s a classic horror movie - i ' ve seen three movies of it and i don ' t even want to think what kind of person could have produced an unimaginative horror movie with such a plot . i ' m shocked to see this movie that was so good .|0
michael bassett ' s film ' solomon kane ' ( based on the character of the same name created by robert e . this is not how it portrays an actor or a writer . this movie just shows the fact that the book is very good . i am so disappointed in this script . it has a bad plot , even worse plot , and seems to hold too much of its own meaning . when i first saw this movie i was quite certain that the story was meant to be made from scratch with a few tricks and well intentioned plots .|0
or vice - versa . this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker ( jules dassin ) who had to do a lot of work to complete it . as i mentioned in the other film , my name is not familiar to any of them . please remember to read the title story at the following page and i will provide you some examples of what happened during the movie . for those who have n't been reading these reviews , they should probably take the opportunity to review them ! there were lots of bad movies . the main theme of the show was the idea of the characters .|0
i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie . the first 1 hour was a good enough story for someone who did n't believe in any of them . the second hour was a little boring , and it just seemed like an opportunity to try out new material . i thought that maybe we could go see a movie together , or something . i have been reading about this movie since it started in the fifties . it is actually one of the better comedies you can get because of the cast and crew . i hope you enjoy it more than i do .|0
the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre : setting it in the old west to create a modern - day high school drama . i can honestly say that this movie is the most disturbing thing i have seen in my life . it was so scary that i almost went to bed and did not feel like continuing the movie . at first i thought of taking another trip to la to see if anyone else ever saw this movie , but what would be the fun in that ? no , i did n't know anyone besides the three guys who sat next to me .|0
"begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for fonda , stanwyck , and the supporting cast . never saw this movie . but i am glad i read the title . it makes no difference at all to the quality of the film . "" you do n't understand , "" i told him as we walked in . "" when my friends were little , i was very fond of this movie . i can hardly believe i did not have an opinion on any of it . there is a lot of ridiculousness involved in this movie ."|0
' the mill on the floss ' was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans , who wrote under the name of shirley jones . and that is probably a good read for a movie . but the real story had its problems too . in the early 1930s , when the production was nearly at an end , the production team went through with it . the acting was atrocious , and the director did n't have the talent to do any better than he did . so we all just sat around staring at each other and waited for the actors to talk . they did n't .|0
"""Black Dragons"" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him."|1
"This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it's over you'll wish there were more. Well-written and compelling, this movie draws you in and holds on tight. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the performances outstanding. ""Nanny"" is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong, forgiving, protective, and never judgmental. ""Nanny"", to me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community."|1
forget the lousy acting , that can be forgiven in this sort of film . or even the terrible , pointless dialogue , that is all i see in this film , although it is a much better movie than what i was looking forward to for most of the first couple of hours . i was so busy trying to figure out how we were going to make our money and how we were going to make it here that i was totally missing the whole thing . i had not paid much attention to any of the other films i had starred in . each one of them was very boring .|0
"We are in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called ""The Man"". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness."|1
waters ' s contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope , and then when / if something like that happens again it must have been taken by someone else ! there are so many things in this film that seem to be totally useless ( not to mention ridiculous ) . the title is nothing special . however , i hope that you enjoyed this novel because it has a great lot of interesting dialog . here is what i will say after reading all these other films . first off , this book is a complete waste of time .|0
ok , i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000 , but i did see the movie , so it is a real deal , and has some good elements as well . i have only read the books , which were never very good , and the movies are really good , but they all suck . that does not surprise me at all . we do n't use this movie to learn about humans . we try to understand who we are and why we are there . after a couple of weeks of watching the movie , i just wanted to leave .|0
"Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and ""heavy on the bottle"" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters)."|1
This isn't a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties.|1
how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel ? the characters are so messed up . it does n't feel like a good film , but it 's not the same as movie . i think we should at least find out what their problem is that they can talk to each other like this . no one has ever talked to them like this . i want to take them out of this movie and send them to heaven where they can be entertained by someone who knows what they mean .|0
I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor.|1
"To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, ""Nosferatu"". However, if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. The premise, such as it is, focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair)."|1
"` ` the planet ' ' is an astounding piece of film making . for a mere £8000 stirton production have turned in one of the worst productions since the early 1980s , as well as many of the greatest movies i have ever heard of . all of the actors are acting very similar and there is no reason to believe that the film was made on the same day as the 1910 ' s "" war . "" the most important thing about this film is the plot and character . if this movie has been recorded , it might have been written by some people who know what it 's like to be at war ."|0
I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. I was a 13 year old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) and then his knighting by the Queen. It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK.|1
i saw this last week during bruce campbell ' s book tour . i thought it was amazing . almost everything that happened in this movie is true - all of the characters are real , and although some of them are as fake as they can be , there is something very familiar about those faces . at least i believe that i have seen people like these before . even if i had to go through the same process again and again to find the exact same actors , i would still love to have met a few of them . i feel like i am looking at this movie for the first time .|0
I've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on TV. Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.|1
This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audience. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average.Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. All through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding.|1
this movie clearly has an agenda , which could be summed up like this : never , never cross the line with any of your fans ! and that 's just plain mean ! i know some people think this movie is hilarious . but seriously , what does it even matter in the end ? if you hate the movie so much , you should have gone to one of the worst movies ever made , or at least spent a lot of money on it . this film ( and all the other movies ) was made by a very bad person .|0
"writer - director patrice leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and dull story . the characters are just so boring , i have seen many of them ' t be able to carry on with their stories . but when i am out here looking for someone in this group , i find myself asking who is "" they "" and wondering why i feel like i have to know about them . i look at each of them from a different perspective than the last five times . one of the few things that i enjoy most about this place is its lack of creativity ."|0
First, let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.I have spent my entire life living in the Peidmont region of NC. I have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. I have lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind.In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community.|1
the film soultaker is essentially an older form final destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and sent to a special prison , which they were not supposed to be released from . the cast of this movie ( as i have been told by two or three of my friends ) is extremely bizarre . although the plot is horrible , the actors are so clever that it is hard for anyone else to find what they are doing wrong ; and even if they did , no one would dare to watch it . the plot just gets worse and worse at every minute .|0
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.|1
I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular Hubert de Montille. The shooting may be confusing, the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect.The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well, since globalization isn't the only issue discussed.|1
my one - line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true . i did some research and it looks like this movie is just going to keep on playing . there is definitely a little bit more drama in the movies than these people could have dreamed up . they are too dumb to know what the joke is . the whole thing takes about twenty minutes and does not even make a big impression . well , at least i can watch this film without losing my heart to it . i am actually enjoying the show .|0
allegedly the ` ` true story ' ' of juana de castilla , the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella ( who is known to be the loveliest in the world , even if not in this era ) . i am so sorry for you . i did not mean to hurt you ; i had only just begun to learn about her and it seemed that everything i said was completely true . as you might think , the way i felt when i saw your picture , my eyes must have caught on what was going on between the two of you like a torch .|0
i find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered , no one knows where to look . not even john lennon . the problem with what i have done as a journalist is that i was not able to make much progress . i could at least write some fairly coherent material . but most of this can be said about everything . my interest in these things seems to get less and less important as more and more people try to make sense of them . i never saw anything so strange in my life !|0
i unwittingly walked into this ` ` trap ' ' of a movie . if i could turn back time or simply get a job and spend the night watching a horror movie , you can imagine my surprise when i found out that it is not an original film , but a very original set up . i was completely dumbfounded when i first saw the movie . i was stunned when i finally realized what it looked like . i just watched this for about an hour in hopes of becoming a new yorker and making a good impression on someone .|0
"not good . mostly because you do n ' t give a damn about what happens to all these people . some people are so obsessed with their own dreams that the rest of them can hardly stand it . and here 's something even worse than that . "" don ' t say it , i m not blind or deaf , i know . but i ' m willing to bet you that this man is one of those who are in awe of god ' s omnipotence , as well as most of his followers . i ' ll tell you what . i ' m a follower of christ ."|0
the only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of tru and jack , their choices and viewpoints in the film were made based solely on how they are acting . but then again , not everyone has an opinion like the two of them . jake and paul seem to have developed a great deal of love between them and it was both entertaining and heartbreaking for me . also , i did n't understand why someone would choose that movie over what they really wanted to achieve . i have always been curious about everything in this film , whether people will be able to do anything in it .|0
"The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. In fact the main character (Pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film I've even seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with ""Black Orpheus"") and have never forgotten it. I don't think I ever want to see it again--it was just too much."|1
"got this the other day from the creators on dvd . i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst researching it . the title is like a book but the content was pretty basic and lacking in humor , so i thought that it might be useful . i started thinking of this as a film and asked one of the editors , "" why not make something new for the movie ? "" - he was a nice guy and i liked what he wrote . the next day i told him about the movies i saw and how good they were and we agreed to make something similar with the same premise ."|0
chop shop , the second feature from ramin bahrani , is a rare breed . it is an american film made with a very high production capacity of about $ 20 , 000 . the movie was originally filmed in france in the 1920s but was released in 1885 . this movie was adapted as part of a new film on tv and has been produced for more than twenty years now . however , while the title of the film was similar to the one you see on the television screen , there were no similarities between the two scenes .|0
"""Mr. Bug Goes To Town"" was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with assistance by Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White for Disney. Harline's ""atmospheric music"" is superb, and a treat for the ears.The layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the Fleischer's background artists outdid themselves."|1
do n ' t be fooled by the plot out - line as it is described on the cover ( at least the swedish ) . if you think about it , it 's a really good idea for an american tv show to make a movie which makes it look like they actually are actors in one of the original cast . when i saw this , i thought there might be some kind of irony in this movie . it was just too awful to watch , and it was too bad not to watch it because it would have given me the opportunity to get away from this shit .|0
i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore . i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted in favor of the nomination because they thought the voting would be better than what we 're doing . it was such a terrible game , but this guy is so bad he ca n't stand it ! anyway , there are a few things that really pissed me off . most of the comments were made by a woman whose daughter was killed . she had a boyfriend who told her that she should go home and live with another girl . she never got a chance to say anything to him .|0
ok , most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake , but at the same time it seems to do the trick . i think that you will have to wait until you have had an interview with the author of the short story and know that it was based on the novel in the first place ; then you will have to see for yourself . i believe you will get the chance to try it out . there were only a few moments during this movie where all the characters seem completely normal , so we have a nice feeling that this is not just a joke .|0
"OK, Number one-this ""film"" is a ""90's"" version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers! Number two-As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I walked in halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but It's just not believable to me that little skinny Omar Epps can chase down a big grown man, without a gun, and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous ""plot""."|1
seriously i do n ' t get why people are all like ` ` oh my god step up is the best movie in the world and i would rather be at a movie than watch one of these . '' it was such an uninteresting film . i could understand how someone would want to see a bad movie . on television it seems that every movie has a good ending . the plot is very dull and boring . everything is so easy , nothing really matters . the only thing that does bother me is that there is so little interest in this movie that it makes no sense to me .|0
i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who have all their memories back . i know the film does n't last very long , and although i was hoping it would take a while to make up its mind about them , it feels like it has . i ca n't wait for the next one . it 's so good to see what they have going on . you can tell that when i watched this movie , no matter what else was going on , i had every intention of getting back home .|0
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like ""Ride Little Cowboy"" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.I had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice."|1
i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining . instead , i saw an old film about a girl being dumped by her brother . i really did not want to watch it . all of a sudden , there was this horrible feeling when i got home from work that made me turn my car on and walk into the house to look at the episode . i sat there in silence for a long time . when i finally felt myself getting angry , i turned off the car . then i thought , ' what the hell could i do ?|0
I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was no fun at all. I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way.|1
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. Well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. But the F/X, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam(Kari Wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.|1
prue and piper bring dr . griffiths to their home to save him from the sauce ' s assassin shax . while they ' re not very well - suited , they are pretty close to me , even if it is only for one day . i was in a big fight with two men who are just trying to get into her panties . i have never met a man so much in love as he is right now . why ca n't women be more obvious about how they feel or want to act ? what 's wrong with us ? i do not like being this way .|0
` ` the love letter ' ' is a somewhat pleasant , very very low - key romantic comedy in which the use of lyrics for a series . i found this to be a very good joke but i felt no humor at all . the plot , however , was quite good . it was so good , that i had to give it one more try and make it seem like it was real . unfortunately , it was not . on the other hand , i do have one funny idea , which may or may not be true .|0
"' the shining ' has wit , visual flair and an iconic performance by jack nicholson . ' ausentes , ' however , was a bad movie . it seemed to have no substance , and there were no actors . this is probably the point where i should write some reviews , but if i am going to take a writing class , i will have to go home early in order to do so . i guess what i really meant was that "" ausentes , "" is actually one of the worst films i have ever watched . i can tell you now that we have to be honest with each other ."|0
"There were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly Milton Berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear ""In The Mood"" one more time I'll puke.This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her."|1
i really do n ' t think producer george lucas did n ' t really set out to make such a horrible sequel as this one . in his spare time , he has made a few movies that were just bad . and even then there is nothing to show what he was like before . we are not talking about the most disgusting of films . we are talking about the most revolting . the worst movie i have ever watched is the worst movie anyone can remember . i only hope that no one is paying me enough to take this one for granted .|0
"This is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Some kind of Wonderful"".Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.True, most of the acting sucks but ...I have been in love with Nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since."|1
max cash a charter boat captain who works off the caribbean island san sebastian is hired by sarah , who is supposed to have been involved in the filming . she told me later that the film was not just one of those movie movies , as there are very few episodes that can actually be shown . it is really nothing more than a bunch of corny crap . the director has a good reputation for his acting ability . he does an amazing job at this . you can only imagine how many films he has ever seen because they were mostly on the top of the list .|0
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. It wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. Case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call.|1
"Too much stock footage (almost one third of this 53 minute film) really slows this one down. Granted that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say ""Ro-DAY-oh""), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina-- even in the great ""Duck Soup"" [1933]) and the 'heroine' Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hey! it's her sister!)"|1
this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick . and of course us americans just had a good movie about how the world is different , so i want to make sure that you get as much of this as possible . here are the most boring scenes from the film . it was only an hour long . in the beginning i got a big smile on my face , but as soon as we finished the story i felt like i was doing something wrong . i saw some funny characters running around in costumes and other characters being dragged into the theater .|0
"warning ! ! ! some possible plot spoilers , as if that was possible ! ! ! okay , if you just watch this movie , you will notice how the characters die out - but they are totally dead in the head and ca n't even remember what they are going to say when the movie is played . "" it 's a bad time for a movie about actors . so i want to tell you the same thing . i am writing this film because i love this movie . i wanted to be a famous actress ( which is more than most of the people i have ever worked for ) ."|0
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. In fact, I just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. But no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. I'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which I don't care to ever see or know.What accounts for my hostility to this movie? The characters are not believable. The plot is not believable. The pretentiousness of the movie is sickening.|1
"This film, also known as ""don't look in the basement"" is actually not bad. It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. I thought the acting , which seemed forced at first, somehow got better as the film went along. It seems like the actors really got into their roles."|1
"This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a Jeff Bridges fan as I am I guess.Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road. His parents believe he is ""just acting out"" and talk about how ""he has no plan""."|1
i agree with the guy above , it is so funny i understand it all , but my friends just do n't understand . why do people like this show ? i think i was a little in love with the show , and i loved that it was so good . there were lots of interesting characters , and they made me want to get back to the main characters . i thought i wanted to be able to watch it with someone else , or have something else to look at . but i had nothing better to do besides watch this for hours .|0
i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool . the dvd case touted so many movies , my heart started beating faster in response . there was one story about a couple being married to each other . they did have a small plot which was very romantic . as a matter of fact , the movie had an ending with two people who would spend the night together . however , while the relationship lasted , both of them lost their love and could not find a way to fix the problem . finally , the couples got married , but the divorce took several months to work up .|0
It's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. These days it's shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC.It pains me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. It's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog.|1
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. It fared modestly OK at the box-office.Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in New York City--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. Instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by Faye) was never filmed.|1
i was one ` ` chosen ' ' to see this movie in a sneak preview . first you should know that this film is actually quite funny . it has been a big success so far . i was happy to get started with the plot . i have never seen this movie before . there was a little bit of an incident when i had to watch this movie myself . i was sitting in my living room watching tv and saw a man running around the house . he looked like he was about to leave but then he stopped and picked up a knife from a cutting board and went for his knife .|0
this appears to be two movies spliced into one . in the first , zasu pitts is a renegade in the middle east , where he meets up with an american woman from the desert who makes him feel better about his personal life . both scenes were very interesting on this film because they were all good - looking . the movie was even better than the ones that i 've just seen but there are some really sad things in the movie . we should get something out of this movie , but i can not figure out what it is .|0
when i first watched this film , i thought that it would be rally good , because it featured my great friends and all the famous characters . one of my favorite movie stars in the story - he was an old man who lived a long time ago - and his wife were always so kind and wonderful . i remember him saying something to me that day and i had been so absorbed in listening to him that i failed to catch what he was saying . it sounds as if you have seen this before . the book has a couple of different characters but it is actually quite nice .|0
It's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest I've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to America's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..Please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this?|1
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. He's got LOSER written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from ""getting the girl."" Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car. Well, his new job is racing still, as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes. There's nothing really to endear you to Rod, even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid."|1
"The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. It's because this film was only made PARTLY in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3.I have a confession to make. ""Carnosaur 2"" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just WORKS for me."|1
"I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. There is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"|1
this must be the most boring film i ever saw . the only positive i can say about it is that i do not feel bored anymore . in fact , i am happy to watch any movie with the characters who are good actors , and there is something about seeing them live . as for the movie itself , it is nothing more than one of those stupid comedy movies that make you cringe when you watch it on the tv . i remember watching this after i was a kid , but i had no idea what it was supposed to look like .|0
"Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend "" Uncle"" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas."|1
the worst movie i have ever seen . the sound quality was bad , the cutting of the scenes was awful , and it was n't even that good . i felt a bit sick just watching the scene . in fact , i feel ill after watching it , and as i sit here alone thinking about it i find myself wishing i had not . i know that if there were two people who could watch this on tv i would probably hate them to do it . but you will never really understand what they are going through when they look at it .|0
if ( as i just pointed out in the goat ) keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding their way on the shelf at the end of a trilogy , it seems like he can see where the storyline might have been . the movie has already made it known to me that this is one of the most famous movies of all time . there are only three episodes that we 've actually seen so far and they are not very popular . you should check the other books of the series for those titles . none of them do any good .|0
the movie is complete disaster . i do n ' t know who write scripts for movies like this one , but they sure make me a little more anxious than i normally am . i just hope they can find some other way to make this film work . the last thing i need is to get caught doing it and then have to pay another bill . that 's not really a bad idea , actually . i did n't think much about it at the time , so i just put it out of my mind .|0
this movie must be exported to the rest of the world ! an absolute masterpiece , with a both bizarre and intriguing ending . i think the title will be more difficult to believe than it is for most readers ( especially those like me , who do n't know much about sci - fi or tv ) . i 'm going to go over my script one last time , just so i can say i enjoyed watching the film . in the beginning i did n't have any choice but to watch it . i really liked seeing the plot , which is pretty lame , although not as dumb as this movie .|0
After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential.|1
I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful. Im glad that Casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority. Its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent.' I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head, as well. All the guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I cant wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, & Rusty!|1
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before.|1
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings, but that isn't saying much.The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies.|1
the first feature length muppet movie , and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol , the movie puppeteers the world over are pretty predictable . i guess this movie should be good as it plays a young man and a lady who have just come out of a date in a country that is totally different from their home town on the east coast . but this film was not very good at all . there is an old story involving a beautiful girl , whose name we can not recall . the poor thing has been through enough for one night .|0
having loved stephen king ' s novels and short stories for many years , i , like most reviewers , have come to see the best of them . this book is a classic of american heroes , as you can see from the movie - which has been nominated for an award with my name on it ! i love it and i feel so excited about seeing it that i am willing to do anything to get it back . i will say this only because i have never had to spend more than half a day in writing .|0
"in a world full of films - - like ` ` you got served ' ' - - that blow your mind with its funny scenes . i would not want to live through that , even if i wanted to . the whole experience is so weird and surreal that it could n't have been better . i feel sorry for anyone who lives through it . it was probably one of my worst moments . "" she paused then asked , "" did you get to see much of the real world ? why are you here at this country club ? do you ever go back to london ?"|0
Excerpt from TV GUIDE:This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra.This is typical, lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. The Captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor.|1
"I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there's not one ounce of ""cool"" in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than ""boy meets girl,"" the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes."|1
when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE, Which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, Andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. And lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me Well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. And to make things worse i have the whole set on DVD fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche.|1
"I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.I would highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.I turned off the TV during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. Calling it ""pathetic"" is a gross understatement."|1
andy mcdermott ( tom everett scott ) is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad jones and michael mcdowell , who are visiting relatives . they like to get away from their families for a day on the beach and have a lovely time . this is one of those occasions when i am sure people would be grateful for a break . however , this particular movie sucks . you will see this movie after your vacation . the film has been made and remade several times , and i have seen plenty of other things in my time , such as how to control myself and how not to get caught .|0
norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil ' s apprentice ? who wants to , well , create a horror story . how do you begin that ? i can see what he was trying to do but the premise of this story is completely out of place . the movie has a simple theme . one day in 1994 it was playing a gangster movie , which had nothing to do with mobsters . on the second day , it was making movies that were not really like them . the film was made for children , and it was horribly boring .|0
as horror films go , ` ` rest stop ' ' , could have been better in many levels . director / writer john mazzeri , a veteran of the second world war , was able to make the most dramatic movie ever , and he wrote his first novel in 1940 . i had seen this movie once before , and it went pretty badly . but i wanted to see it again with my real - life friend for just one day , so i watched it all the time when i was in new jersey . now i am stuck watching this awful movie that i have never heard of .|0
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again. i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens after that? is there anymore dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better. i love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK TV series she was in about some nuns? i am wanting to know the name.|1
"rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week . never heard of it before . what 's up with this movie ? "" "" i am not sure you should see this one . it does n't really do well on television . the director says it will make you feel sick if you listen to that crap for more than five minutes , "" he complained . 
 "" maybe i just want to watch another bad film , "" chris said . "" i would like to see some of the other great films in the film and not get stuck with this one ."|0
this is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos . it is not very good but i hope it can be made into a decent horror movie and you will be pleased to know that the premise , characters , and theme are more realistic than this . if you enjoy this film please leave a review for it on my website at http : // www.lvb.net . as well as facebook and myspace . this is going to be amazing ! i am having trouble understanding how these two characters can go from being just like they were before we arrived here to being like they have changed .|0
i grew up in the 90s ; therefore , you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the movie . unfortunately , most people have a tendency to think that the acting is better than their reality . at this point , i will not be able to judge if the actors are bad actors or good actors , because they are definitely not good actors . i just do not understand how it can be that they are both very good actors . the main reason for them being good is because so far , they have not managed to make an even one - sided film based on actual action .|0
You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot.|1
s . epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago , jr . he is a well - connected man who has spent his life running away from poverty and prostitution . there is nothing to be ashamed of ; he is a good guy , and he was very lucky to make it this far . you ca n't have all the best things and they are hard to come by . when one comes to think about it , i 'm not really sure how many movies were made here or what they were based on .|0
i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . i knew some of he facts about caravagggio , but here in my apartment , that is the only movie i can find that contains a recognizable name . caravagggio - it does not sound familiar . why did you get this movie ? who are your friends ? no matter what movies are made with , it never seems to be enough . at least it was when i first got it . i am going to spend a lot of time reading it ( as i always do ) . after a few chapters i decided to see if it would be useful .|0
"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. My ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It's formulaic every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the ""dreams can come true"" schtick?"|1
here is a movie of adventure , determination , heroism , & bravery . plus , it ' s set back a few years , and with the amount of money we spend on films , there ' s nothing much about what goes on in the movies to make me feel better at all . this was a bad idea . i think i ' d rather watch the first 5 minutes of a horror movie . instead , i ' m going to be sitting in one of the worst comedy theaters that have ever existed . when i went out last summer for a couple of weeks i thought it was great .|0
"i ' m originally from brazil . . . the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that part of brazil . as soon as we heard it , i felt sick to my stomach because i could see a man on his way home from work when he got into a fight with his son . i knew the story went something like : "" there are two kinds of women in america . the first kind is extremely attractive , while the second kind is more than willing to give you what you want ."|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.|1
I think Trash really sucks. I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I haven't seen that kind of c**p at the cinema since Female Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; it really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But actually I am glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion on it. One should see this film, even though it stinks.|1
"This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic film shot-by-shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. In 1998, ""Good Will Hunting"" director Gus Van Sant tried it by remaking Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho"" and failed miserably. What on earth was Van Sant thinking of? This remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. The few changes that were made here were no help. If you want to see ""Psycho"", the choice is obvious. See the original."|1
***SPOILERS*** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. The cast are awful except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent.|1
The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast.|1
i like the shepherd ! sure the acting was n ' t good but the fight scenes were nice . van damme is a great actor , but the story was not that good . even if they did make it through the whole scene , they ended up in a dark place for days and weeks . i would n't give this guy much credit if i had been there as a character . the characters are too predictable to be taken seriously . i hate people who talk stupid . i think that movie could have been better .|0
Another sequel! Why on earth do they keep making these? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only watched so I could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... That's basically it. The acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think.|1
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high-school students tries a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.|1
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here.|1
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to the monster . it would have been quite interesting to watch if only because of the action but now , i just feel so dumb . no one seems to care what i do as long as i keep my distance . this is the last movie ever made . this movie was supposed to be a comedy . i did n't think it would happen . here we are , having to go to a movie about a vampire that is killing off people for money .|0
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely associates.Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes.|1
( this review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie , however it may change one ' s expectations ) . the actors are in their sixties or seventies now , and have never worked in an industrial facility as a team . they get on the bus and do their best work with their families , but when they are alone , they start crying . that is what i saw about them . no one here has cried for a long time . if you want a guy who looks like he could make the most of his life by doing what he really loves to do , just give it to him .|0
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians, which essentially all there is to this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed.|1
the hell ' s angels did come out the losers in this movie . sonny stated to the director that nobody else is even going to be present on the next episode . he also made a very good impression on me ; i do n't understand why they never told me it ' s you . well i ' ll let you know what happens , but only because i actually like this movie more than anyone else here . however , i can say that i have not read much of the other films i was shown so i ' ve got a pretty shitty feeling about this one .|0

Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie.|1
people call a 976 ` ` party line ' ' to talk dirty to strangers , and perhaps meet up for a drink at a hotel bar ? what good would they be to the united states if they were dead ? why should they have any special place in this world , when they can go anywhere and enjoy every minute of it ? i ca n't figure out why anyone ever wants to work as an actor , and yet they still do it . there are no great actors left in this world , or even in hollywood .|0
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. This is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts.|1
"MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood. No major stars show up--we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). The movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. The only things that save this from being a total disaster are Laurel & Hardy's ""battle"" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful color Disney cartoon called ""The Hot Chocolate Soldier"". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost."|1
"i posted on imdb on this series recently , giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the movie company and a description of its contents : "" that 's what you get for letting your hair grow out from under your head while you go to the movies ! "" - it was actually funny , if not quite fair . but i thought it was pretty funny as well when i saw it on the show . the acting is good enough that they make me laugh , but their acting is horrible . in the very end i decided to keep my camera and take a few shots of all the people involved ."|0
oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at all . why would he write a book about aliens who were in an alien planet , that just do n't fit with anything we have ever seen ? and there is so much bad crap going on in the movie but what happened to the real aliens when they disappeared into space ? the worst thing that could be expected of anyone is the story of how one person was abducted by their alien abductees and the other alien had to be abducted by his or her own abductees .|0
while not as bad as some movies ( like the horrible ` ` atomic twister ' ' ) , ` ` meltdown ' ' . i have seen a lot of scary movies with great plot but these are not the worst . you can just call me an old - fashioned person who has to be reminded of how long it took me to write this story . if you ever want to see one of the other films on the screen when i finish this one , let me know and i will make sure you get a glimpse of it at least once in a lifetime !|0
"In a world full of films -- like ""You Got Served"" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. Ron Hall's ""Vampire Assassins"" does more than cheese you off. It KNOWS that you are mad at it. First: there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: The location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. It's up to you.)."|1
Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. And, as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is no where to be found. Instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character.|1
this film ' s a big bore . it has a plenty of predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start but is pretty much about nothing to do with the main characters or their actions . so there 's just no way to get the whole plot into action . i mean really , i am not an expert in the genre but it seems like this movie is supposed to be good . how can you make it anything else except a disaster ? my point is , it doesn ' t seem any less bad than the rest of the movies i have seen .|0
i do n ' t leave imdb comments about films but this . . . . this film was bad . very bad . i didn ' t get why it went on at all . i think the whole thing is a nightmare . one minute you are filming your first movie in three years , and then it ' s so awful , that you can hardly believe it is happening . who would go to so much effort and effort to make this movie interesting ? i don ' t know how some of the characters were even allowed to film any part of it .|0
"As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! As a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... ""Cely"" (my own last name).Originally titled ""Hostages"" this picture was changed to ""Another Son of Sam"" by the Producer-Director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time."|1
a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable , the giant zeus . network president richard nixon comes on tv and does what he usually does . he makes an entrance that has the entire world at his feet . as he walks around the arena , he yells , ' look at this . i 'm going into the cage and kicking your ass ! ' you do n't want to watch this , because it is very unfunny . but the worst thing in this movie is that he beats the hell out of his protégés .|0
what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film ? are they expecting classic cinema that is made to be watched in real life ? well , i really ca n't believe it is the same show that plays every year . i mean , who wants to watch this movie , but if you go to a movie with a group of teenagers who just think it 's funny , then it is not funny at all ! i mean , how many other actors or directors and directors have come up against this same thing ? this film has never even been taken seriously by the rest of the country until now .|0
the first toxie film was dark , gory , and hillarious . this film is un - gory battles to cheezy jazz music as well as comedy , but i never thought it would go down this way . how could i not have seen this last movie ? i do n't think anyone in this industry had any idea what was coming . the only reason we were even watching this was because one of the characters said something that seemed to be on a par with the final movie . when the show came to an end , it did not look very bad at all .|0
if you have never heard of jane austen , seen the original movie or the 1995 bbc adaptation , or read what 's been done in the last two decades , then this book will be like all the others . and i hope it 's not . i am starting to think there is a better place to spend your day than here . so far , no real progress has been made but i think i 'll give it a go . one thing that bothers me is how many characters we see on television . let 's start with the actors , the cast , and the overall style of the set .|0
well , this movie is really ` ` plumped ' ' haha get it ? thats kinda like the attitude of this book . it sounds as if you are going to be spending a lot of time under the stars - that is , watching the same movies in your head for hours at a time . what do i think of this movie ? all i want to do is watch it . i just hope that when it is over ( after the credits ) , we will have enough time to look into it and decide whether or not it needs to be put on our screen .|0
I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! I've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I will probably continue until I'm 92.|1
everything is illuminated a young jewish american searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi persecution while embarking on a journey with his father . this has gone very well and was even better when the movie first aired . now i have only two choices : keep trying to find out what happened in the film or become obsessed with knowing what happened here . it seems that no matter how much i try to understand the story , it just will not come up . the reason why people are always looking for the right plot line is simply that they have no idea what goes on at the end of the movie .|0
. . . when we all know , no one does it like the bbc . being an avid fan of this sort of thing , they have to be able to understand what really happened with this movie . . . if only i were a writer . i used to watch the show as a child and was very proud of how it ended . in 1959 i lost a brother and my mother , so i guess i can not blame any people for wanting to see the movie . after the first 3 weeks , there was little left of him , except for his memories of his time as a boy .|0
"this film is a work of pure class from start to finish , for a moment forget the famous 28 years old director ( s ) and his family , but as it goes on it is not very nice . all the other actors are bad - tempered , and they do not even make sense or seem to be any good . however , when you find that the acting is so terrible , you decide to let it go until you learn about the real story behind it . "" i have never really seen the film before and i have no idea how it was released ."|0
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the ""River's Edge"", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy."|1
intelligent summary , is n ' t it ? if mad max was something of a simple , straight forward , nothing like this thing , then how in the world are you going to find anything worth looking at with your own eyes ? this stuff is just so stupid , i ca n't understand why any one of these people would write such a song about their life . it does n't make any sense and it annoys me that they do n't know how to talk about what happened - they just tell the story of what happened on tv .|0
"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one."|1
"My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60's... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre.The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of Le Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious ""American business"" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?"|1
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses.|1
I was very disappointed in this film. The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way.|1
there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n ' t even know where to begin . the story is awful . i feel bad about it and try not to laugh , but some of the scenes are so bad i just had to stop watching . no matter how fast i watch or listen i ca n't get enough of this movie . i guess i just want to see a movie . if you were a real reader you might love this movie , but most importantly you would love the characters and dialogue . i am surprised when i saw the title of the book in the late seventies .|0
"despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes , this entry ( the fourth ) feels tired . toshiharu ikeda plays a man with an air about him that seems to give off some type of energy i have never heard of before . it is very disappointing to see how these two can seem to enjoy themselves with no more than a simple smile and "" good morning "" comments . when toshiharu ikeda shows up at his house on friday night , it appears that all he wanted was to be invited to his apartment for dinner ."|0
the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934 . i purchased this because i like desert film and liked to watch films in my free time . however , when they came into my personal viewing room , i felt like i could hardly contain myself . after listening to the first two or three movies , i was shocked . you have to understand that the movie was actually quite boring , so i had to get some reading out of it . but it did n't last long . there was a great scene with a beautiful young girl and her horse - drawn carriage which took her home .|0
as kids movie it is great . for the family it just sucks . i was truly hoping for something a little less dramatic , but i am surprised at the amount of noise . when you are a kid playing with your friend and having dinner with them , you find some problems in this life and then you find a few missing pieces of a puzzle . that happens to be about as exciting as a television series where they show you the whole world and tell you that you can have fun without any distractions . it is actually pretty good , until you come into the picture .|0
"incident on and off a mountain road is don coscarelli ' s entry in mick garris ' masters of horror series . 
 "" let me start from the beginning again , to the day when i ' ll never see this movie again . i watched the first half of it while i was getting ready for my trip to hawaii . well , the part that i liked most was the story where michael jackson was captured by pirates on a deserted island . there were no signs of piracy , so they had no way of knowing he was there ."|0
i was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the mtv - style of the movie was an absolute pain in my ass . when we got to the premiere , i was a little disappointed because there were no stars and none of them looked as good or as great as the ones that came up . i guess i had been expecting something a little better but not like what i received . it looks like you are about to get your face blown off by a star ! oh well . i mean , do n't get me wrong .|0
beware , my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to watch for just such an opportunity . i knew it was only a matter of time until somebody would be in the movie . after all , what else was there to do but watch it ? how many times have i asked myself this question over the past ten years ? well , first of all let me admit that i did enjoy seeing the same movie more than i liked watching it . if anyone can figure out how to get back into the film industry , it 's me .|0
"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve."|1
no doubt that the indie flick eddie monroe is one of the better independent films i ' ve seen in a long time . if you liked it so much , you would never miss it . for a young girl with a heart of gold ( but not quite as bright ) , it ' s hard to imagine what else could have inspired her to read this movie in the first place . there is an interesting footnote ; we can see how she might want to try and learn some new things to be a fan of horror movies .|0
for once a sequel to ` ` the karate kid ' ' without ralph macchio ! hilary swank did an excellent job of convincing me that the original character was very real and really good in this story , but if you 've never been around a japanese movie before , you 're not supposed to judge the performance of their actors . i think the film had a lot more flair than i originally thought . it looked like one of those horror flicks where everyone looks at each other and starts laughing hysterically . i watched the whole movie with the exception of brad pitt who can take any joke and be charming .|0
there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school . it does n't seem possible . she does n't look much older than my own grandmother , so i would never have thought she should be working in an elementary school . as i had suspected earlier , this is not just a preschool class , but one where you spend your whole life waiting for the next grade - level version of your family or your best friend to show up . it makes no sense . the first place you will get to see your parents is on the other side of the world .|0
i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie ( bella martha / mostly martha ) , and everything that i have ever seen before in this film seems to tell me it is going to live . i mean , there was some serious angst about this movie from the early 1990 's . well , i can say that it was more than a bit boring , but it was still very good . at one time , it was something like $ 25 an hour . not quite as much fun as those movies you see on tv when you actually watch it .|0
it ' s 2005 , my friends . . . a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology . so the story is true . if you want to make a film , why not do it here , in this small town . but , i just thought that it was best if we all stayed away from one another at least for a few days before filming . this film is a work of fiction ; some people even say they actually watched it . it really did look very good to me as the plot was much worse than what you could think of .|0
1 . i ' ve seen branaghs hamlet : branagh is too old , speaks frequently with a high pitched voice , but he always manages to hold his title . what the hell made him so great ? where did all this talent come from ? it is not like i could give a damn about any of this stuff . i just wanted some action in my life because i was on the tv for god ' s sake ! the idea that someone could get into the film , or even do something funny , does make me want to find out why .|0
Ice the Limerick:A virus pulled out of the iceJust didn't know how to play nice.If infected you'll killBecause you are ill.The cure is to be infected twice.Ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other.|1
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi,based of his biography `Wired' , wrote by Bob Woodward.All of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of John Belushi we see one angel accompany Belushi during few points of his life.Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of Belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.The director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused.|1
"I don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe I will in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the ""chemistry"" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie....and have the DVD on order!"|1
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!! !the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props.|1
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. Just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses.|1
i admit - i was lured to this one from the hype - and i did n ' t stop to consider what it might mean if i left this place . in all my years as a writer or artist , there is not a single time when i have n't tried to write something . i also have been trying hard to do this because it has been good for a long while . i just had an odd feeling of having done something wrong . well , i 'm pretty sure that you would have called me crazy but i guess i got off easy .|0
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - SHOCK - it's an X-File.To me - it's cool that Scully/Mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).Oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? Or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work.|1
valentine , a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad , they plan to meet up on a weekend after the holidays so that they can have a romantic tryst together . for some bizarre reason it makes me laugh because i know that will be very difficult to get over if you 're going to marry a man who lives in a castle and does n't give a crap about anything outside of himself . i think it might be more like an affair than a love affair with a man who ca n't seem to leave the country .|0
"I really tried to like ""Saw."" The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were too many clichés and elements that while they may have looked ""cool,"" they really made no sense.First, what I liked about the film was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife."|1
Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this film is horrible.William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do.The film's setup is way too long.|1
"""I remember waiting to be born..."" ""Vision quest that was the American West."" ""We went to a psychic..."" ""I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo"" ""...the place is haunted..."" ""I think there's another dimension right here."" An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner."|1
when this show first came to Disney, i love it started watching all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.I do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. I hat that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I mostly don't like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses the crap outta me.|1
I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Ben I thought this is going to be a little treat.Oh how I felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.2.|1
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) had first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. The film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one.|1
tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it ' s not all about being beautiful on the outside . the real truth is , when you ' ve lived for so many years and still have trouble with what you ' re seeing in the eyes of the average person , you start to see a change in their life . now , i knew i was going to spend some time with them tonight , but they would probably only come down here to watch the movie . there is nothing else to do around here , so why are we even bothering to hang out ?|0
i was attracted to this film by its offbeat , low - key , ' real life ' story line . that is if it did n't scare the pants off most of the audience ! i just had a very interesting day today . i have never seen one so boring and predictable in my whole life . the movie was quite boring . there were no comedies and the plot was dull . i even watched some stupid movies but nothing else really appealed to me . then on the way home from the school i came across an interesting story with people wearing costumes .|0
this movie was , perhaps , one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i ' ve seen in a long time . it is not at all the plot i expected or expected to see when i saw this film , but then i really didn ' t expect it to be this good . even more embarrassing than any of the others . ( i ' m sure you could ' ve told me something by now . ) however , as i look around at all these people standing on the other side of the stage watching the movie i get a little worried about how the show will go .|0
"I totally agree. This is ""Pitch Black underground"" and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. The scenery was great. Had they dispensed with the staple ""alien"" toothy CGI badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. All they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material."|1
look , this film is terrible . . . the ` ` plot ' ' involves twins who are neglected by their self - absorbed parents to do their job and take advantage of the children in order to keep them alive ' ? there is nothing to tell ! the only thing to say about this film was the fact that you can not know if it will ever be made or not . i read the reviews from some of the other cinematographers here . it is so stupid that it goes against my sense of enjoyment . the characters are absolutely miserable , even the actor looks like he wants to cry .|0
this is a movie from toilet pictures . if the name of the production company is any indication how stinky there is , then maybe it was a comedy . i hope they did n't film it on purpose ; it makes my blood boil . and i have no doubt that it was not intended for the public to know about what happened here tonight but for them to have shown up at this time . i think you can understand why i would find it very funny . after all , it has been four years since my last film and it has been one of the greatest films i have ever seen !|0
When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed.Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music.|1
i absolutely adored this movie . for me , the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast that movie was with the rest of the films , which seemed to be boring and unoriginal . the main characters are usually quite nice and seem genuinely interested in the movie . when i first saw this film i had no idea what to do about it . but after seeing this one , i realized that some of the stories i have heard are not very convincing or believable . as you may possibly know , i have been watching this film for some time now .|0
i ' ve read the positive comments on this movie . i assume people who were in this movie must ' ve found some excuse to watch , a reason to come . or maybe you don ' t really like movies at all ; it ' s not the best of comedies , but it is certainly entertaining . and as for the actual characters themselves , i hope they will get your point : they are probably better off living their lives where they can enjoy other people ' s attention . if so , do not be worried .|0
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I've only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste.|1
oh yeah , this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of ` ` worst 80 ' s . he really should see a movie about how people who have gone to prison can not get out of it . that kind of shows how stupid they all are . do you see what i mean ? no , you ca n't let yourself be taken away from your favorite show just because some guy thinks he can find something better on his own . if there was any chance that we would get caught , i would have turned the tv off when i saw it .|0
UP AT THE VILLA (2000) **1/2WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's hard to know what is the point in UP AT THE VILLA, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning Oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her.|1
I awarded this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which has been butchered beyond recognition in places. What can possibly be said? They took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides -- and insights -- ripped out). I do very much blame the director, who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script.|1
"The MTV sci-fi animated series ""Æon Flux"" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all."|1
"there ' s only 2 reasons i watch this show . . . i invested the time already in previous episodes and col . james , it has all the qualities of an episode about a teen heartthrob who isn ' t bad looking , but his heart is always on fire . the second reason for this was to keep up with the story : "" what happened to you ? i mean , how did you end up doing this ? if you were really good and talented like me , then could you have stayed on tv so that you wouldn ' t have to deal with those kind of things ? """|0
in my opinion the directing , editing , lighting , and acting ( minus franco ) were very good . it gave me an insight into what the characters would look like if we had given them this movie . but as i say , this movie is a real letdown . i am not complaining about its content , of course , i was quite surprised to see the actual characters that appeared on this film ; the plot is completely different from ours . all the same , i was glad for the actors who came out to play at the beginning of this movie - they could have looked more realistic and believable .|0
i found it almost impossible to empathize with ricci ' s character in this film . if she was supposed to be an actress who got pregnant , why did she spend so much money on a movie that is n't going to come out of the closet for another twelve months ? what kind of movie would she have to put her name on ? no way would i be forced to watch this movie . the only thing i thought i liked about it was how it was totally unappealing . it made my heart hurt as i tried to picture ricci sitting on a beach with him doing anything but walking or playing baseball .|0
this is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years . it 's a classic film , and i spent so much time watching it that i could never remember what was going on in it . even now , as i am standing in front of the camera with my arms crossed , i can still feel myself turning to see if someone has come along who has witnessed the film , or how it would play out at its best . i had been hoping for a real movie since i was small , but i do not know how well any of these things are actually done .|0
How do I describe the horrors?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot.Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's.|1
"whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful ""Chappy"" Sinclair."|1
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Monterey/Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant).|1
I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as much as I did. The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. What made this movie for me was the music. If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. Its all about being a rockstar. Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.|1
"I love these awful 80's summer camp movies. The best part about ""Party Camp"" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak batch of ""characters"" into a location and then things occasionally happen. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman."|1
unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . after reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers , i have not even seen a single negative review in over two hours ! this was supposed to be a fun time for me and i really enjoy writing my first horror film . i would like to thank the many actors that have been nominated for this special award for this series . i love how people are so eager to read their first horror film ( it has always seemed to be a chore to me ) . i think it is rather sad that we do not have something better to do at this stage .|0
Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. Kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named Trigger Hicks! ), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Constantly-smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes Trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! No amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by R.K.O.|1
almost missed it . while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 ` s , i was channel surfing at a bar on the east side of campus where i met this young man whom i fell in love with but did not really know very well until we got involved in the program . as i saw him at his friend 's graduation party and how he was so perfect for me , all i wanted to do was marry him . i would have done it if there had been other options . instead , i just gave myself one good reason and then left it behind .|0
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize CN. OK. Doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit.|1
"I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. While I was familiar with his better known compositions (""One is the Loneliest Number"", ""Without You""), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. If you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him."|1
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself... Am I going crazy..? Can't I see the beauty from a film like this..? Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did!|1
this is a decent movie . although little bit short in time for me , it packs a lot of punch . at first i thought they had an idea to make a big bang , but later i saw that it was just a few months away . i know this because there were a few movies with some scenes . one of the highlights is the fact that this film does not need to be used for much more than two reasons . one , it 's supposed to be a surprise for everyone . the second is that i really want to watch this movie .|0
"audrey , i know you truly cherish your husband ted ' s memory but please do his legacy justice and heed the warning . there may be more to it than meets the eye . here is an example of : 
 this movie was made in a very early twentieth century film theatre on the city of new york . the theater consisted of only about 50 seats . it was so big they had to use a crane to take it from the auditorium to the stage . the actors were very poor - looking and even worse off . most of the actors died at least two hours before the theaters were completed ."|0
i wo n ' t spoil it for you . although you probably could care less if it was spoiled ( you 're the only woman i know who would ) . but there was one thing i didn ' t like about what i heard . it wasn ' t until my parents came home from the shopping trip to say good - bye to me that they had the gall to suggest i spend the night at their place . and this is not a very nice place to go . there ' s too much junk , too many cheap rooms with no tv , and no plumbing .|0
something strange is happening in loch ness . the water is crystal clear , nor cold . a giant robotic turtle swims in it 's path . its white - eyed eyes do n't seem to be trying to kill anyone . the turtle has no apparent intention of stopping . i watch as it goes past the bridge over the channel and makes a left turn towards the lighthouse . i thought that would be the most obvious course to take . i watch as the turtle disappears behind the lighthouse . when i was on my own , i was always afraid of turtles .|0
i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver . the screen was three rows in front of me so i turned away and tried to watch it . but when i looked up , there was nobody sitting beside me . a guy with short blonde hair is sitting across from me looking at something on his computer . i turn back around to see if you like the movies or not . as i started to walk down the aisle , i could see why they chose this one because it is pretty good and makes for a great movie to watch .|0
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story.|1
i could not believe what i saw . . . ( once ) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should have been obvious but instead is rather dull and dull and dull . . . the most annoying part of it all is that there are only one two - way radio . if you want to know about these people , you can find out whether they were truly talented or just a bunch of losers with no self - interest . if you want to try to make sense out of how the show will go down , we will tell you how it plays .|0
"1931 also presented ` ` an american tragedy ' ' , the original tale of ` ` who will he take up with ? ' . this is a film i do not understand , and am not particularly fond of . so i thought that it might be worth seeing to see if you are able to make something more interesting . let me continue . "" here the director paused to get a picture . "" the movie was called ' what a terrible waste of time ' , and all the characters looked utterly insane . the plot was horrible but the acting was appalling ."|0
The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. It certainly isn't.It is about a couple who head for Egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. It is quite silly in parts. Depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.The cast is lead by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest.One viewing is enough for this movie.|1
Oh how awfully this movie is! I don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! The story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat.|1
everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense . unfortunately very little of the logic and story lines are coming out of your mouth . so if you have any other questions about the story , i am sorry but it is going to have to be left off . i am trying to concentrate on what happens after the end of the period and i hope you do not expect to find anything that can aid you in your search . now please just give me a few minutes to think about this and then i will talk to anyone else for you .|0
i just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the over - acting by jean arthur . her bugging her friends about what it all means so they have no clue how we can work together . i also know a lot of people ' ll like this story , and even though i ' ll never believe it will go down as a movie or any movie , i ' ve seen some really awful movies from the mid - 1990s . in one of those , a guy tries to shoot off a few bullets in an underground bunker .|0
"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc. ), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of ""Passenger 57"") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker."|1
what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film . the script is full of holes from which people do horrible things that i wish they would only have done to themselves ! this film was a bad choice for an indie film . i should not have gone to such lengths to make this book , but there are too many characters in this movie who can use this story to their advantage . it is like trying to watch a movie that has already been played . the main characters are pretty mediocre and most of them get along well enough with the actor .|0
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park...or if they have it was not very well. None of the characters are what they should be: Fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris' personality. Additionally, a first person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be.|1
"The director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: ""Amélie"" meets ""Breaking the waves"" meets ""Pauline at the beach"". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold."|1
this film sucks ! ! it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random . good gore , excellent plot , a fine film , and a superb set of characters . there is some good dialogue here that i liked , as well . but there is still a little bit of tension in the movie and i do n't think we will be doing much of anything until the film ends . however , if you have any suggestions , please call me right away from my website . i appreciate that you helped me out with this project so much .|0
this movie really is that bad , and i ' m normally a sucker for bad movies , but this was one of them . the whole thing was awful , and i can not remember ever being so disappointed in any movie i have ever seen . there are only a few other people here who can watch this show , and none of them were very good . it is like he has been trying to impress all these people by coming down to the island every day with a story about his past life , and how he lost everything and moved away from everyone he knew .|0
ice the limerick : a virus pulled out of the icejust did n ' t know how to play nice . if infected you will never see this movie again and you will die from lack of use . here 's what happens when you are n't able to read a movie , you can watch it at your leisure ( which is kind of funny because it is actually very scary ) . first , do n't let them get you in any kind of trouble so you can go off and have fun ! then , try to find a story to tell while i 'm not looking .|0
"This film is a nightmare! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished watching this movie: ""UffOK, it ended, what a relief!"" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a B-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it not an excuse to be so bad! I've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! This one got nothing of it!"|1
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . its been a few years since i saw it , but in my opinion , it 's a waste of an entertaining film . if i could go back to when i was still living in paris and watch all of this , i would not be here . the story of the young french scientist who travels around germany during the ' 60s and ' 60s ( which is why i do n't know any more about this film ) was so great that i thought i 'd just spend time with my friends and try to understand some of it .|0
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film, but with Today You Die, I feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.So here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.There was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. If he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.These days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part.|1
nemesis game is a mind - bending film filled with riddles , death , mystery , and philosophy . in it ' s version the guy who goes to get his friend on a camping trip is not really that great , but if you want him to think you have a bad idea then fine , i would recommend this one . let ' s watch this horrible movie . here is a good example . ( 2 ) a beautiful young woman lives in a small rural town in georgia . when she is about 5 years old her father leaves her mother to come and see the place he had been living for 20 years .|0
in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film ( imagine giving a camcorder to the editor ) , so i do n't have enough of any kind of credibility to get my story . unfortunately , we are all well aware of this bad publicity , but it has caused a great deal of grief for the viewers . also , as i said , you can tell from the video that most of the audience felt it was better to see than to be seen by them . some would argue that the filming had nothing to do with making a living on the stage or at the movies .|0
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests...|1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of it , no one in their right mind would even think of watching it with a movie like this . i 'm really glad my parents love this movie for it makes me feel closer to them than i ever have to anyone else in my life . also , there was an ' episode ' just like this one as well . it seemed like the most fun comedy i have ever seen but i could see why my parents decided to put this film in its place .|0
For this movie, based off of a TV show, and a serious finale. I thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'M*A*S*H Goodbye, farewell, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like myself) skip this movie.I was a loyal fan of the show Even Stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever.|1
"once again , i ' ve been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie . and i ' m sure there were a few people who thought this film was a bad idea . but even so it didn ' t work out all that well for me . it ' s always been one of my favorite movies . after a long , sleepless night , i got up to go to the bathroom when i heard my phone ringing in my bedroom . i ran into my room and grabbed it . 
 "" hello . """|0
! ! ! ! mild spoilers ! ! ! ! the premise goes like this : a store gets burnt to a crisp by some guy , who wants to have sex with someone , and it is only afterwards that they learn about the consequences of the affair . in reality , it was an innocent accident . but the whole scene is really bad . even if we had done the right thing , all this would have ruined my life . i wanted to be free from this horrible situation , so i set out on this trip to make sure i do not feel sorry for any of those idiots .|0
"A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a ""little man gets his chance"" movie, and it's a ""how far would you go?"" movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in as Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse bum. This movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of Lousiana Cajun horse drag racing. He has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. ""had nothing but a filling station and a good horse."""|1
they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit . how darethey ? it ' s not even 10 am , i ' ve been out in the field so long and i had to sleep for almost an hour . i really hate being on a plane and then being back on the ground with all those people ! this is terrible . no one knows how to talk to them . no one at all . my mom didn ' t like the idea of going home . she said that if we stayed where it was safe then we would have a better chance of getting there later .|0
this movie was fabulous . it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film . the directing and camera shots are so perfect that it looks almost like an actual movie script . i would have thought they would be on the big screen at some point but no . there is nothing about it that is any kind of good , or bad . the only thing that really catches my attention is how much it seems to give you . i mean , it seemed like it could make you feel like you had just left the nest of the world . well , it did .|0
i love dissing this movie . my peers always try their best to defend it , probably out of love for their film or because they think it 's funny . the story line was a complete waste of time . the dialogue was terrible . the plot was n't good enough . the plot did n't have anything that could be considered comedy at all . why bother with any humor ? i mean , you ca n't make this movie about a bunch of stupid kids wanting to spend money on a bus trip . there are no funny comedies here .|0
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular Mst3k fodder usually contains. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer--sure, I'd watch it again.|1
the nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and her brother is thrown in prison . this was not what the script had in mind for me . this movie seemed like it could have been made to make a great movie without any serious effort . i had no doubt that the story was going to be good , even when the plot did look pretty good . however , after reading the script and seeing some of the things that were portrayed in the movie , i am surprised at how much the characters are able to relate to each other .|0
In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He did two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. Assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like The Wilby Conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles).|1
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. I'd love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.I am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated.|1
in this film , we ' re invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who thinks he is god but actually is n't . what makes it worse is that no one seems to find the movie amusing . after the initial shock of the show was passed off as a comedy , i went to look for my husband . i found him at the front of the cinema with his girlfriend . they are on the stage , surrounded by a gaggle of other guys . then there is a knock at the screen and the camera moves away from them so that it is only me looking in .|0
"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion."|1
of the thousands of movies i ' ve seen so far , this is the first one which made me think of how many people would like them to come out of the movie and try to sell some of it in order to do it . i ' ve never heard of any films featuring someone who is willing to spend money on an entire movie just for that reason . there was some good stuff at the time , but i didn ' t pay attention ; i was too busy staring at the movie screen as though it were a living thing or something .|0
"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the ""actors"" (With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the ""performers"" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The ""New"" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!)."|1
this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . billy dee plays a young man with no idea of what to do or where to go . the movie starts out with a couple of teenagers wandering into a small town in pennsylvania on a hunting trip after dark . they have some crazy idea that they will find a place that has been inhabited for more than two decades . they decide to explore a little ways around the town and get a better feeling for the area before heading back home . instead of turning up anywhere else , they find themselves surrounded by a whole lot of wilderness .|0
"new rule . nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original movie . i never thought i would see my family again after this one ended . "" "" why was it so much fun to watch for you ? "" i ask in disgust . 
 "" well , as you can see , we were n't all bad , but it was pretty lame . the only reason i saw it was because i was a little busy waiting for something to happen and decided to watch it instead ."|0
it ' s difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film . jean - pierre limousin presumably had a good acting job in london , but he doesn ' t have much use for any of the films that are made there . some of them are funny , but most of them seem dull and tedious . the movie is just boring . i will not be able to buy one of those movies because it ' s too dull . i bought it on a whim when we went to see a film once , but now i think i should take it off my shelf and give it to somebody .|0
OK, so maybe it's because I'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like the guys in this film, but I found this great fun. Cheap fun to be sure, but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually quite effected when they died. In particulare when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well it;s a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered.|1
perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film . but , for whatever reason , the story does not end up being as entertaining as i thought it would . the plot is boring and makes me laugh every time i read one . there is definitely nothing interesting about the movie . i ca n't remember any movie i liked that was worth watching . some of the parts made me cry , but other parts seemed like they had gone on forever . i really hate this movie ! all i want now is to be alone .|0
okay , when i bought this flick i though this got ta be the ultimate b - movie , space monkey landing . but what is this about ? i do n't want to give up one of the most brilliant characters i have ever seen in my life . this movie has some very interesting characters who are just as smart and funny as they could be . it also has an even more fascinating plot line and a fantastic character development . for example , the story of a young man who gets kidnapped from his home and goes on a quest for revenge on his family .|0
i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels ; from production to plot and character development . this definitely is a classic film , and it is based on real people in the hollywood industry . i thought it was better than this movie because it was so unoriginal and uninteresting . also , i am not quite sure how to tell what the characters were like , or why they were making this film if they were acting . you can have no clue how bad this will sound . i think the title has already been written ( i just read about them in the early 2000s ) .|0
"like some other people wrote , i ' m a die - hard mario fan , and i loved this game . this is the best book i have ever seen . i just ca ' t believe what i read . i don ' t even care who else reads it . "" you ' ve seen this story , how ? "" i asked when he finished the last one . he was still watching the tv . "" there has to be something wrong with this movie . i mean really bad . that ' s got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen ."|0
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing this film,we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy,such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage,and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said, that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!|1
"A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (""scapegoat"") for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928."|1
this movie was painfully awful . most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods , walking thru the woods on a quest to find a lost loved one . how could such a horrible movie be so horribly bad ? i never thought it would lead to this kind of horror film . that is , if there had ever been any documentary about it . we did n't have much luck with that because none of us even watched it . we just watched and tried to get something positive out of the plot . unfortunately , as the movie continues to run its course , i start thinking about my parents .|0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn't as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession.|1
i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that did n ' t really show . in fact as far as i remember there were a half - dozen other films about the 1920s and the 1950s . i have been watching this one before . it is a classic blockbuster production that seems to involve all sorts of bad acting and an endless series of bad comedies . it gives little detail , though i am happy to say that i got the gist of what he was saying because i found it entertaining .|0
not too good a movie . sure , it contains action , but the effects are n ' t all that good . if you did not want to watch it , there were some really bad movies and i made fun of myself for not doing anything about it . i was glad i had chosen this movie , it was n't as bad as some others . i am sorry if you wanted this to be a cinematography on film . please take a seat and watch this while i continue with the rest of my day . i will leave the film in your hands for now .|0
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts).|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers.|1
"` ` strike force ' ' or ` ` the librarians ' ' is a fun action movie that does n ' t it take itself too seriously ? i thought so , and i was wrong ! the first film i see as a young kid is an episode of "" star trek . i 've always been a fan of old westerns but i never expected to watch one for real . what kind of a loser are these people who ca n't even get themselves straight ? there are some good movies in the series , but there are so many characters i could be mistaken for having seen them on the internet before ."|0
maybe it ' s just that it was made in 1997 , or maybe whoever managed to get this up to this point thought it might be a good idea . the whole thing is really quite fascinating . i think i have some great stories here . my first and only one - time husband was an actor who worked at a hollywood movie house and was never seen anywhere else . he took a job as an usher at a new production company but had a terrible time acting . i ' m sure this story would have been all over the internet by now if not for several years of dedicated work .|0
this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised . as a result of this film , i have no idea how it 's going to be made or how it happened , but i do know that there is not going to be any filming on this film . unfortunately for us , we are in the way . if you would rather watch this than to watch this movie , then perhaps it would be best if you did not watch this movie . however , after witnessing the destruction of the entire world , i can say with conviction that the book is not good .|0
i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago , and have seen every other version since , including one from my own personal experience . i 've never seen a scene that had such an impact upon a person as this one . to be able to see the movie when it 's on dvd is beyond amazing . there is just so much drama . even the actors are more than a few years older than they appear , but the plot is so interesting . i really liked what i saw in this movie .|0
"as one of the victims of the whole enron scandal , my mother forced me to watch this movie with her daughter . i have never seen the film before but when i saw it i had an idea about how to handle things if there is ever any sort of event that takes place on a public level in such a way . "" "" what are you doing with this movie ? ! "" my dad cried . "" do n't be ridiculous ! this is just plain wrong ! i thought it would be hilarious , now i see they are making it funny ."|0
This show is terrible. I cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. This is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. I have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.What the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights.|1
ah yet another seagal movie . in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves . as bad as this movie sounds , it does nothing for the kids who enjoy it . i have a feeling these children will never see the world through its eyes again . unfortunately , we will soon find out why . there is only one place on earth with enough film to get us through a ten year period . by the way , i can still feel the shock of the first time i saw those films . and the worst thing about it ?|0
What a cast...and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality. The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. Yeah, I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.The story is not only messy and unlikely, it also isn't exactly terribly original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies.|1
This movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. To go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing.|1
Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun.The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls.|1
I saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.I thought the little boy in the film was excellent. Mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this film is plain 'weird.' It's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time.|1
"i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b - movies and trying to get you to buy them . "" he shook his head , then reached for my hand again . "" so let me know what your favorite movie is . please call me at home and i will set the record straight . "" i giggled , which only made him laugh harder . he pulled me in for a quick kiss , then stepped away . "" bye . "" he watched me all the way back to my mother 's house until i turned to walk up the sidewalk ."|0
i just finished watching following and i thought it was great . i rated it 8 out of 10 . it seems like the best show i am ever given . i could have been a better actor though . so many times in high school i would sit on the edge of the stage and watch the stars as they passed overhead . but never did i see something like this . for one reason or another , my friends were at a party , and i was not even invited . i actually had an idea that i wanted to hear from them .|0
In general, I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend.|1
The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets.|1
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them."|1
"christopher nolan ' s first directorial effort , a year before he did ` ` memento , ' ' and this is almost the whole thing . ' but it was not one of those "" special "" films that are just for kicks . there is a lot about the plot that you do not know . i ' m sure your readers would like to find out what part of my film you like and how much you think about it . now , as a matter of fact , we didn ' t have time for this !"|0
I have watched two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I am no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful college life. I wish that I spent a little more time socializing. I kind of identify myself with rusty. When I was rushing a fraternity, my big brother was not like Cappie at all, I wish that I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters, then it is a pretty good show.It is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes.|1
"This movie has to be the worst film I have seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004. HELLO. ""Lord of the Rings"" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to Film and TV school."|1
when hoppity goes to town he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the lowlands . that is what this movie is all about and you can see it with your own eyes ( or so i hear ) . there 's a picture of the three of them together as they are walking back to their ranch . one of the most awful scenes of my whole life is being eaten by a huge bear - sized bear at the front of a cattle drive . the bear eats the poor young cowboy who was standing right under its snapping jaws while holding a baseball bat .|0
o boy , was this really bad . i saw this on videotape . in scenes that had soundtrack music , it was hard to believe anyone would do something like this . if you look at the screen over and over and over again , you wo n't see it . no , you just have to think about it a bit and realize that these are not videos at all . there are no pictures of what happened from any one location , but there are pictures of people playing around and some of them holding each other as if they were two or more old friends .|0
I rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.The plot... there is no plot. Everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog could've done better. The special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. And the cheesy lines.... I mean, why even bother? The only credit I can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes.|1
I have just caught this Movie on TCM, and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this was the best MGM could serve up to him. It is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. It featured two of my favouriteplayers in Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell(the best actor in the Film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady Frances Gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical.|1
dark and bleak sets , thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife ( or razor ) a perfect piece of art . it is hard to imagine how anyone could stand to watch this movie without actually feeling some pain . if you 're looking at this film , you probably already know all the actors ' names - i 'm just going to assume there is a story behind their name . what was in the video ? it 's not so bad . i do n't really know why i did n't see this movie before : i have lots of other movies to keep me busy .|0
i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece . i ' d recommend to buy this movie on dvd . i hope you enjoyed this book , as well as all of the stories that come out of it . thank you for reading my story and making it special ! i know it was very good , especially in the beginning . this movie is totally unoriginal , and does not look like anything that i will ever have seen in any of these movies , but it still gives me great pleasure . it shows how hard it really is for people to understand what it is they are missing in their entire lives .|0
i was expecting a lot from this movie , and i can say i have n ' t been disappointed . first of all , i have to know where the hell he gets his ideas for films . i do n't really want to hear that again . second , the plot is stupid , it makes me laugh on the way in , and the acting is horrible . third , i think i am going to need a long rest when i get home . why do i have to spend an entire day with no tv ?|0
this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots , dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly . i am quite impressed by the overall performance of the film . i will give a special rating to anyone who can watch it . i find it hard to believe that this is what i was missing in the first two weeks . as a result of watching the movie i was not particularly interested in seeing much of any of the details . i think there are things more important for a person to see than the actual execution of an evil movie .|0
i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though.|1
there is no reason to watch this film . why ? many reasons . first up , the acting is awful . but i have n't seen this movie yet and i love watching it . second , the plot is so boring and unimaginative that you just feel like talking to your own self . if only you could have a little bit of dialogue with your own thoughts . this was a really bad idea after all . what a load of crap ! in the film it seems as if these people are just trying to make fun of each other .|0
do n ' t get me wrong . i ' ve got a considerable soft spot for the works of charles band , though i suppose it would have been preferable to being in this business . but the music is not really about what you make of the work that makes them happy . or how you turn them into something other than what they actually are . most of my time was spent in the studio . i never knew much about music , and i know very little about any of the songs that are written in the studio . the only good thing that came out of this was the singing .|0
Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm? !,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.|1
i ' m pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n ' t be accused of unfair bias in the story . and , as you can tell , my father would like a little help from his peers in this issue . the story is based on an example of a woman who lives alone in a small rural town and has seen a lot of strange people in her life . these things may sound odd to you now but i have seen how they look at other people . many people are treated badly by some of the people in the town because of their lack of understanding .|0
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.In relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. Years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series.|1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece.|1
legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff ( splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne ) had been given a chance to take control of a real , life - and - death drama . at the end of the film , i could barely keep from laughing . this movie was horrible , so terrible in fact that it did more damage to my mental health than it did to anyone else . all you can think about is how many times one should go to the hospital and check on the poor man . after an hour or two , i just got tired of thinking about it .|0
"There are places for political commentary in film, but ""Masters of Horror"" is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another ""Bush is bad!"" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a ""message"" film, be a little more sly about it."|1
So keira knightly is in it...So automatically we compare this film to attonement. Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.The Actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.If you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.This film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath.|1
"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister."|1
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up. what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie?|1
"this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver . he meets up with a woman named rachel in a warehouse . when they arrive , she asks him why he has the car parked at his apartment . the man simply says he just wants to show off the car . rachel laughs . the woman tells him he is being ridiculous . he looks back and says , "" i really am not going to bother you with this . let me show you the city . you will like what you see when you enter . "" the woman walks away laughing ."|0
young , ambitious nurse ms . charlotee ( rosie holotik ) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the desert southwest . she spends the first twenty - four hours alone and suffers from depression . we can not find any more information on her or her children because they are all dead by the time we get back to our story . it is interesting that there is very little to tell about their lives , but it seems like there has always been someone else out there who believes that something terrible is going on . this may have been the real reason why many of the kids ended up in foster care .|0
warning : plot spoilerthe always - abnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . fans of his earlier films love what he is doing on screen . and they also like what he shows , even if it does make a bad movie . although i would strongly advise you not to be too surprised by this in any way possible , there has been nothing else for me so far about this project . it seems to have been fairly good , as long as you did n't read too much of it . i just do n't understand why someone would waste all of their time on this nonsense !|0
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from Getty Images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?)|1
sorry for all you guys that are not family with the lynches . my sister in law asked me how you can do something so stupid , and when i told her it made me laugh . why ? why did i have to be such a complete jerk at this very moment ? why does it hurt so much to hear your name mentioned by an old friend ? i am so tired of hearing about your family . i just want to know why you ca n't seem to understand how important you are and what you want to achieve .|0
i kind of like jag . it do have its charm but lately its to much propaganda in it . when you watch a movie you will not see it as an original , which is just about the dumbest thing that ever happened on this film . i mean who wants to watch a movie that was so great that they had to go back and watch it ? ! i hate this movie even though it is good . the actors are dumb and boring . they all try to make a move on the camera with no luck .|0
i wanted to like this movie . i really , really did . i was so excited when i saw the movie on the internet . it was so much fun and i loved watching it . after a little bit i realized that i had been getting way too bored in my entire life . all of the movies made me think that they were more fun just watching than actually doing something else . so i started going off and acting . i have often thought about what a great movie it could possibly be . one thing led to another .|0
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. That's James Brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse?|1
i just can not emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is . justthe memory of this movie right now is just too hard to bear . every single one of the characters and even some of the scenes themselves are so bad it 's hard to really watch them . there is no film that does n't make my teeth hurt ( especially in this particular one ) but i ca n't seem to find anything else to say . it feels like i 've just been watching an uninteresting movie with absolutely no understanding of how you should feel when things happen .|0
"Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, ""Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead. ""But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy."|1
I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film missed its marks. Several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. It sets you up for the laugh. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. They weren't funny unless you were five.|1
this is a pretty simplistic romance . girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl becomes boy , girl finds man , girl discovers the truth of life . what happened here was a little out of place by any modern standards in my opinion but i am happy to say that everything seems to work out . it was not so bad once we started watching the movie and were able to find out some good points . when we finally got the chance to take a photo , the first thing that i really noticed about it was that the whole scene looked like a comedy from the start .|0
i love watching the jericho mile . i mean watching peter strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt on the matrix . you can see for miles and miles , and it just goes on and on and on . i loved watching the sequel to the movie a great deal . i especially loved watching the version about the man who comes out of nowhere to kill the people he killed . this was something i could never have had the nerve to watch . there are many ways to kill someone with an electric gun , but that ' s exactly what we did .|0
ahh , nuthin ' like cheesy , explopitative , semi - porn , masquerading as horror . . . this one stars jaqueline lovell who goes about his everyday business of working on a movie he knows is not supposed to be out there . . . except it is really happening , and i do n't mean in an embarrassing way . no . . . i mean the film is just so ridiculous that i ca n't help but chuckle . . . for what it 's worth though , i think these scenes were probably made by another person .|0
very poor script and acting . i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with just enough money and influence to get this film done . in the end , the director made the movie work . it was one of the most popular films of the last decade . the director was a well - known guy who became famous as a writer on two occasions . both times , you get an award from him and you know how much he liked writing these kinds of films . it was so good that my family had to buy them .|0
One of the best,Lackawanna BluesGreat movie,great cast,great music,this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes,I will w3atch this one many times. This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period.|1
this is a snuff movie . i ' m shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library . when i saw the film i started to believe that there was some truth to the movies . however , seeing how one of the characters has lost his mind and tries to destroy the human race by attacking humans , made me wonder if it was such a bad idea to go through with the whole screening . i could not see what the original actors were going to think as well , so let ' s skip the part of the actor ' s face and ask the real questions .|0
"Ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...This one stars Jaqueline Lovell(sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in ""Femalien"", ""The Erotic House of Wax"", and that family favorite ""Nude Bowling Party"". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. ""Head of the Family"" actually tries to be a real moovie. A con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed."|1
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.Unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. Earl Dwire plays a halfbreed white and Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day.He and his gang happen upon Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don't have anything worth robbing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and have his way with her.|1
i hate movies that end like this ! ! ! ! this 16mm disaster is full of cliches , stereotypical comedies and stupid plot points . the plot has a completely different cast to it , much more sophisticated and realistic than what you get at disney . the actors do their best to make sense of everything and try to figure out who was responsible for creating the entire film . as such , one thing they seem to be trying to do right now is not let go of reality . they ca n't help it ; they just feel sorry for other people .|0
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it wasn't good. Actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to Nora Roberts.I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, Forlani wasn't alone.|1
"As was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former ""Wayne's World"" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films."|1
"""Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father""- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her."|1
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful! !, as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, not a damn thing happens!. All the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!,plus The ending is especially lame!. The only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however he is wasted here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever!, plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over!.|1

When naïve young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser at Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role.|1
After watching this film, I thought to myself, they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really nice eye candy. They really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of Hollywood just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.Why am I critiquing this film? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver.|1
"One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, ""Ten Cents a Dance"" stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dance-hall girl ""Barbara"" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite ""plain-jane"" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who's very different from the dashing Carlton."|1
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race.|1
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some Northern idiots come to the deep South looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are menaced by scary hillbillies, in a wide nod to 'Deliverance'; but it turns out that the hicks are fronting for a Northern marijuana-trafficking badass. This is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. The women are locked up and raped into catatonia; rather than rescuing them, the guys run down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them.|1
an unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with kay francis as the countess balakireff chasing everything in pants . at the beginning of the film there was only about five or six feet between the two characters when it all started and it went very wrong . the plot was bad but the plot was even worse ; it is so unfunny i had to look down on this movie for awhile . the first thing i heard about this movie was how the characters could not act , they simply did not . then i noticed that they seemed to have some sort of special ability to sing a different tune than any of the others .|0
I cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. I've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. I haven't made a comment on IMDb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. It is a piece of sh*t. The writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager.|1
I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years.|1
in his descriptions of caa , platinum card lunches in hollywood , psychoanalysis , a vacation in provincetown he never takes seriously to the extreme . i 've had it for a decade now and my life has been one full of tragedy and drama . i thought i was getting along great until the last minute when this guy came up and tried to take my car . i asked him to leave before he hurt me or something but he kept coming . i could n't understand why he wanted to kidnap me like that . i thought he was some kind of serial killer .|0
this is one of those movies that you just do n ' t want to end . the characters are rich like the movie and they have no idea how to work around it . the comedy is pretty awful and the plot is hilarious but i hate the characters , i thought i was getting to see them in action . when i first went through the movie i thought it would be fun , but after seeing the movie with the audience , i realize that it did n't even improve the acting level . it was definitely bad .|0
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it.|1
"Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. Sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his card buddies. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family.Faith, family, and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune--""Return to Me."|1
everyone knows that late night movies are n ' t oscar contenders . fine . i mean i ' ll admit that i don ' t like this movie but i also can ' t say i care much for it anyway . the character is bad , the dialogue is horrible and the acting is a total waste of time . i was disappointed in my choice of films when i first saw them . the premise seemed to make perfect sense and the overall story seemed to be a good plot piece . unfortunately , i really don ' t know if this movie is even supposed to be good .|0
"...now please move on because that's getting on my nerves.Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""To Die For"" (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake) started an experimental phase with ""Gerry"", which reached its peak with the thought-provoking ""Elephant"". ""Last Days"" had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while ""Paranoid Park"", his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else."|1
"so if a guy meets you and he says ' i want you to look at my erection ! ' it would be an interesting situation . i ca n't believe how dumb i can be for believing such a preposterous suggestion . there is just no way the man with the big dick would ever actually do this movie . i must say that i was stunned at the amount of money in the dvd , but the premise is pretty good . as i watched it , i was reminded of one of the films i had seen in the late 1980 's . """|0
first of all , let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i ' d been sold out on a real live horror movie . even though this film is the best one that i have ever seen so far , i don ' t know how much more boring it would be to watch a bad sci - fi film that has no characters , or plot whatsoever . the only thing i enjoyed about this movie was the fact that in addition to some good dialogue with a few comedians , it turned into quite an experience for the audience .|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at a different stage of life.The movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you have seem them before. Yet I would not want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note.|1
i left the theater , and i was only 10 years old . that ' s how bad it sucked . i still feel like a failure on my first day at this job , even more so in my undergrad school classes . but no matter , i knew that i could make it for another five years before having to choose between doing what is best for the rest of my life or making a terrible movie . i wanted to be an actress , but did not really have a choice . as a result , i was stuck with just being an ordinary kid who spends most of her time talking about movies .|0
"why would i say that ? because when the movie ended , i was in a good mood . so it was easy to get out of the car and stand on the sidewalk with my feet planted firmly on the asphalt as i looked forward to getting back to the hotel . 
 "" where are you going ? "" i called after her . she had stopped walking and turned around to give me a smile . 
 "" do n't worry , i 'm staying at the bellagio , "" she laughed . "" it 's very beautiful . it 's one of the finest hotels in san diego ."|0
Think Jumanji but with a death curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. Supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. Okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.Frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy has run but certainly its not the best.|1
boy oh boy , does this movie stink . this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen . i thought it would be good to try my hand in a film but it just makes me gag . when the final credits roll , i look around and notice there are only two people left . so , i go to sit next to the other three and ask them if they like it . one of them says yes that 's what i thought at first but i could see the disappointment from the other two . it must have cost $ 29.99 .|0
if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands , the world would be in grave danger . but it did not have to be like this . i know i 'm not looking for a sci - fi / horror flick , but this movie is quite a different story than what i 'd expect from one of the other books that came out recently . it starts with an old woman dying of cancer . at first i thought she was having an affair with her husband because he had n't seen her in over three decades , but then something else catches my attention .|0
Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be.|1
Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest, the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history, one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal, as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair, our eyes are truly opened.|1
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. The two whom show up fall in love. The 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out. Okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together..slightly weird here...Harry Carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick.|1
director jeremiah checheck who brought us big budget debacles like ` ` the avengers ' ' and the remake of ` ` diabolique ' . there is even a good film by this name ; it may be a little old for my tastes but it has its own story and character . i have seen it on other occasions but at the time i really did not think about what it was all about . why should anyone pay any more attention to the real world than an innocent teenage kid who 's just getting into college ? when i first saw it on television last week , i actually had the sense to buy it .|0
ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs , watermellons , people , etc . this film does not have a sequel to this film and therefore there is no plot with which to explain why i decided to stay in new york city . after all , what else do you expect from a guy like me who has been writing for years ? i am a good writer so i can understand why my dad wants to get back out of the house , even though it seems like an impossible task . but i also know that this film was not made just for me .|0
i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it ! i scored it a 1 in this contest . not only that , but i could see the money at the end and knew that if i won it would earn its title . however , i ca n't wait for the big prize . i loved all the prizes because they reminded me of the life i had before coming here - the great love of my life . the only thing that kept me going when i grew up was knowing that i did n't want anything more than to be an astronaut .|0
I'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. This was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to Down Below. Unfortunately unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place off station. I didn't care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair. I like Lochley but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. Personally I can only give it 1/10.|1
One should not be too critical about the director's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.However, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.Any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.|1
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist, helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best, but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieves some poignancy, but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury, a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting.|1
significant spoilers ! this is a sick , disturbing movie . . . just like the sick , twisted director , jennifer moe . she is an amateur actress with a terrible plot that could never be made up ( but there is no way in hell it can be ) . the only thing about her story that makes me want to see this movie more than i have wanted anything else since i saw it is that she is very attractive , but i am not particularly fond of her and she has nothing on me except my money . so what do i do about it ?|0
harmony korine . i ' m not sure what he was trying to do with this film . if it was , it probably was no big deal . a lot of people are in the process of coming up with some kind of story or movie that they want to keep as a source of information for the viewers and the readers . maybe it ' s been there for awhile and you just don ' t see it very often . most people around here have nothing more interesting to talk about than a great movie where they get involved in an ongoing plot to create a good horror film based on real people .|0
"""Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters"" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it."|1
"It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. Bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. He was quietly moving in the TV movie ""Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus"" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed ""The Indian Runner"".In ""The Evil That Men Do"", however, Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns."|1
I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated of course, and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now. But even allowing for this, Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost laughable. The scripting is awful, just awful, with no characterisation at all. The performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines.|1
"The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was... not very good at all.Like others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.I thought the ending was rather unbelievable.By the way guys, about the ""blow torch in space"".Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name ""Oxy-Acetylene torch""). Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.So a ""blow torch"" would work just fine in space."|1
the series finally hits rock - bottom with this lousy fourth installment , which was ( thank god ) the last one and it was only the beginning . by the end , there was just nothing left but a pile of blank pages . after the first couple of episodes , they all came to an abrupt stop and went completely blank . that is , for the most part ; the only people who got any ideas about the story were mike and i , and i have tried to convince them that we did not want to play this movie at all .|0
"Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like ""Urban Cowboy"", ""Every Which Way But Loose"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same ""Urban Cowboy"" crowd. Instead ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title."|1
I did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. The suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. What kept it going were the good actors.But the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like Tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. Tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min.|1
"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now""."|1
that is what this movie is . good god the special effects suck in this movie . it is difficult to see much of the characters , if at all , you just see a very large amount of one - sided dialogue . the actors are more than willing to talk , but most are too shy or nervous for the story to get any interesting details about the script . it 's hard to see how they even can tell us what happened here . my guess is that the director and directors were not really looking forward to making this film , they were just going to make it up on their own merits .|0
i was watching the sci - fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on . while not as bad as the sci - fi channels , it was definitely less interesting than the reality tv show . then there 's the movie trailer . for example , you can see the screen where the characters have been brainwashed by some sort of drug lord who has tricked them into a false belief that the world is full of aliens . and then there 's the horror movie itself . it shows an entire planet being consumed by the flames of hell .|0
this is precious . everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue . i am very fond of these words , for they have made a huge difference in the movie - the characters and scenery seem like they are on top of the game . but if you were to read what is on the screen , you would see that not one word was written by any of the characters in the movie . the only things which could have been remotely entertaining about this film , were the content and their acting .|0
there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas presents from his neighbors . it must have been awful . what a tragedy . for the second time in less than one hour . when i say ' terrible , ' i am not exaggerating here . this was an atrocious performance by a bunch of kids who just loved to play pranks . you could tell that they were into it ; they went to the theater and watched all the silly movies that people would like to watch .|0
"Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent ""civilised warfare"" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme."|1
Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD.|1
"For a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment, but certainly not here. Even the ""miracle"" scenes were contrived & un-believable. And what's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story?"|1
"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" or any such ""deep"" concept."|1
I kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. It just meandered along to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.|1
"uncle fred olen ray once again gives us a little of his retromedia ` ` goodness ' ' in the form of an action movie . one thing i can say for the film is : no matter how much you try to make this film , you are doomed to fail . as long as all you do is play along with the plot , the audience doesn ' t have a clue that what you "" re about to see is really happening . the only good thing that has come out of this movie is that it wasn ' t a complete blockbuster ."|0
we ' ve all got to start somewhere , it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like us used to be able to do . at least i thought it might have been a film - but it turns out there really is no film . just a series of awful images . every single character is as bad as the last . they don ' t have any money , or anything to speak of . not a single actor , movie director , or actor even makes the effort to perform . and it ' s just plain sad .|0
the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing , in which objects such as dvd and video films are found missing from every movie . that ' s all i have time for . but i wish you would write this down on a piece of notepaper and let us try to find it . i do not believe that this film ever had anything worthwhile to add to it so far . it just does not have anything to give me any ideas at all . it is one thing to be a writer ; it is another to read through the book without even considering its worth .|0
While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) I must say that I thought the script and acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has crafted a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven delight. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. Her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet Bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open.|1
other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard . for something made by an eighteen year old boy , it has some special effects , but not all of the character is that well behaved . he certainly does n't deserve to walk away from this movie , but i suppose if someone had told me i would have said ' oh my god ' . here 's what i wanted you to know about him : he is actually a brilliant actor . he gets on so well with his parents . one of these days he might become a rock star .|0
i seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here . but i really did not find this movie very interesting . there was n't much to watch , except for an annoying episode where a couple of kids are kidnapped by two men . the boys are in jail and they go out to the beach . that 's when the police take them away and put them in the water . it does make me think about the time i spent on shore with my father . at first i had a good idea of what would happen if the kidnappers came back .|0
Actually I'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some folks will expect it anyway. First let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... To the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please.|1
scarecrow gone wild starts as high school teenager mike ( david zelina ) & his mates decide to to give it their best shot . and they succeed . in a big way . there are lots of good comedies and comedy movies that go along with this one , and most of those have been taken by actors and artists . but the last film i saw was at the age of 13 . i did n't want to watch it . my parents were very serious when i watched it , and the fact that it ended like this is the first time i have been allowed to watch it in a while .|0
have you ever read a book , then seen the movie , and wonder - how did they screw it up so bad ? ' but this is not what i wanted to hear when i came over to your place . my first impression of the movie is that it was poorly made . i am going to change that ; i am going to be an excellent director . i do believe that some of the actors are trying to sell their stories out to other people . this movie is just really horrible , i can see why someone would choose to use it in such a way as this .|0
Yet again, director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a cosy life on a Caribbean island.|1
"As a kid, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing.I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it, instead, on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. I figured, this HAD to be better. I was wrong.The movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an ""evil wind."""|1
"... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging."|1
the film was half over before i managed to figure out what was going on . it ' s a dog that has been given a very bad name . you must not make any attempt to read the plot because the characters , however they play , are just plain mean . so much so that there is nothing in this book about being a dog . there is a picture of a young boy , who has long dark hair , and an evil looking face . after he had gotten past his initial dislike for me , he suddenly developed a great desire to learn how to play a banjo .|0
"After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his ""Masterpiece"" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.So I have at least these five questions in my mind:1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Stéphanois. He couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car."|1
"The Hell's Angels did come out the losers in this movie. Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were stoops to even appear, much less be ""technical advisers"" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. Hell's Angles on JAP bikes? C'mon!

Well, this is new...Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called...Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films.|1

Ben Marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.The job Ben applies is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house.|1
Imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. Otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens.|1
This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975.|1
this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended , i was seething with anger . it was all just a way to have some fun . and it worked ! i could actually feel myself getting mad at what i was watching but now that i am home i can appreciate why it was so good . for one thing , it was about as entertaining as if i watched a horror flick . the movie did have something to do with the guy who tried to break my heart when he came back from the dead .|0
"It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial ""wake-up call"". And, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. Such is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities as I have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. So, I was unaware of the majority of what Lawrence had gone through prior to this film."|1
possibly the worst movie i ever saw . the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film it , even when it started out . the plot is terrible : a guy meets his girl , she starts dating him , they start dating , and suddenly all the problems between the two guys happen . as if things are n't bad enough , then someone comes along and ruins everything . i do n't think i ever want to see this again . let 's hope this film does have some good humor in it . this was one of the worst movie awards i have ever seen .|0
rabbit fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches , each one of them focussing on a female personal device that is supposed to have special powers . when i was young , i used to watch tv for hours on end , and i could not believe it . this show had been doing better than i imagined it would . however , with every minute i spent viewing it i felt more and more disgusted at the way they treated girls , who were being taught how to do some really bad things . in fact , some of my favourite films are even worse than this show .|0
28 years before 9 / 11 , there was another 9 / 11 which represented a key date in the history of chile , and that was 15 years before the world was made . this film is a work of fiction based on actual events that occurred to the people i have spoken with at this point in time . let me give you my impressions of the first 5 episodes and how many times they had shown this movie over and over again . if you could see the effects on the quality of the film , what would you imagine it to be like ?|0
the girls might be prettier if you ' re their accompanist or a $ # ! + - faced onlooker . what i mean is that one of them was on the wrong team when they went into this show . they could have won an oscar , but it just didn ' t happen . they were really good , but i ' m disappointed that it did . i had expected something a little more along the lines of ' i ' and ' ' i ' . unfortunately for these guys , they were not able to make a career out of showing off the talent they had .|0
"hubie - - like stanely the troll from bluth ' s a troll in central park - - lacks the spark of personality that stephen king lacked - without a sense of self , and with no sense of identity . i believe this to be an example of the "" you do what you have to do "" line . however , i wish to remind you that i am simply trying to keep track of how long this film is going to last . for instance , i was so sure that we would end up watching this film once or twice a month ."|0
it ' s a talking , trigger happy , alcoholic ass cop ! i have seen the first and second episodes of night out on the internet . they are always one - dimensional . this was definitely one of these shows . as much as i would love to see that movie , i just don ' t want to witness the drama . so i turned off all the tv at home ( in fact i did ) and made myself a sandwich for dinner because if i had to watch another show , i might lose my appetite .|0
After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and they invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels.|1
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like ""Waterworld"" than anything else. I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like ""hoist the mainstay!"""|1
I hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not actors.This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives.|1
the first few minutes of this movie do n ' t do it justice ! for me , its not funny until i start making jokes like that . it 's hilarious at first , but then it starts to get creepy . you should see the guys from the tv with their dicks sticking out of their shirts . i was in the army as a kid . they were the worst kind of idiots . there is no humor and no comedy . there is nothing funny about it . you know what ? i do n't care . i think this movie is bad .|0
Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.|1
no blood , no sex ( though it oozes passion ) , no special effects , but just one of the very good things about hollywood . at least on the cheap , you get to watch the first installment and learn about what kind of film it is supposed to be . i liked this movie when i was a kid , but then my favorite movie is the last two . i thought this was a bad time to try to watch movies . the only reason i even remember this movie is because i had seen them in a few other films back in the early 1990s .|0
"I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course as I'm sure you know that ""Malcolm's in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes ""The Amanda Show"" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure that we can all re-late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywood.SPOILERS AHEADAs it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems."|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. The jokes where really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about Mongolian history, traditions etc. My co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost.|1
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive.In its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film.|1
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road...|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra.|1
where would hollywood have been without fredric march as robert browning or dennis price as lord byron , famous lovers of the world . if you like this movie , then let me be the first one to comment . there was nothing funny about the film , but it was amusing and made for a comedy . the only other thing that made it fun was the soundtrack . the plot was very good , although i did get a slight hint of an attempt at humour . this movie was very well - crafted by someone who knew how to make something that could not be described as being funny .|0
"I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war ""hippies"" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army."|1
Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and god bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.Exploitation films should be judged on story, sex, and gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place.|1
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced, frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. I'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King.|1
this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as the robe , quo , it 's like one of those old sci - fi films you see on tv but have not seen in person . i am shocked when the woman in the film tells a man that if he were to give money to her husband ( she says they are so high school sweethearts she would n't be caught dead with him ) that he should marry her . obviously , he was too young to be taken seriously , which made me laugh .|0
Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.Ever seen Pontypool?|1
You'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!|1
This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do.|1
"I had seen this movie when I was a boy (Before WWII) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a ""A"" movie. No editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a ""B"" Had a laugh at how jaded I've become over the years. Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it."|1
a good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others . it ' s a horse racing movie , and it ' s a good movie for cowboys and indians . unfortunately i ca ' t see the point of making a movie in which you can ' t make fun of horses . if you don ' t like the film you ' re better off leaving the movies to some professionals who can help you find your way around . at the end of the movie i ' ll say i was disappointed to see that one of the riders won ' t ride an easy horse - race .|0
This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is charming as ever as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real-life author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour-guide and translator, Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a hip-hop-lovin' Ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II.|1
the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except that in this film it is actually a large black - winged creature flying around the arena , and it acts as if it is not capable of fighting . i do n't think i have ever seen a video where there are more of these animals . one minute carnosaur attacks a boy , but suddenly he loses his footing and falls face forward into the middle of the cage . the other dinosaurs attack the boy like they are on steroids and then go nuts .|0
"1931 also presented ""an American tragedy"", the original tale of ""who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl"". this was a truly entertaining film. Babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. Monroe owsley, unmemorably played Babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing Crosby of ""the big broadcast"" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. Ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold."|1
* * may contain spoilers * * the main character , a nobleman named fallon , is stranded on an island with his friends . not only do they have no clue what the story is about , they are totally oblivious and completely oblivious to the existence of the plot . as you know , i used to spend my last two months in new york city writing one of the first novels that was released after years of non - existent copyrights . now i am at my wit 's end but still think this movie is something worth watching .|0
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary ""Don't Look Now"" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema."|1
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature footage, bad acting - Aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well off each other. There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I do say so myself.The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day.|1
"has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene - by - scene remake of the 1933 version , with some of the characters taking part ? "" jack chuckled . "" i have no idea why you ask that . what kind of person would it be to get into an acting program where they 're trying to put together a successful movie about their past lives ? and even if it did succeed in the first place , what good would it do to tell the truth about the events that led up to his demise ?"|0
An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada.|1
this is one of a rarity of movies , where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it . this film was made at the beginning of the movie . the story has not been written or filmed for over four hundred years ; in fact , i had no idea it was even possible to produce a film with that much money . it does not look very good and just looks bad , as if the film is going to make you ill . however , here we are in the early hours of the morning , and so far , the movie appeared to be nothing short of funny .|0
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.After every Lnych movie I tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.So, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it.|1
"This is a forgotten classic of a film, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for ""Gummo"". Gummo is good, River's Edge is way, way better. Its no secret that Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. No, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover."|1
this movie is not just good , its amazing . besides providing us with good performances , original plot , and music production , it is a total mess . you guys are going to laugh when i say this . let me finish . in our early chapters , the author of that movie ' d really wanted to get his hands on a copy of the new york playhouse , but could n't . instead , he got something else from the box office . he wrote an autobiography called the red notebook . he did this without the help of a typewriter or any other kind of machine .|0
"Perhaps I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama. As to the story it was trying to tell, I found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. And perhaps it should have been made by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented English. I can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar ""artist's model's tragic fate"" plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING."|1
my girlfriend wanted to see this ( lol this is the case a lot ) . . . so i rented it for the night . i was not sure what to expect after all that had happened at the bar . i decided to stay out of the way for a few minutes , as the girls made their way up the stage . then i thought about how much i hate karaoke . there are only so many people who like to sing and dance in one place . oh god , this is bad . i ca n't listen to any more .|0
I can't believe I sat through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUPPOSED to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't. The only saving grace is that it was on cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.|1
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this film. One: Okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited.|1
anything park chan - wook creates is guaranteed to be unique , brilliant , and very twisted at a minimum . well , it 's just one of many ways that this game plays out . the main characters all look like they got bored with the game or went home , or were both too tired and bored to pay attention to anything else . let 's face it , when you spend your entire life as a movie producer , you tend to come up with little else to do besides play the game and make sure no one messes with your film .|0
"I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (""I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!)."|1
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date , this year , it is one of my favorites . the only thing that was missing was an action adventure or some other kind of fun horror film . i also like to think that the most boring movies in existence do n't even exist because they were not as interesting as they could have been . the main reason for the exception being the title itself , but i am sure you will learn that the original story is pretty boring . i hope that there are no more films like this , because i have never seen any of them before .|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There wasn't any of that here. When Greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged.|1
Beware, My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I did.A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside.|1
Ah! When good actors take on bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialog is just plain silly.But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will LOVE this movie!|1
i loved it . in fact , i watched it over and over and over , and i could watch it for hours and never get bored . if you have n't noticed , i was always amazed at how few episodes would be released from the public library or on any other network . what is more impressive , however , are the books that pop up every time someone comes through the door . these are not only a lot of fun to watch , they make me laugh ! i think it is just an act of comedy . some people like this movie , and others love it .|0
My Mother Frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill).Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight.|1
a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek , quiet , but very large gardener - like human . i do n't know why she does this or what the motivation behind it is . but i believe it has something to do with her parents and how she managed to remain so far away from them when they died . i did n't have much of a clue how close she was to them until recently , but now that i think about it , it must have been really difficult for her to keep herself apart from them in spite of their attempts to make her become one of them .|0
Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.|1
"sorry about that . but if you have seen this ` ` epic ' ' , you will obviously know of the technical side of this film , because there was no mention of anything like it before . i do not think we would have appreciated it , and i doubt anyone in this city would have thought to write something like this . as a matter of fact , some people were quite angry with me . "" he held his hands behind his back so they could both see him clearly . "" oh , yes , i got a couple of things wrong ."|0
Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.Yea, basically that's the short of it. There's more to it than that, but I still have no clue what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English.|1
going into the movie with the right expectations , i somewhat liked this movie . like most reviewers who have read the entire script , they had no reason to expect to be disappointed in this particular film . of course , you can not tell me that there would ever be a ' good time ' or even a ' decent time ' . the plot was poorly done and completely meaningless . as for the characters , well , some of these characters are extremely dumb , but we do n't have time to waste ! the first thing we should know is where this movie was going .|0
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers.|1
ordinarily , anthony mann made westerns with ' the big guys ' - james stewart , gary cooper , henry fonda and other men i had never seen . this was definitely not one of his favorites , and i did n't know what to think about it . i was disappointed when he went to the movies . i expected him to watch something more interesting . that is , until i got into his office . even though this was supposed to be a good film , it looked really lame compared to what he was doing . some of the dialogue was awful , but the plot was well written .|0
"This is absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset. The acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. The end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care. The one exception to this is the lead character ""Joe"" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!)"|1
matt cvetic is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party , but his efforts are too weak . it seems that he can be found in an abandoned house , which he uses as an excuse for his presence . on this particular afternoon , i witnessed the same crime scene film from earlier in the evening and immediately had the feeling that i should stay away because of the obvious danger involved . the victim appeared to have been taken alive by the terrorists during some sort of terrorist plot .|0
I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war.|1
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one that really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing.|1
"Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with ""real live"" native dancers. It's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). Throughout the film, Emanuelle is going after every man she meets."|1
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a turkey and the some. What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive I think so).|1
as a big dostoyevsky fan , i had always been disappointed with hollywood ' s halfhearted attempts to get into the limelight . this film is not like any other movie i has seen ( though there are times that i have watched a few ) . this movie is nothing like what i expected for the first and only one episode in a lifetime . it does have an awful lot of flair and action , but i would never have pegged it as even remotely funny . the reason why so many of the movies did n't make it home is that most of the people on the show were actors .|0
this movie is very modern and forward . it is about 75 % in english . it is aimed at some people on the side of the road who are working for a different cause but that does n't matter since they are only pretending to be part of a plot . so , when i started watching this film , i could not wait to see what would happen if i saw the truth about the war against the evil army of aliens . however , as the story continues , i am beginning to realize that no one here really knows anything about what exactly is going on .|0
one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills , in an attempt to keep their budget up - to date . there is not much good to be had if you do n't think about your films . and what really sucks is i always get to watch them before anyone else does . that way it 's a bit of a letdown as the credits start to play . i 'm just trying to avoid thinking about how many movies i will have to watch during my last film , which i wo n't say is the worst or worse movie i have seen all summer .|0
"This show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the contestants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was ""Survivor"" or something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together."|1
(Possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away. )I just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic.|1
the movie was very good . i ' m an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to watch it so i know all of the plot points and characters by heart . but this one did n't really do it for me . i think it would have been more entertaining if they had . . .no that is not why i liked this movie . i just didn ' t believe it was worth watching . my eyes were tired and i went over to sit on the sofa , but the movie got interrupted by a woman in her forties wearing a red skirt and a red blouse .|0
That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks.|1
At the time of this writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of Chris Penn. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from.I still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.Anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by Bananarama.|1
Larry Bishop, the Writer/Actor/Director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The film is a bomb.The Victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists.|1
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. Sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.The Evil Below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads.|1
maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here . well , in the end all that is required is to say that you think that it might not be too bad for a film but that this movie is pretty much a disaster . what can you do with that ? if you think that your career has an impact on your personal life then you are going to be wrong . people get involved in movies ; they get confused about their feelings , and then they start to go nuts . everyone else gets confused and starts to go crazy .|0
"This is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. It uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of Creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called ""horror"" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. There is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well.."|1
"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.I also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, ""that was perfect""."|1
so unfortunately me and my mate watched this ! ! ! it was showing on a sky channel over here , ' ( as i am sure you can tell from the movie ) ' . but it is really no better than what i had seen before . it was not one of their best movies either , that has to do with people in various stages of life . although it seems to be quite interesting , i think it should be written about other people . instead , this movie is based around a woman who finds herself having an affair with her high school boyfriend .|0
"""Christmas in Connecticut"" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's ""perfect farm"" for the Christmas holiday."|1
this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen . the visuals were so dang choppy it made me want to get my hand down my pants for a cigarette . and when they finally started having a scene , i just could n't take it anymore . i am not sure what went on , but the character is horrible . it was like there was this huge hole in the movie that people had to crawl into to find their way out again . then the credits started rolling and you know it does n't end well . i mean really sucks !|0
"OK, when I say ""wow,"" I mean, ""Jesus, please help me."" I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. WATCH OUT!!! And by that, I mean watch out for those special effects. There is an amazing number of mistakes. The acting is terrible, but I'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the Sheriff."|1
Oh man, this movie was toe-cringing bad. Bad look, awful story...the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie.Yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it. You can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting, that was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a couple of over-the-top sequences obviously.|1
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years.|1
okay , i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out a lot of the trash . so i do not know what it was that made you decide to save it . i will admit that i felt like it was my last movie . there are some good ones , as for the film itself , which is really good . but the acting is terrible . after about an hour of watching and thinking about it , i decided i would probably like to go to live oaks . i just never wanted to go to live oaks .|0
for me , this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles series . they are about an actor who has to find a girl to share a love affair with . and if you are not in love with her , then why are you so worried about her feelings ? because she is not as wonderful as her mother . all the actors seem to know more about each other than their peers , and they are too boring to make it on film . when the show was cast and cast , some of my friends were really impressed with these guys .|0
deepa mehta ' s ` ` fire ' ' is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic . a masterful social commentary on the movie should have been more in order , but i simply could not get my mind around it . however , while it sounds like fun to watch , i was too caught up with all this to make an effort to think about anything else . if you wanna see a movie about how much money you 've made , that ' s your right - hand man for you . what did you expect when you got down to the basics of writing a good story ?|0
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb, so even I sensed something rotten in it's synopsis I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. The Hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly.|1
Ok, when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, maybe one of the greatest B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story isn't bad either. Now I wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.|1
"Somehow, I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert,(Diana Pennington),""Thank You, Good Night"",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain."|1
"This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious ""In The Realm Of The Senses"", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever."|1
if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this stinkburger . do n ' t get me wrong i loooooovvveeee a lot of the characters and they all look just as good , but the main point is that the story should end there . let me explain that this film was made in 1640 by an actor called john lennon who got his first film on tv from some people in hollywood . we saw him at one of the studio reunions when he was trying to go out on his own to try and make money .|0
while this is horribly dated , i must insist . . . please , no remake ! frankly , it just wo n't work . the characters are a lot more mature than the story itself , so it has to be very old school or else they will not know that they are really doing their part . in other words , there is nothing to be done at all and the ending does not seem quite right . well , i am glad to say that this is my first attempt at an acting career as an actress . let me put it this way .|0
i am a talent manager . i have been for 15 years now . i have discovered some wonderful talent in this area . i have spent 2 decades trying to discover what i saw on my own and failed to achieve anything . i have made many mistakes and had to rewrite all of my previous works , as it was not that i wanted to make something very good , but the only things that i thought i was doing right were watching television shows and watching movies from the old days . there was never much to see or learn about any of the classic horror movies that i watched at high school .|0
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish!. Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget.|1
i just watched the dresser this evening , having only seen it once before , about a dozen years ago . it seemed to be made of wood , not wood ; there was no glass on its sides or floor , so i was guessing the whole thing had to have been made from wood . some of the parts that i see are funny , and some look horrible , but in my opinion all is good in this world . then again , if you go into a house that is as bad as your average person who does not have money to spend , how come you get a job telling people about it .|0
i can just picture how this movie came to be : ' ' so how else can we screw up our lives like this ? ' that is exactly the same thing i had planned and it made me a little nervous , but not as much as the rest of the film . on the other hand , after seeing this movie i began to get more and more excited . i found myself looking at my mother with such intensity that she was beginning to make me think that i was having an affair with my best friend , whom i had never spoken to in my entire life .|0
This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding Singer'. Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is all about metal.Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll!|1
yeah , a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction . now it ' s a prison again . you know the feeling that the whole place is being built in a bad way . well , let me put it this way : i was just like all the other locals when we first came here . i had a very good time , mainly because i didn ' t go too far from any of my favorite bars to listen to the same boring music over and over . what i love about this movie is that it reminds me of the movies i used to watch as a kid .|0
recently i borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie , which took me three sessions over three days , to get the title . it is so bad that i ca n't make heads or tails of the film . i have only seen one original in my life . if you want to know more , come to see this story and check out the sequel . you can look at all my other books in its entirety . there are not that many films in this genre . i never watched a lot of them anyway , and when i did , they would just be too much for me .|0
like margot in ` ` fear of fear ' ' falls victim of her ambitious husband , like fox in ` ` fox ' ' has the ability to change his appearance or become a real vampire . ' it is not a good idea to bring people back from the dead , if you ask me . i mean , come on , who would want to do something so evil when you have no idea how much of a chance they have against the undead ? that 's what everyone keeps telling me . then again , i am still not sure why i care , but it does n't stop me from paying attention anyway .|0
irvine welsh ' s follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh , all with an author / director / director / director / actor / producer . there is no other explanation for this novel . one of the best - looking movies i have ever seen . how does a modern movie get so old ? who cares at this point ? do you know where it goes on the internet ? if you really want to read this , you will need to see it . if you are not interested in this book , you can find it here .|0
"it ' s rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ` ` caligula ' ' surely must hold this much interest for you ' , "" i replied , looking away from the picture and into my own face . 
 "" no , it wasn ' t that . let me see this one another time , ok ? "" i put down the remote and turned to face him again . he had his back to the screen and i could barely make out his voice . "" i don ' t really like these movies , "" he said after a long pause . """|0
"i watched this film on itv and i enjoyed it a lot . it was very watchable and very funny . i think you should watch it more often . if i could go back in time , i would love to take you to the movie with me . when i saw this movie "" bad boy "" my heart did all sorts of somersaults . how could this movie possibly be good for you ? you have to come down to the lobby every morning at 4 am , make sure the security guard is sitting by his computer waiting to see your id ."|0
"Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat."|1
"in his feature film debut ` yellow , ' chris chan lee attempts to enlighten hollywood ' s portrayal of asian - americans . 
 "" i know ! i heard him tell me so . but i could n't really say what he meant . the story is pretty lame . the characters are a complete waste of time and we all know this , but i still think it would be fun to write a few episodes from my own life and see who came through . i just thought if there was some reason why a plot like this was such a bad idea that it might be useful , or interesting ."|0
i could n ' t stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime . comparisons to hitchcock are a waste of time and i got to tell you : this film is like nothing i have ever seen . how do people actually watch it ? what an idiot . i think that the story is just too bizarre to be believable . all i am saying is that i am sorry we did not have any money for such an exciting movie . i hate movies where they portray people who are guilty of committing crimes . this movie is just plain ridiculous .|0
aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat to carry such a big load . you can imagine how many women there were when he was a child - or even as young as he is now . it has been a nightmare for me . this movie , i think , is much bigger than any of the others . it does not mention one single person on the show ( but i will tell you this much : it just shows so much about the man ) , and i must say it sounds pretty bad .|0
screen treatment of the comedic broadway success ` ` the gay divorce ' ' ( a title which was considered too scandalous to be made up by actors , writers , or readers ) is based on a documentary written in the early 1920s . this film was very different from that of the other shows and films i knew . it was more like a joke at the end of the movie . some critics said that the producers had a sense of humor . i found this to be a bit funny but i thought we all had our good days .|0
It's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. The paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly came to know it, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. I've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways.|1
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. I suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.But putting that aside, I found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead Vincent Spano.I have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies I missed during that decade.|1
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000).|1
"my yardstick for measuring a movie ' s watch - ability is if i get squirmy . if i start shifting positions and making things move too quickly it 's all over before you can say , ' okay ' . "" she had her hands in her jacket pockets to warm them up as she continued , "" this film may have been written at some point during the first week of our relationship , but that did n't stop it from becoming a bigger mess by the time the movie ended . we were getting quite close to breaking up when i received this letter from a client ."|0
this is an excellent , little known movie . tom selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie . it really was one of my favorite films when i was younger and i had to pay $ 1 million to have it released . i can not remember the name of the actress on the film because her name is not recognizable . at the same time , i can not recall the date of her death or why she would have wanted to kill herself . there seems to be something going on with that movie and i ca n't figure out what it is .|0
as i sit back after watching wong kar - wai ' s 1994 movie ashes of time more specifically the 2008 re - edit , i thought it was funny . there were some pretty funny scenes and in the end , the plot turned out to be quite hilarious . if you want to know what makes the story tick , look at this movie . a man comes to a huge warehouse on a deserted beach with an empty boat . he finds a woman he has n't seen for several years and decides to try and make her his wife .|0
"just watched hair after a lapse of 20 years . it struck home . for those of us who tried too hard , the idea of letting go of the old ways became an impossibility . if we are to continue as i am and live at the ranch , then you should not put up with what they do ! i could never be happy here , so i decided to start living somewhere else . one day i found myself outside on the gravel road watching a big suv pull away from the driveway .

if you decide to watch wild rebels , do n ' t expect anything deep and meaningful . if you ' re looking for a romance novel , i ' m sure there is so much more to this book that we can get out of here . one of these days you may be watching an action movie and will never know what they were doing . oh ! but the characters are good . all of my other reviews are bad . it ' s just not fair . i mean , it ' s so scary that it makes your teeth hurt .|0
fans of euro - horror flicks - portland ' s video / dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - all it needs is some more action , but not quite enough , especially if you think about it in the end . let me help you understand that these films are completely self - fulfilling and utterly useless , while the premise here seems perfectly normal , just like everything else in this movie . however , they have one major flaw : ( 1 ) the characters are never as good as they seem .|0
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really wish I had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh.|1
this cheapo remake of the terrific five star final suffers from terrible acting . humphrey bogart stars as the manager of the film , yet he seems to be just another guy trying to do his job . i want to read a lot about him and his movie , but really all i can see is that it ' s not good at all . humphrey bogart ' s stories are too simple and uninteresting for my tastes . if you wanted to take a long - standing relationship to the point of making an art career out of it , there was nothing much to see around these parts .|0
"wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long - standing no - trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan , but what happens when they go out to lunch and do not see anyone from their town ? "" i 'm so afraid this is going to be a very boring movie ( it should get better ! ) . at least that would explain why i 've seen most of it on television . i was trying to decide which one i liked better . i got a good job with the film company and saw some real interesting stuff , so i wanted to watch this movie and learn more about myself ."|0
for a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ` ` rosemarys baby ' ' is one big joke . you get used to seeing this movie when you pay it a lot of money to watch with your friend . even if the plot is awful , at least it gets you to laugh . like most comedic movies , it 's not really funny or believable . i am not going to judge this movie because it has absolutely nothing in it about what happened in 1912 . the main character was an old gentleman who had been working in a coal mine during the winter of 1814 .|0
i really do n ' t know much about the marquis de sade , not having read any of his book , except for the fact he is very old , and has written a number of films which appear in a lot of films . this one was the best one i have ever watched . actually i never saw anything like this , but you will have to look it up when you come across it on goodreads . i am going to show you something else , but first i will introduce you to my most important film that i have just recently been inspired to do .|0
"It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. This movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. The box lies, this is no ""erotic thriller"", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. This movie fails in pretty much every way."|1
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. Canada becomes part of the USA. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the USA. Silly me. Continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South have to be among the most imaginative series ever.|1
i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted . its a movie that greatly surpasses other films of the genre , if you can believe it ; not one of those things that make it sound easy to read in any of the movies that i have ever seen . the plot does not go anywhere near the storyline . it is far too short . i know this because we are on the same page about this thing . i think there are some bad parts , like the scene where these guys try to rape a woman out in the woods and she tells them they have no rights .|0
"yep , it ' s me again ! mr ' i sit through crap so you do n ' t have to ' . what do they call them anyway ? "" his voice dropped an octave . "" hey , did you say something ? "" he asked looking in the mirror as if someone had told him there was a ghost here and wanted to watch the film . i just shrugged my shoulders . "" what is it ? "" i said trying not to laugh . 
 "" nothing really . i was just trying to look at a movie that might have a nice cast ."|0
I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed.One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J.|1
i ' ve tried watching it twice , though i have n ' t been able to make through either episode . for one thing , we don ' t see much that makes us feel as if we are in control of our own destiny . there are a few things i would say about the role of this movie - the characters , the plot , the characters , the scenes , the location of places , the content , the audience , and most important , the ending . some people believe that the title is not quite right , but you just don ' t watch this movie unless you really love it .|0
I must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of Camp Blood.Camp Blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.The DVD was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.Don't do what I did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.|1
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a '1'?I thought ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything COULD be worse.I was wrong. ""Galaxina"" is that rare movie where EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented, ""Who the hell LIT this thing?"" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . ."|1
Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the very northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings.|1
this film hits the heart with a reality like no other i have seen . it shows what us what is really inside out . and when we see some good comedies that are funny , we think : how can this be ? if this movie does n't go to the top than where did it come from ? why would it even get to the top ? as for the plot , the whole point of this movie is not to create an image of a successful writer . you just need to give your mind another day or two to wake up and tell me what is going on .|0
( contains really bad spoilers ) so what can i say about this . . . . it ' s a really horrible and uninspiring story . it shows no respect for the people who were killed or murdered by their enemies . i had seen too much horror in the last few centuries to be surprised by that sort of show . if you want to know something , you should watch the movies . there is certainly not much good stuff in this movie but it is still pretty funny . after watching all of the scary things that went on throughout the movie , i got the feeling that this was an easy shot .|0
A lot of 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents... stuff fell into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing.|1
this movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers . he also loves his mommy . he and she are just so cute ! the movie starts out as a comedy with two actors and an actress working together to make it seem like the acting is n't bad . well , i have seen many of these movies and there has not been a lot of them ( except for one ) , but they have been a bunch of jerks . the funniest part was the story that comes from the movie itself .|0
walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years . the script for james joyce is based off of this novel . what if the story is about how a young boy meets his mother ? i mean , if you do get to see a movie where your parents are married and have kids , you should see that the only thing different about them being single is their sex life . i am sure the plot is slightly more believable than it could ever be . but , i had not seen any movies like this in recent weeks .|0
Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but lack Ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. When Mondo Burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like Good Burger is history, until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door.|1
this is a haunting short film . both james franco and rachel miner deliver performances that hurt , ring true and make their fans cry as if they have died . i read the book and thought it was quite intriguing . but i can not figure out why they went through this trouble to publish it . maybe they were trying to scare me away . however , i must say it is really interesting . it has been in my repertoire for over 2 , 000 years . what am i going to write about this movie then ? i just ca n't imagine myself doing any good with anything else on paper .|0
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen. The visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent Black and White to Color switch. I also thought that The story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clichéd Action Movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do.|1
"honestly , on the subject of the death penalty , i could take it or leave it . the problem is that you should know what happens when you pass judgment on a human in this country . if he has been judged as one of them , so should everyone else .

"" john was beginning to lose control . he just needed to give himself some time to think about things . he looked around the room for somewhere to go , but none of the men seemed to be having any luck ."|0
"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his ""wedding."" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The ""joke"" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his ""bits and pieces."""|1
a man kicks a dog 2 ' in the air . a woman kicks a cow out of her bed . a man kicks a tree with his bare hands because he does not want to win any prizes for that one . what an awful comedy . when i saw this , i realized how bad it was and i made fun of my mother again . she told me to turn off the tv and let her have it back as soon as i got home from school . i thought it would go away , but it has continued to torment me throughout this movie .|0
this week ' s surprise screening at gv turned out to be the horror movie the nun ( la monja ) wanted to watch . i am sure it was not just for entertainment , but because they are in love and have n't seen or heard from each other in decades . the first episode started out with a cute young girl trying to hide behind her friend 's shoulder . instead , she tries to get away from someone . the guy tries to hug her but fails miserably as the girl tries to get away while being pursued by two men on a motorcycle .|0
"I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on back about ""an overzealous, evangelical Christian do-gooder,"" and identifying as an evangelical Christian, myself, I thought, ""Ooohthis should be interesting."" And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough, all too familiar."|1
"There is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: ""In Italy it's the dead who rule"". True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. But foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed."|1
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered up to standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and, the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to he girl, so guess what?! Then the final after-twist I do not know what to think of that.|1
If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated.|1
A few yrs ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that Rozzie R. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'.Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading.|1
This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (the Sandy Dennis character) apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis.|1
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic.|1
Okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *SPOILER ALERT* The film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is so very.) Now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough.|1
"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen either the early 80's ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"" or the mid 90's ""The Stepford Husbands"", but this ""The Stepford Children"" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. It's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree."|1
"I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow, I've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up very much into punk rock, and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. Not every punk song incorporates ""Oi!"" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion."|1
first of all , i have nothing against christianity . i believe , every person has the right to believe what he or she is told . however , when it comes down to that point , there is no telling whether any of those people will be able to stand up and live a reasonably healthy life , let alone make a proper decision about their own lives . perhaps we should ask the most important question : can they really do this without being completely nuts ? how are you going to stop them doing something if they do n't even realize exactly what they are doing ?|0
"saw this at the hong kong international film festival , over three years ago . i went in with no idea who ' ve got their hands all over this film , it was a mess . i just know they are going to throw it out of line . i found out what is going on between these two and have a feeling they will destroy this film once and for all if they do not watch it . that "" s one thing about films that you should never let get you down ; they make people act out every single second ."|0
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon.|1
"The reviewer in Variety said this was ""overwritten and overlong"", and I kind of agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the US in kind of an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970's ""guy must find meaning in his life"" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal."|1
"Like the above poster, I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha... This movie is everything the above poster said and worse... Poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...There was very little here that was even worth watching... How this movie even got released is beyond me. Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.The movie I bought was labeled ""Piranha"" and not ""Piranha, Piranha!"" which is what it actually is... This is the only way they sold this movie at all.Peace Out."|1
if you ' re in the middle of a ferocious war and it ' s still not clear that you ' re going to die . i thought you might have something good to say . so here it is . what do you wanna do with yourself ? well , i didn ' t really want to talk about it , but it ' s hard to say no to someone who actually knows what they are doing . most of these people just know how to tell me how to act as an ordinary person . they ' re supposed to teach me all sorts of interesting things - or try their best at it .|0
"This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.She is far better here than she was in ""The Out of Towners"". The material, I will admit, is beneath the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.As long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do."|1
i had to get this movie , since it did n ' t come to where i live . i waited patiently for a bit and got bored of waiting . i could n't wait to be on the show again - i wanted to know if that was really the only way to get an interview . i went out and bought two movies ( which were pretty cheap ) and then sat there looking at them . they were good , but not as good as the previous shows . they were just as bad . i remember seeing some funny stuff in one of the videos , so i decided to watch it again .|0
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. The acting was OK but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.What bothered me the most about this film was the Celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. The directing and continuity was pretty bad too! **SPOILER** For example, after Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio.|1
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots.|1
i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love . in fact , it makes sex so much easier . you get to watch it with people at the end , and your heart goes out to each and every one of them , and you will be surprised how many of them turn out like me . there are a lot of good - looking guys ; some of them have a great body , but others look more like they just walked off the cover of a book . most of them are too drunk to know what the hell they are talking about .|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. There is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. Zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. I was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! .............Don't expect anything from this movie.|1
i have no qualms with how the movie does not capture new jersey ( like zach , i ' m from a town in the united states ) . as my mom always says , love is a funny thing to say , but for some reason it feels wrong . why ca n't we all live in harmony ? what would it be like to live together in harmony ? it is so unfair ! why could anyone stand to spend time with this kind of crap ? well , it just was not worth it . unfortunately , if you ever want to have fun and enjoy life again , look at the big picture here .|0
"Don't get me wrong. I've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to ""Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys"" sticks a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun, ""Head Of The Family"" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W."|1
i ' ve seen all 3 now . i just ca n ' t believe how bad naqoyqatsi is . not in comparison to most japanese films , but they ' re worse than i expected . even the actors have a terrible sense of humour on film and it seems like they should have spent an eternity editing their characters . well , you see , the movie was really lousy and the worst parts were so awful that you could ' t write a decent script . after seeing the first three episodes , there are two problems : one , it was hard to make out any plot lines from the end .|0
story of a strange love and a fall desire . poem about beauty and his perfection , fear and touch . a movie that should never have been made to begin with . but now , in this book , i can barely contain the excitement of what i am looking at . so far , it does n't seem to bother any of us as much as it probably should , which is good . however , the plot is very vague , not quite like what you may imagine from a film . the first couple of weeks were all pretty boring , except for the occasional little bit of interesting stuff .|0
this is the ultimate kung fu movie ! this is the only kung fu movie ! this is the only movie i was watching at that point , except for a few of them , of course . if you have n't seen this one by chance then you do n't know what kind of film this is supposed to be . it is a series of episodes that will end with the deaths of two young women who were kidnapped and left in the middle of a lake . there has to be a better way to make the movie play out than by watching it on youtube .|0
san franpyscho : 1 out of 10 : so you want to make a serial killer movie . but your movies are n't really that different from any other movie , except for the film itself . it 's just not my way . this was an especially bad movie and i wish they would all shut up and pay attention to it because if they did n't then i 'd take a picture of it every time i saw it . but no such luck . i watched the entire series in the living room and never got tired of it .|0
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. There is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. Our actress are treated like pieces of ass, and seem to be perfectly happy with their position. The lead characters, these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.|1
i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the sequel . there is always hope for a sequel to the series , if you do not believe the premise or characters . i found it hard to keep track of what i read in all the books . so far , i have not had more than 20 minutes of my time . however , at first , i was hoping for another 10 minutes . but since i have no money when it comes to movies and other things , i decided to leave it alone .|0
if there are people that do n ' t like this movie , i do n ' t think they are human . this movie can be really boring and has to be a lot of fun but you ca n't see anyone actually enjoy it as much as you think they do . we are all very fond of the actor who did the plot so badly that we found a way to let him keep on acting for what seemed like most of the year . the only thing that gives him away was the fact that after the movie he would not change anything about himself .|0
"I unwittingly walked into this ""trap"" of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a refund I would be happy.It was 7:30pm and Cinderella Man didn't start until 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and I dare say God reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing."|1
"A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this ""masterpiece"" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. ""The number one comedy in America"" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over."|1
this movie is simply bad . first of all the story is just weird and it ' s not good written , so it ' s not very funny . but there is a whole series of other movies as well to keep you interested ( which i can ' t see how that can be true ) . also , i really didn ' t want to spend my day in this place on an endless list of boring things . i was disappointed when i realized that i didn ' t get much fun about the film . i ' m glad that the rest of the movie was uneventful .|0
This movie was terrible. You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain films combined. To start, the acting was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.|1
i love umberto lenzi ' s cop movies - - rome armed to the teeth is my favorite - - and his desert island series , which are a lot like mine in every way . if you want this story , you will need to start at the beginning . what was i thinking ? i should have been paying attention , not running around in circles trying to find out everything that went on in the movie . this is such a bad time to look back . i spent a few minutes looking for the first part of this movie .|0
i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out . just one more bad example of it being the worst movie ever created . that movie was probably the worst one i 've ever seen . the characters were so pathetic , they looked like caricature of what you expect to see when viewed from a human perspective . even though it was n't really good , there is no way that we did not laugh at the entire situation . i remember feeling ashamed because i could feel my face getting warm .|0
"Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's bad enough I wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time I lost that I could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually lost a few IQ points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing ""work""! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time."|1
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas, the roistering, free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries.|1
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look.|1
Wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life.|1
"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.It had potential."|1
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so forth. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic.|1
"this movie reeks . no money , no acting , no nothing . i caught this on on the 3am news and asked her why she did it . 
 "" i got in trouble for something when i was nine , "" she says . "" my dad had some friends go to the movies , but that was a waste of time because they only saw half the show . so what happened ? he just started screaming about how we all have to put together an image of myself as a big shot , and he ended up killing one of our friends ."|0
I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc.|1
"I love this movie. At first, I didn't expect much of this movie since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (I've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since I saw ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should've played Minnie's part and vice versa."|1
This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. A must see for all who like Indie and for those who don't. I think this movie will draw more into the Indie scene. The acting was top notch! The character of Alice was portreyed so well. With perfect akwardness. This movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! I think it would do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is untouched by the Hollywood hand.|1
this series is formulaic and boring . the episodes are the same thing every week , simply with slightly varied plot twists . but this one does n't . it feels so much like a story to me . i am intrigued by the characters . most of the scenes were good , even when they were in the original . but there was a huge flaw in the plot and the plot began to take a different twist as each person tried to come up with some way to save themselves from being dragged off to be experimented on . no matter what happens , you can not stop the madness that encircles you .|0
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fast forward was I able to make it through the first 2 hours. The write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but I didn't see much of either. If it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt that I will watch the rest without a recommendation.This review is supposed to be without spoilers so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic.|1
Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed one bit. He is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. This time he has a pal named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end.|1
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? Only hope this is first and the last as well, for God's sake ! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. Why does Himesh not smile ?|1
"this is horrible film. it is past dumb. first, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in 7th grade. not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being pretty and popular is not everything. but that is what the twins make it out to be. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to France. He has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two ""cute french boys"" with motorcycles."|1
this movie is certainly well - constructed , beginning and ending in the dark , with focus on lili smith / schmidt , a female model who had fallen head over heels in love with her ex - husband . but she could have done so much more about what was going on behind the scenes , especially if she had been there herself to see it . i still ca n't believe how quickly they turned around and pretended to go back into their homes , leaving the entire world to follow suit . that movie would be a waste of a million years ' worth of people ' s hard work .|0
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting, there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.Anyway...I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it.|1
i was looking forward to dante ' s contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime , but this was nothing like the original . there were not enough characters for it to have a plot line or even seem believable . in any case , the story is not very good and the plot does n't fit as well as i had hoped . what do you make of the story ? i am sure you are thinking how much fun this one would be , but it has been a while since i have gone to the theatre .|0
this film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and lonely movie . the lead character has no idea what is happening behind the scenes , i mean really , it could be worse ! in this movie , the bad guy wins because there just are n't any other characters to win the game . at least there was some kind of dialogue when the script was set up . however , the actors are quite poor . i do not know how many things have changed since i have been on tv . most of the actors are still mediocre .|0
"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin."|1
this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time - in australia , as long as a couple years ago . i was not the only one on that film who did n't watch the movie . if you have seen it before , you will know why . well , it is the first thing that occurs to me and i can see why it would be so interesting . there is absolutely nothing of importance going on in this movie but what i do notice is how they are both being portrayed as real people . each character is acting just like the others .|0
"The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my ""tilt switch"" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had."|1
wait until you ' ve watched most of all other films ever released , wait a year , then watch this one in which it was made to last another three years . but it ' s too hard to read how the characters go from bad to worse . i just hope you like this book and can understand it . if you are interested in hearing about the story , please take a few minutes to write a review of this movie . i think it is really good . even though the premise is stupid and the plot is pathetic , the dialogue is fun .|0
"And so it started with ""Shreik"" a send up of horror films, then we had Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: Scary Movie* Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4* Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....Super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny."|1
"This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. I've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. This isn't it. The ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.Here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.1) A posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname ""the brick"". 3) A couple that shag too loudly."|1
based on the comments made so far , everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . i do n't even really understand how a bunch of people who know nothing about real - world travel ( and all of its details ) can enjoy this one as long as they ' re actors instead of actors . it ' s just plain terrible . not a good movie at all . you ' ll be disappointed when we finally get out of here . the plot is abysmal from the beginning . the character is stupid , with bad timing and too much acting .|0
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. The acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative.I would pay good money never, ever to see it again. Because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for anything really important.|1
it ' s astonishing that some people saw this as art . we saw it as a poorly filmed ( shaky ) horror film in which someone was shot in the head and then the other person did it . this one was so badly staged , i ' ll never get my movie to sell . the only thing that i can figure out is who shot the film . they just could not see it because no one has seen it in over a year . i have to admit , i ca ' t understand why they would want to film it on tv .|0
"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a ""thriller"" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish ""starting"". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of ""No Country for Old Men"" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters."|1
a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those small theaters where there are only two people who really know anything about movie selection . it 's funny how many people do n't even know that they have to watch these films for a living . i would love to see such things , but i just never had the courage to get into it . well , this movie is great , but no one really knows why the actors left the movies out and did not try to figure out what was so interesting about them before they died .|0
"Without doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of ""AAA"" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, ""G"" rated family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the ""GRAND CHAMPION"" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, JULIA."|1
this was a great movie . something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of human life in the nineteenth century . i enjoyed it even though i really should have gotten rid of it because it is an ugly film that has no real depth and does not give a decent sense of humor . the plot is very depressing and the characters seem rather stupid . i ca n't get past the fact that we are all made up of so many awful things . i do n't know why i did it . i just kind of lost my mind at first .|0
i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself . . . am i going to be a part in this movie , or am i going to enjoy it ? what will it be like when i leave ? if it is my last time seeing this movie , then i know that i would miss it . i thought that i could do well as a journalist , but perhaps this was a waste of time . let me make it clear ; this movie is not one of my favorites .|0
"we get to see who the good guys are . the union . and who the bad guys are , of course . what 's the connection ? "" she did n't answer immediately and then answered : "" i guess it 's all a series of things . the only thing that makes sense about this show is that it was made during a time when people were living in their own little paradise . how can they afford to live out there after so much time away from home ? this show should have been in its early 30s or early 30s , maybe even 80s ."|0
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story.|1
Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place.|1
i tried . i really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a movie by stephen king . the first book i wrote was an amazing story about a girl who lives in australia and finds out her mom has a drug problem because her dad is so much older than he is . when i got to know this girl 's parents , they were just as good as they are scary . she lived with her parents for over two years and finally decided to get away . it was not quite a happy goodbye , but it was close .|0
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early 'X-Files' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first ""rockin'"" episodes. It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature ""The Thing"", and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers."|1
this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to . it started out that people wanted to meet their parents , but they were forced to do it by their relatives . the only reason we got to see the movie was because we were invited . you should read a lot of great films , but it never happens as a whole - it just ends in disaster and horror . there are thousands of them , and each one is more horrifying than the last . this movie is absolutely terrible .|0
Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad things are:1. It's very slow. 2. How Ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of Asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home.|1
i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing , but i just found it annoying . it ' s hard to find someone in this story who likes the old movie better than the one that 's been filmed . there were some really cool people at work , a guy with a nice smile , a girl of about his age , and a man who looks pretty much like himself , but has a lot more money and is always wearing nicer clothes . most of the characters are boring . the only thing worth noting here is the plot .|0
Here's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man.Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep.|1
i caught this movie late night on tv , and was expecting a low - budget campy ` ` masterpiece ' ' , i did n't really watch the movie very long . it is a fairly boring one , mostly because i have to pretend to be asleep during it . i actually got bored at the start and thought it would take me all of half an hour to realize that i was just dreaming . after watching it for almost thirty minutes i was starting to feel like i was being chased by bandits . my mind started working overtime trying to make sense out of everything that happened over the last couple of hours .|0
from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values , but still look like bad art to me . let me show you something : i do n't think any of the movies were original . the best thing about the movie and its characters is that all the details are too short for anyone to get to the plot . the acting is terrible , and the lighting is horrible . the dialogue is poor . even the soundtrack seems to be mediocre . everything was so poorly written that there is no point in trying to find humor in the script at all .|0
"Even if you're not a ""theatre person,"" I highly recommend that you see this. Based off of a play of the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing-- by far Sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna."|1
with a name like ` ` 10 commandments ' ' you would expect a film to be representative of the account in which this film is written . it 's just not . there is no story that goes on between the two people . i ca n't even find another title for this movie . it has never been mentioned before , but it is definitely a comedy . one thing i know is that i really do not understand this plot . where are they both ? who are we expecting to see tomorrow ? what are their plans ?|0
there ' s a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre being turned into a mess of cliches by some people . i don ' t see what the harm in it , since no one is actually doing anything wrong and they can ' t hurt anyone . i mean , as a kid i saw this movie on cable and was very interested in the characters . but now i realize that it didn ' t make much sense to me at all ! the film was just a waste of money and money . if i had known i would have put it in its proper box .|0
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly.|1
Before I start to tear apart this movie, mark you--I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So, I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film.To my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises.|1
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it.|1
it seems on the surface to be a romantic _ planes , trains and automobiles _ but at times tried for something more sinister . there are too many contradictions , too much about this character that is really just an ordinary person trying to get his or her head out of his shoulders . i am not particularly interested in this story itself , so i would like to stop you here . however , before i start reading , please consider one other thing , namely , what happened to my wife ? why has she gone crazy all of a sudden ? do you see where this is going ?|0
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.|1
a lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help . to young to be on his own the cat is a terrible waste of time , he can only go along for the ride and i would like to think that if i had not done this job i would not be doing this at all . as soon as i finished reading this story , i got so bored with my book that i picked it up right off the street and went back to reading . you see , i did n't want to look at the other stories because i wanted to take a moment to enjoy the story itself .|0
brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . their alluring visual effect is actually pretty cute . it is the best thing to happen to them in the last decade of filming . i just hope that this movie is well done . as soon as the lights are on and the camera sets up , i want to ask some questions . first off , can i ask you a personal question ? i know that you have never had an adult film like this or television . please let me start at the beginning .|0
if this film had been directed by dw griffith or stanley kubrick , it would be recognized for what it was : a comedy . the characters were very dull and the jokes were awful . there was an unfunny plot line , but then the bad parts did not really exist , which was why i like this show best of all . one of the things i enjoyed about being a producer is the lack of time to go back and do anything more creative with it . while you may not think so , your reviews were very helpful . this movie is as good as anything you will ever watch .|0
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well. Compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. The plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which I cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture.|1
leni riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda moore tries to call ` ` humor ' ' . that this movie is funny shows how naïve he was , and how little he has been able to do in his day . but what can i say ? moore has a lot of talent , and he is smart and ambitious . he is one of my best critics . when i first saw this show , it appeared as an odd comedy with lots of weird twists and turns . i did n't have a good time reading it because it lacked much humor .|0
this film could have been great - but was n ' t . amongst the cesspool of talentless no - hopers and friends of the poor , that movie was a real disappointment . if you are reading this in order to enjoy it ( and i would not blame you ) then perhaps you do n't want to read this ; for the moment , i am quite happy watching what is being said about the film . as you will find out at this end , there is something really bad coming up . however , unlike the first two times , this story is very entertaining .|0
* * * spoilers * * * this movie - called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst sequel i have written . it starts with a bad ending which has no redeeming qualities , or an entertaining ending at all . for some reason the plot just is n't enough to be worthy of mentioning . it just does n't seem to make sense . not one single thing about this film makes any sense . i know that most of the actors are actors and directors , but i never thought that these characters would be anything like these guys .|0
"a bit ` ` the movie in the movie ' ' case , or as the theme is virtual game here , ' "" he pointed to his chest .

"If you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (I guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! The plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the ""actors"" can sleep at night! It's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and I highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something."|1
There are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. It's always good to remember, that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god.|1
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. Thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare I say....jolly good cinema. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood.|1
after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films of all sorts , so it is one of the best movies i can ever remember seeing . i think you might be surprised to know how many more movies i saw on this particular film than the first ones . when i was in high school and watching this movie once , i realized that i loved this movie . the main character from the movie looked like an evil villain with his hands tied behind his back and a moustache hanging out as if someone wanted to pull it out while laughing at something else .|0
"One of the commenter's is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the ""Electric Chair"" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn't help matters."|1
I watched this movie with big expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.Sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations.|1
"this noisy , dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well , me included - and is so intense . i 've always loved it when my friends go out with their girlfriends just to watch some stupid movie about a girl who does n't know her own name or where she wants to go . i ca n't understand why anyone would want to be seen with a guy like him . if they were going out with a girl like that , they would at least have an interesting story line ( "" how long have you been seeing him ?

"Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. The one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the IMDb.I found ""What Alice Found"" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that I have seen this year. It's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing?"|1
I watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of Beth being the younger sister, and making Amy the 3rd one. And Jo interpretation, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying Jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl.|1
Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago the parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried.|1
"the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy . it ' s hardly a comedy , it ' s not funny at all . it ' s a video made by a couple who ' ve had a bad week and want nothing better to do after having so much fun on the job . some of the people that i ' ve seen with this film don ' t take the time to read the title titles . i hope you enjoy the movie , it was great , if you "" ll give me a break . i ' ve only seen more films in my life ."|0
hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test to date . and for example , if a man can not even get a good night 's sleep ( at least when it comes to sex ) , then where do you take a woman that is about as sexy as a guy ? the only reason she is in this country at all is that she is the queen of england and has the most beautiful wife in the world - except maybe for alice in wonderland .|0
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. Then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV EVER -- I think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl.|1
I recently rented this promising mini series, I didn't even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.Forsyth deserves much, much better than this.|1
The animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After having watched Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. But they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.Otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. I always like hearing the silly voice-overs. They never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of weird looking bugs were cool too.|1
"how can anybody give this anything higher than a ' 1 ' ? i thought ` ` manos , the hands of god ' would be the best movie i 've seen . "" "" it should be an interesting film , "" steve said , thinking about what had just happened to him that night . "" i did n't think they were going to make it any better , but i guess they have no choice . "" "" do you really believe there is something else in there ? "" asked ryan . 
 "" sure , why not . there are thousands of movies like this one being made with the same premise ."|0
i am writing this review simply because i am a huge fan of the book , prozac nation , and that stupid film . however , i want to note that while it may have some good humor , it can also take your breath away . in many places , most of the reviews were so lame as to be comical . one of the most amusing parts was the way you guys made it look like you had all three of us at the same time . there was no such thing as too much laughter , or too little emotion whatsoever .|0
This was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless.|1
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage, I have stumbled across this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. Its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right. I was in love immediately. Then, a funny thing happened about the second time around. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie.Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That's very commendable.|1
the films use of blue - black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir - ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not . while i would be willing to bet that the quality is bad , i can tell that it was not made in real life . on the plus side ( at least i guess ) there are a lot of positive reviews about the film and some good comments regarding the character . so why ca n't you get a decent film ? i am starting to understand why people go into horror movies in their spare time . they are too busy getting out of trouble .|0
This movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning Minnie Driver's character. I think that all too often Hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too.|1
as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch . too unreal to even consider . the plot is an unconvincing one and the film has no substance . so i decided to just see what they were trying to achieve at the expense of their own egos . there are some bad jokes about the game , but you know we should have kept our noses out of the game in the first place when we bought this book . well , if you 're looking for a classic story or something like that maybe you could go through me instead .|0
Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Source's personal assassin, Shax. Whilst Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper, and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done.|1
well , i fear that my review of this special wo n ' t heed much different observation than the others before it . while i can not understand why it is that women have to be so difficult to please . there has to be at least one female who is as stubborn as their male counterparts . in fact , most of the women on the film appear to be able to do things they would not otherwise . i am trying to get a sense of how these movie scenes play out ( which i can not quite do , for i am too young and inexperienced to understand all the other issues involved ) .|0
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.What it's principally lacking is charm.|1
"Comedy? What's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time I turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? Set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. Served up with lashings of Hollywood's religious ""God will Save you"" redemption drivel Another Reviewer mentioned the ""Sassy dialogue"" of Tea Leone - well I managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and I still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than Tea's character in this rubbish."|1
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. There are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? Not at all, is my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with a failure like this.|1
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason.|1
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, loyal retainer Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are sheltered by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek vengeance against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die.|1
frederick forsyth ' s books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise to anyone who is not looking for it . i hope you will enjoy this movie . i am not a very good reader and thought it was a waste of my time , and if i do n't read it then i do n't know what i would do now . as far as the reviews of the movies going on in this genre , i have to say these are some of the most well - made horror films i have ever seen .|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared being oddly camp. Raised many laughs but also many yawns. don't watch with anyone, anytime any place. If u hate someone, recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant...not. i cant think of anything else to say except Don't ever see this movie, it will make u want to jump off a cliff.|1
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on IMDb, I'll leave this comment here.Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film.|1
"it ' s hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . the dialog was unnatural . what is wrong with this movie ? why are people so stupid when they do this stuff ? how can they just write something like this in their own script ? i am not even going to think about this part , for fear of giving you an example . let me continue : 
 http : // www.eyescryode.org / 
 1 . every film that ever came from this movie has no name , no real personality , nothing special about it ."|0
"a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this . my favorite was the part where the girl gets murdered on stage , which is pretty bad , except that there really is nothing scary about the movie . the guy 's name is billy johnson , and he is obviously not a villain . however , if anyone ever asks you ' are you a true villain ' why do n't you just answer ? when i asked billy johnson how his story was made from this , he just put his hands above his head and said , "" oh , it was awful . """|0
"So, this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It's up there with ""Crossbones"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares!"|1
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great.|1
"You thought after ""Traumschiff Surprise"" that German comedy can't get worse? It can. This comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... The real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men."|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl.|1
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title ""Acrobatty Bunny"", it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that, it's quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in ""Big Top Bunny""."|1
"i saw this at my in - laws ' house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother - in - law said , "" the only person who could be more evil than this is you . "" "" how can you love me ? "" i thought . what do i think ? what are the chances of a plot with a happy ending ? we all have our roles to play , we just have to know which one is better . the bad guys have to be destroyed before they can get to their goal , and that usually includes me ."|0
this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen . i ' ve spent four years at an amusement park , being watched as if by a group of clowns , and was watching every single episode for the first half hour with no luck . i ' ve seen it again and again on the television , so i could tell you about some of the things that happen . one of which was me getting shot in the face by a very fat guy who actually had my boobs hanging out in the movie . i thought they were too bad , when they showed it on the radio .|0
this movie is so bad , they would n ' t buy it back at my local used cd / dvd store . i think i was more scared of getting stuck with an oscar than anything in the movie . not that there are millions of other stars or even enough actors to make one a good movie , but i don ' t want to get stuck in the first place . if i had to pick one of those movies , i would choose this movie because it would be a cinematographic comedy where the actors are trying to find some reason to kill themselves for the life of their creator .|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie. The only problem is it isn't very well done.My brain is still insulted from the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala The Weather Channels commercials. Why would watching local news footage of a washed out side-street give insight to global weather patterns? You got me.Also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man.|1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices.|1
as a fan of author gipharts lightheaded and humorous books ( of which ik ook van jou is not the only man who wrote this series ) . in fact he is one of the greatest men on earth , having won the award for the most romantic comedy ever written . i have no doubt if i was reading this , i would have done the same thing with my son . although i do not believe that much of this has ever happened , it does have some great plot twists that make it seem to me that there is more to this movie than met the eye .|0
this is a piece of cinematic beauty , and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other movies i have seen . one night , i woke up in the dark , trying not to sleep . i had just gotten back from a camping trip with another friend ; he had rented a small tent on an island and was driving off with some girl . i stayed in the tent because it was still cold . the sky was gray with clouds and the air was chilly . i thought i heard a noise outside .|0
Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. Upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better film than,The 6th Sense(8.2), Saving Private Ryan(8.4), Lord of the Rings( 8.7),Godfather(9.5), Gladiator(8.1) and Dawn of the Dead ( 7.8) to name a few.|1
"this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people , two of whom join the naxalite movement and blah blah blah . "" "" wait a minute , how would you know all of these stuff if you ' ve never seen it before ? "" asked planner . 
 "" yes , i don ' t even know where to start . let me first say i ' ve been in this business for twenty - eight years . so i ' m really surprised when we see an old man trying to be a great journalist ; he looks more like a teenage boy trying to get a better job ."|0
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role.|1
foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous , disfigured gypsy . the prey dies and the monster is freed . i have seen the films on the tv at least once , and i have seen them all . but even though this movie has no real plot , as you can see , i would not recommend making this movie . the ending was horrible , just plain awful . however , the characters are very believable and interesting to watch . they play out their whole lives in what appears to be a great film of epic proportions .|0
mankind ' s self awakening is the theme of ` ` 2001 : a space odyssey ' ' , a process that unfolds as a matter of course . the plot and character are quite simple ; there is just one point in it which makes you wonder why they took this movie so well . the story is really good , the characters are entertaining and the audience loves them ! the plot is pretty boring and the characters are absolutely ridiculous . the fact that most people like this movie do not want to take it personally is a bit of a blow .|0
i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me , and we both had the same ideas . it was terrible . the script was just awful . i think i may have been on the right track in this film . actually , i was thinking more about how to save my own life than what was happening in the movie itself . you know , when i went back to my apartment last night to change into my black robe , all that light from the outside was out . so i put on some music and listened to this movie .|0
i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv , even though i was n't looking forward to seeing that stupid movie . a few years ago i had seen this movie on the big screen in new orleans . it was a great idea for me to watch it at one of my favourite restaurants in los angeles . what could happen ? if i did not like it , there were some bad characters that i thought would go along with it so i left it alone and went to an internet cafe where i began to watch it on my kindle .|0
maybe it was the fact that i saw spider - man the day before i saw duces wild , but i do n't remember what it was . and i did n't tell my parents . they would have wanted me to tell them . i do n't know why he is dead . it is so horrible . i hate the idea of not seeing him for the rest of my life . i like having him in the house on a sunday morning , but i really do n't care about his death or what happens in it . i like to watch television and read while i wait at the post office .|0
"If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the ""bad grrl"" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved."|1
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting locales, great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one.Sadly, Andrew Keir has passed on & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series many times yet a DVD release is yet to happen.The series is one which is timeless. It is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day.|1
to put it simply , this was a pompous piece of canine poopie . overly stagey and everyone being the worst person in the whole world , it was funny when you laughed at them and watched them laugh . but this was one of the worst laughs i 'd ever had . i would have thought that we would be able to go on forever if anyone had bothered to send us any kind of warning or anything . instead , we sat in a quiet little library , staring blankly into space like kids trying to figure out how they are going to get rid of their homework so they can finish school .|0
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. This is, without peer, the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. I had nightmares of this movie ever since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. The film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived from).|1
i remember seeing a clip of this movie on hbo when i was a kid and it scared the ever - living tar out of me , but it is one of the best movies of my life . it shows the characters in their worst moment ; they get upset with each other and then they have to stop and calm down . the main feature is the whole ' love child ' scene . we all watch this movie and some people even laugh . it is funny how you can do nothing except laugh like an idiot for two minutes before you feel the tears start to sting your eyes .|0
that is the answer . the question is : what is the single reason to watch this movie ? i will try and tell you as much as possible later . for instance , it starts out in a small town in iowa where a lot of people just think that there are better looking actors or actresses working on their acting . since the movie has been produced in a very small town ( at least half of the population does n't know they are living in iowa ) , many of those who see this movie assume that they have seen enough movies .|0
it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ` ` the sopranos , ' ' one of them ' . this is a classic comedy ( i have seen several films made in the last 5 years and they never got a title ) with a certain amount of drama and plot but nothing really much else . these are the type of movies that you can tell are actually very good by looking at their quality ; although the character is not the best , he still manages to win over the viewers . if the characters were original , this movie shows a few flaws .|0
ok - say some college in southern california has an movie making class . and some dudes were enrolled just for the hell of it ( or lack thereof ) . there are about a million other movies going on here . most of them go nowhere , but some have the potential to be pretty entertaining . the guy who writes the first one is not a very great actor . he talks a bit too much and is slow to come up with a script . if you ask me i was disappointed when i heard about what he had been doing during his entire life .|0
"This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before I was so bored with it I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. The premise of ""Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...."" has been done over and over to death."|1
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport. She's in a heap of trouble, I won't say what exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her out.I mention that because one of the grievances that the Chinese including the bandits who attack the American mission in this story set deep in the Chinese interior was that particular institution whereby American citizens who committed crimes were tried by American courts set up by our consulates. We were far from the only country doing that however.Anyway the story opens with her on a train for Shanghai trying to use a hokey Russian accent.|1
doctor who is amazing . it is everyones ' cup of tea ' . it must be . the boys will never remember this movie when it plays out . it has n't even been made in a movie . it has not been made in a movie , because it is too expensive . it just did not make it at home . i have seen worse movies and most of them are quite funny , but this one had something to do with being an american actor on the television series . i am thinking that it was really bad when they gave this movie to me last year .|0
"Normally I am a typical ""creepy-crawly-hatin'"" girl, but after watching this film (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc. ), and how a plucky young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Honey."|1
i have a 4yr old daughter , and before this movie she was all about the disney princesses , now she is not so good at them because she does not know how to act like one . what happened in that movie has changed her life in a big way . while she is still very young , she looks more like an adult than when i first saw it . you can read about this movie on the net or online . if you see it , please do not watch it . i have been seeing this movie for nearly three months now .|0
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.|1
when hollywood is trying to grasp what an ` ` intelligent person ' ' is like , they fail so miserably , they think it was a movie ! that ' intelligent people ' are in the wrong place at the right time . you ' re not even doing it on purpose ! i ' m sure you were only being friendly with the guy , and he couldn ' t seem to give any real evidence of his motives . well , there are some other reasons why i don ' t know if this is a terrible idea or not .|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. If watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. Sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable.|1
Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate.|1
"""The Apartment Complex"" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. This low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. ""The Apartment Complex"" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes."|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
"I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway in 1980. It starred George Hearn and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production, which was videotaped for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original tape's age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly pressed DVD."|1
This must be the most boring film I ever saw. The only positive I can say about it is that thankfully I didn't pay to see it. We were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film. The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting.|1
essentially plotless action film has two good guys ( fong and roundtree ) pitted against two bad guys ( mitchell ) and one of these two is a man . i thought that there would be more than a few moments when we should watch them together . unfortunately for me they are very different . i never understood what was in it all , but i think it must have had some special effect on me as the plot was just plain boring . however , this film is nothing compared with the other films that are like the movies of the world .|0
i love this movie ! it has everything ! bonnie hunt did a fantastic job co - writing , directing and co - starring in the first film of the year . i could n't stop reading that movie , i just ca n't help but believe you were wrong . if you like my book , do me a favor , and keep it quiet for a while . there are plenty of good reasons why this movie would be better than the previous one . i know that i was wrong . it was not the most exciting movie i have ever made , but i wanted to try .|0
"i just caught this on showtime . . . ewwwwwww , not even fun in a bad movie kind of way . "" she giggled . "" oh yeah ? is that how it is for the movie people who do make movies like this get paid to watch them . my brother and i actually think we have enough money to live here if we just pay for a few months of high school . then our parents will come back and give us a place to live . but we are so tired of having no one to talk to about anything , so we try to focus on being good at something ."|0
as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them . from the beginning , i loathed these films because they all made me feel bad for the people who watched them . and then i realized they were more of a curse than a fun show . in every movie i have ever seen it is always the same : there is never enough action - scenes that seem to be worth seeing at all . when i saw one of the films in 1952 , i thought it must have been so good that i wanted to buy it .|0
what a crap that movie is . the script is simply non existent . the movie at times seems like it would make a decent film in this case . the premise and characters are all too easy to pick apart . no one knows how the actors ' personalities work so we have to assume they are different , but for the most part , everyone seems to play along . i mean , come on , do you really want to watch a documentary about a kid murdered by his own parents and his girlfriend ? yes , i do , but it 's not funny .|0
"interesting cartoon , included on the dvd of ` ` the lost skeleton of cadavra ' ' . i especially like the part where cadavra makes his way into the forest in a strange manner and then comes back to the house after seeing what happened to his family . with all the time he spends out there he is sure to find himself in a state of deep depression . if it was possible for a zombie to get depressed , that is why they went to the trouble of making him a zombie . my favorite movie is "" zombies "" ."|0
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels.|1
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout?|1
I hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, I had to say something.I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it.This movie is one of my favorites of all time.|1
"The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less ""recognizable"", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose ""bar"" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty."|1
"this movie was outright painful for me to watch . i understand that indie films do not have the same quality as "" bad actors "" , but this one is much worse . i see a film of a woman getting ready to be attacked by her husband and her family while in the midst of a blizzard . when i heard this movie i felt a great need to get out of bed and leave it to my father , who had spent more time than most men on his feet and was so tired he actually fell asleep with the rest of the cast in tow ."|0
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for worst film of all time. A phony looking giant vulture attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. It's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, ""It Came From Hollywood,"" where this gem is hammered for the line, 'A Bird As Big As A Battleship', with gleeful, endless needling."|1
"I can't remember the series, I believe it may have been ""American Masters"", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why."|1
"` ` admissions ' ' is a fine drama even though they ' re are some problems with the ending . lauren ambrose was very convincing in her performance . "" "" yes , i know but i didn ' t listen to the first part because all of them were so beautiful , i could ' t focus on anything else . now i can ' t imagine being bored with anything else for another hour . i have never seen anything as boring as lauren ambrose ! it has to be at least 40 minutes before any of the other characters will come forward and try to figure out their own character ."|0
I agree with the guy above, It is so funny I understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I give this movie a 10 out 10.I have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month.|1
there really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef kate moorehouse . in other words it was the best damn film i have ever seen , but you ca n't tell anyone that - or they wo nt even believe you . i know this because i wrote this movie as a kid , and while i was bored by it , i also wanted to see how much of the story was true . anyway , i watched the movie from the beginning , and did a lot of reading .|0
i love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the Jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more.|1
this is the essence of the early eighties ! the malls , the credit card machines , the food , the clothes , the women . you ca n't help it if you are attracted to them - you will have to do more than stare at one or both in order to enjoy their company . i never thought anyone would go to all that trouble to create this kind of film . i personally saw it once and even felt bad for my parents , but i just was n't ready for this kind of thing . when i got the chance to watch the film i knew it had nothing to do with me .|0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again.|1
a chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room italian castle while still grieving the loss of an elderly aunt who died tragically . i can not even imagine what it must have been like for that poor old woman to see such horrible tragedy when she lived in europe . i am only sorry that my film has been so poorly rewritten . the story is too far gone and i was wrong about the quality of the editing . by the end , i simply did not want to read another single thing until i had made up my mind about the movie .|0
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has very much of.|1
"""Driving Lessons"" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (Linney), and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.Grint's portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film."|1
how do i describe the horrors ? ! ! ! first , some points : first , this review should have been an easy one for me to make , since there are two very hard things i can see happening with this book . second , i would really appreciate you coming up with a way to provide some feedback on my reading material . thanks again and i hope you find it interesting . also , please send these stories to me . if you want to get in touch with my readers , please do so by emailing me .|0
this is a very strange film , with a no - name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web . i thought it was really bad because of the movie but in reality it was great . it has been so good for me that i just wanted to watch it until i heard some music . there are some very interesting things that can be played here , and i wanted to see something from a different genre . i love this story as if it were the first book of the whole series . it seems like such a typical sci - fi comedy when you read it .|0
Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that.|1
"""Valley Girl"" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of ""Romeo and Juliet."" It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for ""Fast Times,"" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure."|1
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple.|1
let ' s get right to the heart of the matter . . . this is a terrible movie . the story is about a family and a man who has no idea what his actions are , or who he ' s hurt in the process . well , actually , i did know what i was doing ; i just had to watch it because i thought it would be really funny . however , you have to admit it was kind of boring . all these people being taken away from their loved ones for reasons unknown . i hate this stuff .|0
Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure film, that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing, poor characterisation and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he comes face-to-face with the Devil's Reaper  a demon who collects the Devil's debts i.e. souls  refusing to go to hell just yet, he evades the Reaper and starts a new life in an English monastery.|1
plot synopsis : los angeles in the future . crime is kept under control by core trackers , android assassins , but it has to be made to look like the real thing ; otherwise you 'll have no way of knowing what that means . the movie is very good at keeping people busy , and it does quite well . for a short while , i was enjoying my time off from work . i found out early on how this movie works when i went online to see the movie . i got to see it because of someone who happened to see it first .|0
"Kazuo Komizu strikes again with ""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman"", the sequel to ""Entrails of a Virgin"". This time around the story is based around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take on the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped-up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day. When she gets over her head and the Yakuza capture her, she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery. It apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine."|1
david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable , or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks . the film itself is not so bad ; in fact , i was hoping that this movie would be good enough for a new series . but i know better , i 've seen them before and have enjoyed them tremendously . this is supposed to be a classic comedy which i am pretty sure will never end up in the hands of an adult . if you want to watch some of these films , then do n't waste your time .|0
"Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name ""employee of the month"" might ring bells with ""Office Space,"" and the show ""Office Clerk."" I think not. This isn't even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7."|1
i loved this movie . my daughter is 3 1 / 2 and a country girl at heart . there are not too many lines in this movie . it does not have a very good ending as i was only thinking of the movie being about a girl who has two brothers . i wanted to enjoy this film , but after reading it i was so disappointed when it ended . now , i do not have to spend $ 20 dollars on this movie . this movie just sucks . why am i watching this ? what happened to be such a good movie ?|0
imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are the worst thing you could possibly imagine . no wonder you have to go to the movies at least twice a week , this is just awful . but , if i 'm gon na watch this film , i guess that i will just have to make it as boring as possible ! there 's no way i can turn down an opportunity to enjoy this horror movie so i ca n't stay here and watch this . why not just buy some dvds and watch the movie ?|0
this is pure crap , and probably the worst biblical theme film ever . . . absolutely inaccurate , i mean , what was that about ? . . . you could n't just let him live . he had to be one of the richest men in hollywood . if you see his wife again , tell her to go home . . . it 's bad enough that a lot of people think i 'm a bad movie . well , it certainly does make for an awful film . . . at least i can start looking forward to the first two episodes .|0
I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006).This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it).Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!'|1
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic , as the whole point of the programme was to be a good one . i would like to start off by telling you something which i have absolutely no interest in hearing about in any case , it has been a long time since i have come here to listen to this tape , and it still gives me some peace and quiet . but i can get bored with it because the only thing that really appeals to me in this novel is how the movie is played , even if it is not well - executed .|0
this is horrible film . it is past dumb . first , the only thing the twins care about is how fast i am going to go in order to get out of here on time ( although they may not be that much of a stickler for punctuality at all ) . the plot is so boring that you do not want to spend any more time watching your movies . you also find yourself doing a pretty good job of reading what is in the films because there is always something to read . just like my sister , who makes fun of the other girl 's favorite movies .|0
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie. Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I have seen worse acting. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and was really a interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably wont enjoy this, but if you are you'll like this movie.The main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites.|1
fabulous cinematography from sergei urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work . the opening scenes are as bad as the acting is good . one of my favorite movies has been so far , that i do not believe i have ever seen it . what 's more , it was about three weeks after i saw it and i still did n't know where it came from . it was like seeing the first movie of all time at an unsold store . there must have been tens of thousands of books in the world and most of them were made during the third world war .|0
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it's all over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. There is enough of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.|1
i just watched the dvd of this award winning film . one life stand is a stark drama that through some unknown reason ends up with a woman getting raped in front of me . it does not add up to any of the movie standings we have seen recently . the main attraction of this movie comes when the actress gets shot in the head and dies in the hospital while trying to escape an attack by her captor . after witnessing the crime , i immediately wanted to go out and see if anything interesting could happen . there was nothing unusual about this movie at all .|0
"There's only 2 reasons I watch this show...I invested the time already in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you supposed Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is ""who is the fifth cylon"". Poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development."|1
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything.|1
"i like the wind and the lion very much . it was a good movie . i thought that since it was n't a romance , maybe you could make it better . anyway , this is why i chose this movie to see . it would have gone better if you had just come to me instead of sending me to watch the movie . so , no , thanks . "" she started to leave the movie store . 
 "" are you leaving ? "" i called out as she made her escape . 
 "" yup , but i promise i wo n't stay long , "" she said , not even looking back once ."|0
When I stepped into the theater, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S.|1
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature.|1
sorry i could n ' t disagree more , with the last comments . frankly i thought this was worse than carry on . there was a guy at the beginning of it all - an actor and his wife and her husband . they are very nice to the audience but you can see that they are trying to be polite so they give each other dirty looks . some of their comments are in fact just like what i had read before . those remarks are directed towards me by some of the most untrustworthy characters i have ever seen .|0
the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like it was the first night of school . i 'm not even sure which movie it is , but my gut instinct is to put the show on the back burner . you can bet your life that none of this film will have been approved by the government at all . well , not for years anyways . we have some good movies out there from the early 1930s and early 2000 's . we just do n't want to start using them again .|0
received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which specializes in art - house flics , they released irreversible effects on the production of their original work . so much so that i have had to stop my movies from being produced at all because they were still too controversial . and because i could not afford to publish them in the first place ! how can a movie such as these be good ? this is one of those ' 80s horror movies where the plot seems so bad you ca n't tell the two characters apart .|0
Significant Spoilers! This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.|1
In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during WWII. In a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.This is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the Ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated.|1
I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through.|1
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film, and that's the weight of the plot. I don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it, expecting the film to be as it was marketed... The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuses and defames graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay.|1
I'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although because of the poor story flow, I'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. The story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on.|1
i ca n ' t believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website ! have i been to any of these places ? i 've never felt so ignorant . i thought there were no more films and i just thought i was going to die when i came across this one . now it turns out there are only four other movies in the budget for this film that i can see as well . what do you think of it ? ! first , i have to give you the short version of what i heard from a friend .|0
how offensive ! those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible . i can imagine those at the baptist church were very proud of what they saw in this one . i would n't be and i 'm really glad i was there because i think it is absolutely terrible . i do n't understand why these people thought that they should go to a synagogue . but then again , maybe not . it is funny how you ca n't read the bible without looking at the story . let me give you some examples . matthew 12:11 , 24 . john 3:16 . matthew 4:17 .|0
it ' s hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so - so film noir . there just is n ' t a thing about this film i like . the plot is that some poor person , or someone , goes to bed early and loses consciousness in the middle of the night . this happens at least a few times a week . on average , i do n't get to see these films . i only watched them once . i was bored out of my mind with boredom after seeing one . i sat through three episodes of the bad boy and went to sleep .|0
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', Poland could play the role it did in WWII, being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna.|1
There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying.|1
This movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and hearing, and I didn't believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match.|1
"Okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time ""horror"" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie?"|1
a scientist ( george zucco ) wants to create wolf men out of american soldiers to fight the nazis , who can not be bothered . but that is not true . there is another version of wolf men which would make you laugh if you could write it down . i used to work in the cia and had seen enough films to have a general idea of the kind of movie that we are talking about . it was made in 1947 by a guy named fred astaire , who wanted to use nuclear warheads as weapons before taking on an alien mission .|0
whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film - making , it ' s thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever . if you have any questions about the action , please leave a review on goodreads and i will do all i can to make this book better . thank you so much for your help in editing this story . it really was an honor to have such a successful film made by one of the most talented stars in hollywood . there has been too much hype for my liking . the fact that the guy who wrote this would be able to write something like this makes no sense to me .|0
This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.|1
"This film flopped miserably in the UK, and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was ""Atonement: Part 2"". While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to Wales."|1
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere.|1
oppenheimer was a great series ( it was the first thing i saw waterston in ) and it is too bad he did n't make it . the movie was awful , but this movie was not . there was nothing wrong with the acting , it was just terrible . you see , most of the actors were young boys and some of them really seemed to want to have their brains bashed out at the worst time possible , which was very disappointing . what can you do for a kid who does not have any imagination ? well , one thing is for certain : the movie was horrible .|0
"first off , i ' m a huge bronson fan , have been since the late ' 70s . i watched every one of my old movies on that dvd and was pretty good about it . at least , i could say that i watched all of my movies on the same tape . when i was thirteen - years - old , there was a film called "" black hole "" that involved a spaceship that crashed into mars in 1927 . i do not remember what made this movie but i knew it had to have something to do with science ."|0
this is absolute drivel , designed to shock and titillate the 60 ' s mindset . the acting is completely wooden , so what 's the point ? if you think about it it , the movie is a waste of time . no more than 30 minutes later there is an excerpt from the last scenes of the first film which suggests that i should have listened in when i was younger . ok , let me ask you : how can someone play something as bad as this ? why would anyone want to do this ? it has to be some sort of plot flaw or something like that .|0
in brooklyn , the nightclub dancer rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in a band . rusty is one of those guys who thinks he 's in love with his new girlfriend because of her name . rusty is n't quite so lucky ; he only knows one girl and he ca n't have her . if you read this novel , it would be like looking at a tv screen . that movie ' s not much fun , as i 'm pretty sure the story is completely unrealistic . i know there are some good movies in here , but none that really impress me .|0
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" "" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" "" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO ."|1
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other heist film has come close to it, before or after. The plot is simple, but engrosses you. It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. You care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. It's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois.|1
this is the australian tv series . it is a classic . the stories and actors are excellent . who cares about the movie in the first place ? why bother if it 's just gon na happen anyway ? well , i think i have enough of this story for now . i can not understand why anyone would put a plot in action to get things done . i really want to learn about these films that you see on television . there are lots of interesting things to do on television . i wanted to see more of them ; i like to watch my favorite movies .|0
No,no,no. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates,as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems like a colorized version of Psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Norman,and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folks,do yourself some justice. Don't bother with this.|1
WARNING: PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality.|1
my favourite movie of all time . this was a flawed piece of work by coppola and seeing the documentary , i felt an affinity for it as well . in fact , i am convinced that coppola also wanted to save his son 's life . i can say that this film was not one of those films where the actor loses his job , or has to do away with people he knew for more than twenty minutes . however , this film was so bad at its best ; it did n't seem to be worth saving even though there was absolutely nothing special about it .|0
* * * * contains spoilers * * * * as a fan of rachael leigh cook , i watched her in paris . she was a pretty girl with long brown hair and an american accent . but that was because her parents had taken her to disney world when she was young . her father has been gone for several years and she spends most of her time sleeping at home . so the movie is not really mine . my mother would like me to take it back to england to watch it on one of the many channels that show movies in america , but i just do n't have the energy .|0
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment.Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way of wasting it.It was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted.|1
i am a huge fan of harald zwart , and i just knew that i had to see this movie in person , but not at the cinema . you see he was very nice and i like him even more because of the good qualities of his work as a writer . so i went along with this film ( i did n't really want to be part of it when i first heard about it ) and i tried to enjoy it for its sake , because i was afraid that what i saw on the screen would make me cry .|0
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by Hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities.|1
check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense has n ' t yet kicked in . we get a pretty good look at it , and i ca n't help but feel a bit uneasy for some reason . just how much could this movie be worth ? after all , when the movie starts , you have to pay a special attention to details like what the characters are doing or saying . this is not a movie where you can spend an entire night waiting for someone to come up with a better way to go about this .|0
"stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is , in many ways , a modern equivalent of dickens ' "" all that jazz "" ( which i prefer not to talk about , as i have always thought ) . although the play is an unusual affair , it was based on an episode from one of the first films i ever heard about . i really wanted to watch this one , since i had n't seen it in years , but found myself disappointed when the whole thing did not go as i had expected it would ."|0
"i can only think of one reason this movie was released . to capitalize off the upcoming fame of guy and / or lady in love with the most famous hollywood actress in the world . it could n't be a coincidence that the director , ' dave ' , had the title "" chick flick , "" so why would she give it to you ? is this a good idea ? i mean , how many people in this movie know about this movie ? oh well , they will see what happens once they watch it . now all you can do is sit back and enjoy ."|0
"` ` hollywood cavalcade ' ' is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th century fox roster , and a movie made in the late 1890s which has its origins in an old indian town . this film was first released in texas in 1972 , and before that it came up in the 1980s as a classic . "" i ' m going to be a fan ! "" one of the other characters said . i knew it was a mistake , but what could i have done ? i decided to make my way back to washington for a chat with some of my colleagues on the team ."|0
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever.|1
"I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. It's not that I don't ""get it"" -- I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought ""Don't tell them, show them,"" then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.First of all, The Terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this."|1
` ` 200l : a space odyssey ' ' is a supremely intriguing space - travel journey with a profound look at mankind ' s life and its present situation , but it must be written to the public . the movie is based on a science fiction movie , but it is far more complex than anything i have ever seen before . this movie was set up as a documentary that i think you will like . i would recommend letting it run for another year or so , while you are learning your way around all these parts . after the movie , you may read some of my books .|0
i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film . it is apparent that none of them will see this movie , as there is too much sadness to be felt in this book . so many other people have lost their lives and now they do n't have to make any effort to live up to what they want to do . we can only watch it for so long before something gets caught up in it and dies . no wonder i hate movies like this . they are nothing more than a load of crap that makes no sense .|0
my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $ 5 . 00 . but since it featured the worst thing i could ever do , i decided to give it another go - and see how it reacted . there were a few good laughs . i can still hear it in my head , even after i get off of the stage . well , let me tell you something . as an adult , i knew that ' bad movie ' films are always bad , but this one is worse . it was so horrible that i had no choice but to leave the theatre .|0
i would like to submit the following goof . during the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river and walking down it . but when the soldiers enter a cave , they get confused about where they should put their clothes ( which is why they come up with a dress ) . as one of them follows behind the others , it 's easy to tell what happens on the water ; it is very difficult for anyone to see . at the bottom of this story , however , is something that appears to be made of stone .|0
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasn't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest.|1
this is a semi fictional memoir of an ` ` international man ' ' who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent years and which have caused a lot of problems . after the first few days he got used to the idea of being with a bunch of people who are constantly trying to make a life that does n't include anyone important , including himself . they do n't seem to understand where we came from , or how we could have been so stupid . on the other hand , i 'm going to be honest here .|0
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s, Italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films didn't make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and `exploited' by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday.|1
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash 's second year . yash is an amazing character , he is a natural born director , who spends more money in movies than he does in movies . however , yash has been acting all his life and this movie is not something he would expect to see at home . how did yash put up with this ? as far as any other films i have seen this movie , i just wish i could say that i really liked them .|0
there is a serious scene in this movie . a scene that lets you know that his film wo n ' t go on any longer , but it does n't stop there . i just ca n't understand how anyone can believe that such a horrible movie ever had to start up again . maybe because the plot was based on so many of my favorite shows . well let me rephrase that and pick a worse version of the film . ok , the film could have done better by someone who really wants to live it up , but i am pretty sure neither of those men even saw what they were talking about .|0
real - life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star in creation , which recounts the period of charles darwin ' journey to immortality . at that point , the author does not know how or where he came upon this story , though he knows from experience it is a fascinating one . so why am i still here ? why am i thinking about all of this now ? what do i need to do to find out the reason why i was brought into this ? i just ca n't remember what happened . for the past two decades , i have been living on an isolated island surrounded by barren trees .|0
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around) a heroin addict really is. Good movie, which will never truly be outdated. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE'S world can become. Worth a look--an education of sorts. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in.|1
"Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oPThis movie is ""D"" quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997."|1
"This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, ""Don't bother with us, we're all losers,"" you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. All the usual suspects are here."|1
"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison."|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time, I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. This is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.This show sucks.Its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous.|1
Don't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.As I said, the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing.|1
"abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made ` ` bamako , ' ' but the rest of us are just confused about whether this movie was made . ' i am really hoping it will not be an issue in this story as well . "" "" i 'm sorry , i know that some of you were enjoying it , but this is a documentary and not a horror film . if we had learned to read books and watched movies at school , why did we not learn anything ? i am sure you realize that we do not care too much about how the movie turns out ."|0
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini.|1
another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is . i especially remember the scene where the man in the sand gets ripped to shreds by a giant wave . he is so torn that he jumps in and tries to help save his friend from being eaten by the sharks , which is totally uncalled for . i would have thought he would be too embarrassed to do it himself . when you watch movies like this they always start with a splash and then get all the way to the end . as far as i know this movie was not made just for my enjoyment , but for myself .|0
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's supposed to be a remake or update of ""The One-armed Swordsman"", by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. The script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, ""And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..."" or ""If only I'd known what a heavy price I would have to pay."" Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Sing?"|1
a gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on le touquet for a week ' s holiday . stories intertwine , characters have their own names and i know this is going to be one long , uninteresting story . in fact , i have read the book twice , and only once did i find it at all interesting . you can say that when i first came here , i found myself drawn to something about these guys that i had absolutely no reason not to like . but i saw this film as a way to get to know them .|0
"Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as ""Poison Ivy"", must have done this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer on ""Ivy""); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!"|1
this movie was lacking in a lot of areas . it ' s about this elvis type guy who races cars with no idea how to drive and never even knows if he is making the right move . the plot was so bad that i just wanted to make it more believable . but then , i don ' t think you can really imagine how bad this movie is . here we are on the night of his murder . what kind of show is this ? does this look as bad as i expected it would ? oh well , i am glad i decided to get this movie together .|0
You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen.I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork.|1
i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up . ( got ta love these people ) . it was fun to watch but i also loved this show . as the director , you should not have listened to what the other two guys would say or do . they could n't even make one good joke . their jokes just did n't sit right in their heads . the funniest thing they told me was a bunch of lame jokes that they thought made sense . i tried to find something funny about them , but there is no humor to this show at all .|0
put simply , this mini - series was terrible . let me count the ways . 1 . absurd plotting . 2 . unlikable plot line . 3 . completely inappropriate acting . 4 . not to mention the fact that he was really good at a lot of things ! so why could n't he have just been a normal person in life ? i do n't want to think about those things . there 's no way for me to know who they were and i ca n't blame people for taking him seriously because i did .|0
since i am a fan of natalie portman , i had to see the movie . i enjoyed every minute of it . this one was so bad it would have taken a lot longer to paint it . i think i could have made some money with that movie . my family and i actually went out to dinner and then we spent the night in the hotel room watching it . i ca n't tell you how impressed i was . i got really lost in the plot when i saw her first film ; i just started thinking she should be wearing a cape and riding a horse .|0
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the U.S. and couldn't work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe.|1
"I'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either ""Love it"" or ""Hate it"" movie. And I have to say that I not only am on the ""Love it"" side, I'm going on a limb to say it this my FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thank heavens I found it in the first place. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel."|1
` ` the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together . you are probably wondering why i had to do this : i felt like an outsider when i first met these two people , and i was afraid they would say or do anything to harm my work . i was just waiting for the appropriate opportunity to ask some questions about them . it seems as if their story does n't have any substance at all . i hope you will agree that the story ' s quality is very decent but its overall bad .|0
there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short . i want to take a break for a minute and find out what is going on . the first thing my editor just told me was that this film is a classic movie made in 1955 , but very old . we did n't see the film for more than 2 months before it appeared in 1937 . i can understand why people would say that it was pretty lame . this movie was made in 1966 ; one of the funniest movies i have seen since the beginning of the 21st century .|0
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended, I was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.It's not bad in an entertaining way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors.|1
Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema, I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean movies under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize.|1
this is a horrific re - make of the french movie ma vie en rose ( http : / / imdb . com / title / tt0119590 / ) . the scene is made up as you go , but it is not complete . i know there is some kind of an explanation in there , but i ca n't think what that would be . at any rate , my father did not approve of this re - make , he simply gave me a very bad grade , and if you can imagine his reaction , i have plenty to say . i just do not want to mention it .|0
given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost ca n ' t help but be a rather depressing character , or so they all think - and i swear , it is not at all accurate . there have been times when i have found it very interesting to know that a person has a habit of abusing their body with drugs ( heroin , cigarettes , alcohol , liquor , alcohol , women , sex ) . this is also one of the most inhumane examples of the treatment of addicts , for example . some people do n't seem addicted at all .|0
"A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the ""Godzilla"" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like ""The Loch Ness Horror"". And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits."|1
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing crud! Incidentally, the bit about Canada joining the US didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President(but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that).|1
i mean , come on ! this movie had such nice potential but it ' s like they ran out of film a couple years ago or something . not only that , but it ' s too cheesy to give a damn about if you ' re actually the character of a great movie . in fact , this is nothing more than some kind of joke for people who think it ' s funny to watch this movie because they don ' t want to get caught . it ' s probably the worst thing anyone could do when making fun of the movie .|0
` ` mararia ' ' really disappointed me . i ca n ' t consider it as a bad movie , but the development of the movie is interesting and not necessarily what you think it is . however , the entire plot has gone to hell . although it seems to be pretty straightforward , when i look back on these films , i realize that there must have been some other reasons why they were allowed to use this film at all . for those of you who did n't know this , i was one of many people who attended the very first movie theater in new york city .|0
spoiler alert ! do n ' t read on unless you ' re prepared for some spoilers . i think this film had a lot more fun last night than the rest of the series . the plot was very good - in fact , it could have been better . the first part is one of my favorite films that has ever gone before , so if i wanted to watch it with you i shall . . . i ' m not sure how to describe it . there is no question in my mind what type of action it would lead to .|0
ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes , directs and stars in ' vampire assassins ' . derek washington plays this movie well . i did n't know he was a film buff or anything of that nature . he looks like he spent a lot of time in the gym . it just does n't ring true . i watched the movie for almost an hour and still can not decide whether to be flattered or creeped out by the whole thing . what makes me think that derek is a vampire is because he acts like one . i mean , who else would be playing vampire hunter ?|0
this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row , public domain films from the first half of the 20th century . there were a lot of unflattering scenes and it was so horrible i thought i would just go home for the evening and put myself to sleep . not an option . i am too excited to eat . i wanted to take a walk in the park at least and look at some of the different types of trees on display . it took me longer than normal to work up the courage to leave my house . no one seemed to see anything funny .|0
i ' m not going to ramble on about it but i ' m just going to make it brief . basically , i went to a movie and thought it would be fun . there was such a buzz that i wasn ' t paying attention to anything in the movie . when i saw this movie it seemed like the most important thing in the entire movie . of course the plot is a bit boring . there are lots of scenes where someone goes missing and then another person is found dead . this movie could have gone on indefinitely .|0
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward.|1
In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris' cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.|1
this film is terrible - honestly . the acting is terrible , the script made me cringe , the effects are horrible . the plot is bad , i ca n't help but feel pity for anyone who falls victim to this film . what a bunch of idiots they are ! there is absolutely nothing that can be said about these movies ; i do n't even know who you guys are and what your game is . ok , it is not exactly a game . so let 's see how well you would fare if you played it all the way through .|0
the tv show was slow moving and the ' offbeat ' characters were sometimes irritating . only through the miracle of comedy can we really see what is in front of us , and that is nothing like any of the others . all of this is just a bit too dramatic to watch while watching it with anyone else . i do not mind at all being in a movie full of action , especially if i have something nice to share with people . but even so , there are some moments where you just know that this movie would make my life a whole lot easier .|0
now , i love bad , old skifee movies as much as most people . and i understand that a lot of good movies go bad at the start of each week , but this movie does n't even have any redeeming value . it just shows off all of its flaws . for example , this guy who lives in the neighborhood with his best friend makes a joke about getting arrested for being an ass * * le . well , what is up with that ? if you see someone act so stupid , why are they here ? why are they doing this ?|0
"lame . lame . lame . ultralame . shall i go on ? there is one , i repeat * : ' i know you are not really a comedian . i like your music and it 's great , but i am just not an actress or singer . my songs are in the same vein as this movie , except they are different . "" he pulled the microphone off the small stage and looked directly at the director of the movie . 
 "" we do have some excellent comedies here . this is one of those films where no - one speaks much , and everybody knows about the characters who are actors ."|0
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff film. I guess I'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties.|1
I have only praise for this film. From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. This one however changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have actully played Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does he turns to gold.|1
a fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot - - though not original - - promised me a nice ending . i also had this great idea that maybe the story should be made into a movie . to make a short story like this more interesting , it is worth thinking about . i saw a few comedies when i was in college but i do not have a fan interest in them . at least i hope i did not . i think i wanted to come with you for this book , but i could n't understand why you were interested in doing this .|0
"I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of film-making (shot on DV, to boot) is quite an eye-sore! I liked the script's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer. As to the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the 'star' of those horrid ""Redemption"" intros) has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious."|1
it looked cool from the movie sleeve , but after five minutes we were n ' t sure if it was a good idea to buy it . instead of putting the film in a box and loading the dvd into it , we opted to just watch the movie on my phone . i have no idea what happened to make the movie come out as bad as it does , but one thing for sure : this movie has absolutely zero redeeming quality . i had never been to a school where there were any decent educational programs , which i guess was kind of hard not seeing as all of them seem so unsanitary .|0
Everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if I'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. Good: The overall plot was mildly interesting. The music was overall pretty good.|1
"If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demise. ""Rififi"" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision."|1
"in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950 ' s . leon , the leader of this gang is known as "" bootlegger "" and he is notorious for going to any bars where he can get away with doing that . but no matter which bar he is meeting at , i know what happens there . it is just bad luck that leon finds his old buddy here who has got some crazy shit going on in his club . if you 're into something real bad , you might be interested in finding out what it is ."|0
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.|1
I was duped as well. Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get.An hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.I thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.Damn I was sooooo wrong. It was very hard to watch the whole thing.Don't fool yourself. Its not so good that its bad. Its not even that kind of movie.Its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!|1
the other reviewer was completely correct about this one . the writing was awful , the acting was awful , and the characters were dumb and insincere . in fact , they just made me feel like i was not a real person . it was so embarrassing that i started crying right off the street . the whole thing only took ten minutes , which was at least the longest fifteen minutes of my life . when i finally got over the tears , i realized that i still had three days before i went back home . i had forgotten all about that one until the moment i arrived here .|0
"my wife invited my son and i to watch this on cable tv on a lazy saturday evening , thinking about how much better things would be if we had the money . but she was wrong . i could have done it . "" he laughed . "" not that i am trying to make a great film , "" he added hastily , "" just that there was one movie i found very good . and i think you might be surprised at how often it goes down . it is an original , and it is absolutely awesome . in fact , it is so good that i am actually having fun watching it ."|0
when george sluizer was told he could direct an american version of the book ` ` het gouden ei ' ' / the plot ' is not much different from this one . but i had a great time watching that , because it makes me smile to watch someone play this kind of film . i found it hard to be jealous of the director who is doing the screenplay as he portrays actors . even if he was acting , the action and content would be very unrealistic . there was no way that this movie would ever be made . so i felt that it was necessary to see the movie .|0
"Just awful. It's almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plodding, passionless mishmash could result. But that's television for you -- filler between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the period re-creation, which screams ""1928"" in banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and waistcoats, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) -- with all the attention paid to pointless, arty detail, the important matters get ignored.Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or competent writing and acting."|1
"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. ""Constantine""), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la ""Manos The Hands of Fate""). Now that I've seen ""Dr. Gore"" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly execrable."|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great.|1
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it doesn't have any continutity. It feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software!!! Music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby deol is good.|1
believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious . the basic story is about kintaro oe who is a rich american man who has been living in an old house and has some money saved up from his investments . the fact that she was born into this family is amazing . the stories are great , but the actors are not very good . while they all seem to have a strong grasp of english and russian history , there is also something weird about them . the first thing you notice about the characters is how many times they have gone out of their way to make us laugh .|0
i know my summary sounds very harsh , but this film has very limited appeal . the average joe out here is twenty - two years old and his background is all wrong . what was the point of being born into the world ? you would never get an education like this in a movie industry . it 's just not realistic . i got bored when i saw this movie and spent a good part of the evening on the internet looking for a real video game . i came up with some ideas that made me more curious about what kind of character they would want to live with .|0
"at the time of this writing ( january 25 , 2006 ) , i am saddened to hear of the loss of his son by his wife and two daughters . it is very tragic . in my opinion , this was the worst book i 've ever read . it was not just one of those awful blockbuster movies or even a "" bad review "" . well , it was an excellent cover shot . i have never seen a worse copy of this series in my whole life , but i had to give it some more thought before deciding whether it was worth keeping or not ."|0
A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People begin to wonder if they did it. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. The cops speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to trial. They are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented.|1
a terrible deception : controversial film , winner of the teddy in berlin 2003 , mil nubes de paz turned on to watch it ( which is where the story goes ) . but all of this could have happened months ago ; we have nothing but a few months to wait . and i still do n't know how i am supposed to react when i get to the movie because i never really thought that they were actually going to do any of these things . what do you want me to say ? i can not understand how anyone could even go out on a date with someone who is so bad .|0
"There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's ""Robe d'Ete"". It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl."|1
i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live . you can watch them or buy them from the same store . i do have a lot of friends , but i feel no attachment to one film . it was all about the characters , the actors , the plot and the way in which they lived , so i did not bother watching any of these films . it had its own story that i felt would make me happier . i just never believed in anything like this kind of thing unless it was really important .|0
this movie stars ben kingsley as frank , a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo . the movie is not particularly good and makes me wonder what they have in mind for it . i can understand that some might like an action movie to come , but it 's not my kind of thing . this was just one of those moments where you do not know what to expect . when you watch the movie , you are wondering if you should be paying attention , or if these guys are going to steal from you after you leave your house and start terrorizing innocent people .|0
"i rented a copy of this one from netflix - - big mistake . the dvd version titled ` ` the one - armed ' does have an impressive number of references , but is that it ? "" "" no , "" norman said . he was looking at the video image , trying to see it clearly . he wanted to know if it might be used as a way to find any evidence on the computer or on the screen , and if there would be any possible connection between the two . it was all fairly simple , really ."|0
In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her.|1
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. The film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. But there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. The film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going.|1
if you ' re coming to this film to learn something about depression , forget it : you wo n ' t learn anything from it . what do i know about depression and the effects that it might have had on a young , healthy person . no way ! i just wish we could talk about it like people should . all i really care is how bad my book is . i ' ve been trying to put it into some context for the last twenty hours , and now it falls flat . i have to admit it wasn ' t very well - done .|0
"before i start to tear apart this movie , mark you - - i love the scarlet pimpernel . that story is so awful that i would n't even consider buying it for $ 1.99 . "" "" you do realize you 're making this a lot worse by reading these stories ? they make me sick . "" "" i have no doubt of that . i was just thinking about it myself . i 've never been much of a comedienne in school and this movie makes me wish i ever listened to it . i could get used to seeing it every day instead of going on a daily basis .

"can you people please stop believing everything this man says . getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar . "" i 've never seen anything like it ! if i had my way i 'd go to the fbi right about now because they do a lot of investigative reporting on things like this . these people are very bad , and i think they are just using the wrong people for their purposes . i have no idea how many people died in that house today , and what happened to this guy . well , we better get down there and see where he is going next with his story ."|0
i really do n ' t know why i ' m writting this . i think most people agree that this movie is bad , and if you take the wrong part you ' ll lose everything you have been told . there is only so many ways to make an acting career of something as boring as the film : it ' s pretty boring ! but for those who were not familiar with the world of hollywood , this movie had its good moments . one memorable character was a young girl , who lived in the neighborhood of where she grew up ( in los angeles ) .|0
"What can I say? After having read Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they appeared to ""big stalagtites"" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate."|1
"there is a point in the film where the female boss of the ` ` death machines ' ' ( a multi - ethnic cult ) appears to be having an affair with another woman , so it is highly likely that she is killed on the scene . "" "" well , i do n't know whether to laugh or not . they really should stop doing this sort of thing . the whole genre has always been one of the worst films ever made and i just have to say that you should watch them more for entertainment value than actual enjoyment ."|0
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.It is one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like ""Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,"". When I saw that, I figured it would be yet another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff by Disney. But I had no idea how bad.Fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the T.V."|1

 as i read the title , i suddenly realized that the story is completely unoriginal . the story itself was fairly straightforward , but there were a few things about it that i did not like at all . some of the phrases were actually amusing , others were offensive , and so on , but i had to start from the beginning when i began to write this book ."|0
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at Eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, I see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society.|1
Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context.|1
"everyone ' s already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a serious crush on them or knew them well . in most cases , it actually seemed more of a joke than anyone would have thought . if anything , all the comments made me feel like i "" d seen a ghost . "" however , you don "" t see many of these kinds of people in movies and magazines . they usually just talk to their own characters - as if they have a choice . so , i wasn "" t sure what to make of this new twist ."|0
the kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant , russ duritz , who has lots of talent and seems to be a pretty decent actor . it was actually pretty boring to watch , but at least i 'm able to remember some of the scenes . i guess this would have been better if i could have seen the actual scene . there were all kinds of things i expected when i first looked at the film , but none of those things compared to this . not even close . in fact it was like watching a cheesy western .|0
"now out of all the shark movies i ' ve seen , this one takes the cake ! the plot of the first movie has always been predictable and it seems to have gotten more so since then . here are the parts : 
 a good friend told me about an accident that happened to a guy who was trying to get in the water . he tried to make it across the lake at a fair amount of times , but the water was too far away and he wasn ' t very strong . on the other side of the lake he drowned and was taken to some place where he could not be found ."|0
Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real.David Tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.But now Billie has left and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe).|1
` ` while sporadically engrossing ( including a few effectively tender moments ) and humorous , the sledgehammer - obvious satire ' homecoming ' is simply too much for one man to deal with all day . as you know , many times it is possible to look at a hollywood movie and expect it to be an awesome thing . this movie was not even based on the real world . the first scene was really good enough that i just could n't wait to get back to it . i was trying to watch my favorite horror flick because it reminded me of being in college .|0
i too saw this film at a film festival , but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and annoying . i just do n't understand what the difference is between the acting and the actual action in the movie . after all , the main character is supposed to be a guy and instead he turns into a girl . not that i am thinking that there was anything wrong with this movie or the movie itself , but i can only conclude that something was up about the movie before the movie was even started .|0
i had n ' t planned on leaving a review , but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie made me think it needed a good writing . you see , every time i looked at one of these films or saw one of my friends ' names , that 's when i decided to go home . so i just sat there and waited for another episode to begin . then i got up to get some food while the actors tried to figure out their script . all in all , it was a pretty boring movie .|0
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don't know how many times.Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer.|1
This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. If this weren't bad enough, some guy named Count de Sade is living there as well. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. Anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs.|1
"fulci . . . does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made ? answer : yes ! he is absolutely hilarious ! i had to laugh out loud to save my life , even though i do n't really understand how it can work that way . after all , it is so obvious that this movie has a lot of "" b "" lines , but the plot was so bizarre that i decided to take a peek into the story . the first thing that you learn about a movie when you live in a new country is that you ca n't just go back and change the plot ."|0
i thought this was a great action flick . a very good role for geena davis . she is a really pretty lady , well - dressed and with a wonderful personality . so , do n't let her down . i have seen the movie a couple of times and am not in the least bit suspicious about the acting . however , i did hear it is a bad show . the director is a jerk , but at least he is decent at his job . you ca n't even tell that he does anything wrong . oh well , there are some good movies in this one , so what can i say ?|0
i have n ' t laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made ! talk about an understatement . the movie was mediocre but it got worse from the beginning ; not to mention the plot , character , etc . i had to use my imagination to make this stuff interesting . the main problem is that it was quite a horror movie when i first started seeing it . at some point during the film i decided to take a look at other films i had seen and discovered they were n't all bad .|0
"I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece ""The Deerhunter."" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business."|1
What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders.|1
Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame. Firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would turn up late on set, change the script, crew etc and generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his trouble enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this garbage.|1
obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point : the little vasque town of obaba . there you can find more than two - thirds of every book and novel that is made up of characters from all over japan , india , new zealand and the pacific rim . as it turns out , this one has got to be the worst i 've ever looked at in my life . the first movie was about a japanese boy who lives in a small hamlet in a small village in the far western corner of the country .|0
thats what this movie really takes . a big piece of cheeze . this movie is about a sister and her teenage daughter in a new subdivision on the outskirts of los angeles . at first , this was not a bad movie ; but as i watch this movie , i realize there is nothing to laugh at about it . there is little to laugh at either . we just see an old couple being chased by dark - haired kids who are all laughing and having fun . then after they take them out of the picture , the story starts going nowhere .|0
"I'm a big horror film buff, particularly of the 1980's subgenres. Name one  I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called ""Saw"" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet...those just looked terrible!) I saw the film on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life."|1
probably because this is columbia ' s first film in color , the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes , but i just do not understand what would cause them to go into a movie without seeing it . i had seen the movie at least half an hour ago ; i just wanted to know if it would be that easy . we sat on the couch as we waited for the cast and crew to show up . the director came out and introduced himself . he was tall , with sandy blond hair and pretty features . he introduced himself as richard morris .|0
i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back . it was so bad , i can only describe it by the term ' horrible . ' i mean , not terrible at all - just awful . i really had hoped to live in one of their cities , where everyone else lived in huts or small shacks . i do n't know if that is going to be an option for me any longer . i actually enjoyed it and it felt good . i thought they might have killed me , but it turned out that the men who did the killing were actually very decent guys .|0
just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . take mike myers , for example . i remember being surprised to hear that he 's the one who started it , but how could that surprise me when there are only three different movies in this book ? all of them were good , but there was no reason for us to be so impressed by this one . i wonder why people would think that they should have an episode where someone plays tom cruise and takes his wife out to a beautiful romantic comedy . oh wait , it never starts .|0
this film is absolutely appalling and awful . it ' s not low budget , it ' s a no budget film , which is why the title was such a downer in comparison to the films on the tv shows that i ' ve seen so far . but if you have to see one of these then you are looking at a bad time for the characters , and they certainly don ' t act as if they are trying to be a hero , they don ' t even look like they are doing anything other than putting their feet down and getting out of the way when things go wrong .|0
this is easily one of the worst movies i ' ve seen in a long long time ( and i ' ve seen enough of the films to know what they are ) but it was the only one with the best plot . you ' re going to have to watch this movie because there are many more things that can go wrong than this . also , it was very disappointing for all of my other favorite movies as well as getting some good action flicks . it was like watching a bad soap opera from the early 20th century when you had to wait an hour for the final outcome .|0
` ` wagons east ' ' is widely known as john candy ' s last movie , as he died on the set of this very movie and was made to look like him . you see , one night in october , he had a party at his estate with his best friend and two cousins who lived in a big log cabin . when candy came home late that night , the party was just starting to get under way . unfortunately , i am afraid there were too many drinks involved . it was a mistake to invite candy into the party since she probably would have just let it drop .|0
where do i begin ? let me say that - - after having watched the entire film and the special features of the show , i did not expect to be intrigued by anything in this film . but i was ! i have never met a film like this . it really makes me think of a movie with some kind of plot . i mean how can you make movies like this at a decent hour when you ca n't even play a piano properly ? however , i found out that there is absolutely no chance of anyone being able to put up with all this crap .|0
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.|1
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. Even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.Unlike most HK actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and a roll-call of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery.|1
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club(this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans) I am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint. Afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves.The story is simple enough. In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. Luckily there's a few monkeys(chimpanzees) that have a bounty on their head that would get Boba Fett or Dog's(Duane Chapman) blood flowing.|1
The greatest movie ever.How's that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time.|1
While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying? ), but all in all and good time.|1
I can't believe I even tried to watch this filth. As an avid B-Horror movie fan, I was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, I could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of.|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward . . . granted i am a fan of the movie , but did i really believe that i would actually be seeing something like this ? how stupid could i be ? now i just have to go see it and wonder why it bothers me so much . it just does not seem to connect with any of the characters , other than some of them , who were at least as interesting to me during the movie as these guys are to everyone else .|0
"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" is a peculiar movie. Like I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors."|1
"""Yesterday"" as a movie, is hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film."|1
some describe caligulia as ` ` the ' ' most controversial film of its era . while this is debatable , it appears that there is some kind of literary conspiracy in it . the main reason i am interested in what they are doing is because i found a picture of a group of men arguing on a stage with three women . these two women are talking to each other . they have been trying to act like they know what they are saying when they are really saying things . they are not very good at acting , so all they want to do is sing .|0
i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara int ' l film festival . it is extremely absorbing and fascinating . what i will not understand is why someone would pay such a lot of money to make that film , because it was totally useless in the first place . you see , if you want to find a movie , you do n't have to spend an hour watching it . the actors seem to be from different families and they can easily pass for brothers . no one knows who they are or what they were up to with each other .|0
minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of henson ' s finest and most personal films . it may seem funny to call it a movie but you ' re probably not more than a minute away from doing just that ! in fact , he ' s never seen anything like it . the actors are usually very bad - tempered and extremely inept . at this stage of production , even i could see that this film might have something to do with all the unoriginality of the movie and how it was edited by a man who had nothing left to offer others .|0
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful ; it was pointless and just plain stupid . the plot was atrocious and the characters were too much like themselves . how could anybody know what to think about ? so , after listening to it several times , i realized that i really enjoyed it . if you liked it as much as i did , then this was a very good film ! i have n't seen it since 1975 and it has always been my favourite movie . for instance , on the day of the wedding , i left the house in the company of my parents and went looking for work .|0
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. The acting was over the top. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl.|1
i should have realized that any two - video set being sold for only $ 6 would be bad . i even saw this movie once about a woman and her boyfriend having sex in the same hotel room where they took the money from their families , after which they were kidnapped by a gang of terrorists . i really liked the film though , because it made me think that this is what one does when you love someone . do you love them ? i mean , no . i mean , sure . i could write a stupid review on youtube .|0
` ` son of the mask ' ' is a terrible excuse of a movie . i went to see this with a friend and learned that it was really rather funny . so i had to take a walk around the house to see whether i was missing something . the only thing that stuck in my mind was the ghost story , but there were two different movies . the first one was quite bad . it was very unfunny . however , the second one was really funny . the third movie was not nearly as funny , but you know what i mean ?|0
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvellous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score, and witty, light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous, the results are hilarious.|1
when a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of mayhem , constitute the main drama of this film ? i must say the movie is not only interesting but it is a real horror flick . i do n't actually read much about it , as i thought i would since i live in a small city in the north . but i know enough to think that this movie will be even more ridiculous if all the characters are completely nuts . i can not believe how stupid i was to take this crap seriously .|0
"Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! It's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s ""Hanna-Barbera"" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons!"|1
ok , i read the director ' s comment about this movie ( featured as the ' frontmost comment ' ) , and even though it was all a little stupid , i still find it funny . in the very beginning , there was a lot to laugh about but that ' s not why this movie is filmed . while it ' s good , it can get really boring . we just see some of the most boring scenes i ever saw and it has been so much fun . there ' s nothing like going to bed after a long night of relaxing with your friends and drinking too much .|0
"rowan atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr . bean who never goes far without his teddy bear . i ca n't say for sure , but i could see something like that happening . "" "" what are you talking about ? ' i asked my dad . "" how would a girl like this have met a boy like him in college and fallen in love with him after she got married ? did she ask him out or some such thing ? "" "" her parents had been divorced for almost fifty years . "" "" oh , come on , pete ."|0
the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog - eat - dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of interest in the case . we have all been warned that these guys are killers , but there is nothing i can say that makes them better men than gangsters . this movie seems to be really boring to watch and you can see why . at least i do n't hear about it from my best friends . i think i would rather just enjoy what i had while i had it . it was an interesting episode which ended with some bad guy being caught trying to kill his girlfriend .|0
well , i think i ' ve finally seen my last woody allen movie ! i read the review in the mail and i ' m quite impressed with the quality of the movie . it had a lot of character and depth , lots of dialogue and more plot than what i thought was proper for a classic . i have watched this movie many times over the years , and always thought it looked cool . i got the impression there was some serious drama going on at the scenes . you would think they would make it sound like a really terrible film or something , but no , nothing like that .|0
a potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving it like that . when this story is done , it does seem to improve the acting skills of some characters . if you can make an attempt to be the villain , there will be very few actors left after the book is over . but i ca n't really tell what they were in real life . who cares ? it was so much better before . why could n't this have been another one of those movies about the guy who goes into the city for money to pay off his gambling debts ?|0
"Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored Scorpion Mobile. She battles the evil Breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved the bit about her having to say ""Yo"" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! It's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion ""attacks"" her partner steals the show."|1
i was so excited to finally watch ` ` pulse ' ' after receiving it from amazon , and i have to admit i found the video interesting . of course , this movie does n't get me hooked on the idea of an indie film by any means , but i still wanted to try it out . there is no doubt that the film was not one of the best in the book , because the main characters were all dead . the dialogue was very mediocre , though the acting was very decent . i never knew this film was so bad for ratings .|0
"I'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first ""Road"" picture I've seen. I was expecting waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of the Road movies. If that's true I needn't bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.I didn't like the movie."|1
"since the past couple of days i ' m really hooked on the ` ` female scorpion ' ' series and i keep wondering whether or not there really is a human "" scorpion "" . but you ' ve been here for less than one hour , so if you want to go home , i can make sure that you wo n't find out where it is . in fact , you ' re going to find out very little about this place . i know it ' s not big enough to provide a lot of information at all . however , we ' ll try anyway ."|0
riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the la brea tar pits in los angeles . even if you attempt to take these things seriously and actually enjoy them , i find that there is nothing to be embarrassed about . it just looks so wrong . . . so very wrong . while i hate the idea of trying to do something completely different with this film , i will not have any part in it should it happen . we are on a first name basis as a married couple because we have been friends for too long .|0
This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. I did not laugh one time during the entire movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in America and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. I cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth caring about.|1
"Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? Great actors...Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `A List' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after having liked ""Angels & Insects"" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was."|1
this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half . few characters who make it into the movie actually have any idea what they are really going to be seeing on the screen , much less how to deal with the actors . if you have an interest in the plot , maybe you can start with two people playing in the same film together . do you think that will work ? not for long , but for at least a year ! this is one of the best movies i have ever seen .|0
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and I had read two books - 'A Voyage for Madmen' and 'The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst' before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece.|1
"i do n ' t know which was worse , the viewer ' s made dopes of , or the stars in this movie . "" "" what did he do to your head ? "" jason asked . "" how come no one knows it ' s going to get worse ? you ' re lucky there is a doctor living on this earth who can make these kinds of episodes look like a real horror film . even for some people . not all people , mind you . they just don ' t like to watch that sort of stuff ."|0
***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. But then came the rest of the movie. By the time it was over I was furious. Nothing was correct but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden.|1
This is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.Later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head.|1
i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane , it was easy to see that this was the work of a very good actor who was genuinely looking for someone to be his friend . he really enjoyed his acting but in truth he could n't figure out where the girl was being taken and if she had gone to one of the theaters or even anywhere close to the theater . the idea of trying to find her there made him laugh because he knew she would probably be at some hotel or other with friends .|0
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the Marx Brothers. And trust me, they are paid.As creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really have faith in this turkey. Rather, I think THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate STUDIO 60, which previously graced the peacock network's Monday night lineup.|1
I rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.It starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. Its called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? Well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.Then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst.|1
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son.|1
"This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.We see little long-haired Jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (I guess poor Jack attained the wrong kind)."|1
' helen of troy ' follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war . this is more or less the same thing i have been seeing for the last twelve years . i was not expecting it to be this good ; but then again , so much has happened that i doubt anyone in the history of the united states has even seen the film . there are several other documentaries on helen of troy which are quite interesting . i thought i was watching a bad movie in which someone gets killed in an explosion ( as they put it ) .|0
spoiler with plot explanation : a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy and his girlfriend . so , i guess it 's only fair to warn you about what they can be when they want to be . after all , we were raised to believe in the ' great american hero ' ( that is , if he had one ) . this movie was written at the time by a man who was very much into movies ; he actually has some good comedies from the 1930s and 40s , but did not like them because they made too much noise .|0
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis, he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing.|1
okay , i love this movie ! ! ! ! ! i watched it over and over again . it was the funniest movie i ever saw . one time i had a bad movie about someone who could see their own shadow in the room while they were looking through a mirror . they got really pissed at me because i made it look like i was doing an assignment on them . it was lame . even if it was funny . i mean , there was no other movie that would have looked like this scene . it was completely out of my price range for liking the movie .|0
This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th Century and early 21st. So when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about telling us that.Also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country.|1
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. BBC are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks.Ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written.|1
Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film.|1
Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes.|1
the recent release of ` ` mad dog morgan ' ' on troma dvd is disappointing . this appears to be a censored print out and it does not show what i want to find in this video . i would like to present you with one of my favorite movies about the movie but if it has been reprinted then it is totally unsalvageable . i hope that you have had a great day . i could use some more of those movies today ! i will try to see another movie this week , although i do not wish to be caught asleep for any reason .|0
"""The Dresser"" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the ""energetic"" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."|1
i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell.|1
i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life , and each time i watch it the theme seems to be a little slower . i had no idea that most of the movies would be so lame . however , this movie is definitely a waste of time for me . if you are into all that high school shit , you know that it does not count as being bad . what i really get about this book is that it is an american novel and not a horror movie . why did these people ever write this book ? i have no idea .|0
It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.|1
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson. This film was not it. It was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely awful. Her acting was so bad it was like watching an A1 airhead trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice grated the nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius.|1
I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.|1
"hello all ! i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew maniratnam would ' ve given an excellent film , not that there was much to go around . i was disappointed that he had taken the time to pay a small fee to get it on film . i have no idea which one of my characters or where they are being sent to so i was very disappointed at the end and wanted to do some more filming in order to put an end to this horrible movie . however , when we got back to the house and saw it was still on tv , i was disappointed again .

this is an account of events that have been covered in print several times , and i had read two of them , one in the late fifties and two in early 1970 . it is hard to believe that these three people could have anything in common , let alone a shared past which would lead us to think that there could be some truth to what was being told here today . at the very least it was something worth seeing , if not actually paying attention to . as for the other thing i heard on the radio just prior to this presentation , i did n't see any of those movies .|0
Actually, Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is no where on par for CGI, but I would give it the same vote.Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role.|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point. If your expecting fast cars, T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this, you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think.|1
"this movie baffled me . i could not get a grip on it . thought i might be missing something because of all the years i have worked with this movie ! well , at least i did n't see it before . i was very disappointed about it . if you can tell people that you ' ve never watched "" horror "" when you ' ve seen it , they probably think you didn ' t do so well . there were some really lame acting attempts but no great plot or any real dialogue . even the characters looked as though they had been out for a week ."|0
OK, I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I did see the movie, so I figured I would leave a comment on it. I just love once again how Joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. It seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities.|1
It looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. The film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. May god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new one and only reason why I never will want to see (or trust) an Australian made film again.|1
"i actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it ' s even worse . "" "" that was great ! "" heather said as she laughed at beth .

"" "" yeah , me either "" i said shaking my head , but i could see that it is going to be interesting . i wonder what everyone thought of the movie ? did they enjoy watching the movie ?"|0
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top.|1
"i am utterly astonished at how over - rated ` ` cemetery man ' ' is among horror fans ! now , i usually hate this movie , especially when you make it "" on stage . but the thing with this movie is that not only is it awful , it sounds really bad . it has a few comedies that are just about as good as any other horror movie i 've ever seen , and they are just so depressing to watch that it makes you want to stay home and watch old movies instead of watching them right away because there is nothing wrong with them ."|0
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid plotline, and the ever-predictable outcome. About the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women (and the mute guy for you ladies) in it. The leader of the warrior women and Valeria are quite appealing to the eye. But that's about all this movie has going for it.Some silliness in point: One scene, when they start to journey to the lair of the Dark One, they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land.|1
( this is a review of the later english release by disney , featuring alison lohman , patrick stewart , and robert ledford . ) in addition to reading it , i can not remember when i took the book from its setting or even when i found it out . the story about the movie was pretty good , and the character was interesting , but there was one thing i could not stand . it was not a love triangle between the couple , the plot was slightly off . it was not just the two of them fighting each other for their lives .|0
This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been out on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery (the movie, although taking place in and around Virginia, was filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie (including a boat that I've worked on).|1
"1. The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. Ken Shamrock is in it. 3. Ken Shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. It leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. The makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like. ""Just give him a $30 mask."" ""Good enough for me."" 6."|1
"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film ""Howl's Moving Castle"". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold."|1
"monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies , mainly because of the fact that it is supposed to be "" a beautiful film . "" however , it appears to be no different than any other movie you have seen , and from the perspective of anyone who has seen it . if you have been through this experience before , then know that most people are not quite what you expected they might be . when you get a chance to read this , try to understand the real reasons behind this film so you can come to grips with it ."|0
emilio estevez actually directed a good movie - - who woulda thought ? i sat through two previous films estevez directed . they were both great but this was the one that got me in trouble . this movie was about a girl who was trying to save a friend from a horrible man . she was trying very hard but the worst part was that there was no sign of her . the heroine had a broken hand , and she was being led to a hospital . this movie is really bad when it comes to horror film , and estevez ' character does n't even understand what he is supposed to be watching !|0
The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.The movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town.|1
"This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. It is clear from the start that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. I think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. Sean Bean ""acted"" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was."|1
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included).|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars. Quite a statement for a film I'd never heard of...though why I should have taken any notice of a TV announcer, I don't know. In the event, said announcer was talking tripe.It's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' awful Burr-ming-gum accent. Can't see any advantage in it being set in the Midland's anyway. Unresolved threads abound...and I wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense.|1
tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . the acting , directing and script are all so unsatisfying . i just do n't think we should allow these characters to get away with anything . it is a total failure . the plot is too horrible . i have never seen such poorly conceived action sequences at any of the movies i have ever seen . the actors seem to be in their mid - twenties , but i suspect that was only because they had no experience . i wish i had some footage of the film to look at for my next interview .|0
"One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and Judgement Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.Actually, good candidates for a real Third Testament have been published several times - like ""A Course in Miracles"" or ""Conversations with God""."|1
' do n ' t look in the basement ' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that brownrigg is really not a nice guy , he 's actually one of the meanest people i 've ever known and i guess this makes it even worse because when you are dealing with a person like him you see them all the time . his wife is very beautiful , there is no denying that she is beautiful and good looking but she just does n't want to give her children an opportunity to become rich and have any sort of success in life or for that matter anywhere on earth .|0
I really don't know why I'm writting this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this:When I first get done watching some movies, I like them. Then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So, to resolve this, I watched it again at a friends house. Well, it's bad.I'm a logic person.|1
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times Jacqueline rubs herself, the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good.|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories.|1
Bad, bad, and did I mention bad? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT director!The only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on Clara Bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the Bone Eater rides on.|1
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film. Trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.There were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and Kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. This just looked like filler.Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and seeing an IBM techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it.|1
to start with , i have done some further research on the film . firslty , jules dassin directed and edited the film . in my defense , i am a very poor writer . i made most of the reviews but it was pretty bad . after i got my first book published i found myself waiting for a sequel to come out . the story is so sad , i can hardly wait to leave this place and start over somewhere else . i hate that movie . however , i ca n't stop looking back on it and wonder why the hell i even bothered to watch it .|0
The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters?|1
I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt.|1
"Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made ""Bamako,"" but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.The nominal ""plot"" involves a young African singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. But far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as ""a mock trial against key financial institutions"" dealing ""with the overwhelming economic hardships of Africa."""|1
"eh . this is a popcorn movie , nothing more . i watched this with a bunch of friends ( including my daughter ) and it was funny but i just could n't see the big deal . the first thing i saw in this movie ' s film was people walking through the mall at christmas and then going into that store . i mean there were a lot of people in there , all dressed up in the best outfits . it was so depressing . anyway , for example , someone said to me , "" hey , look at this movie "" ."|0
jess franco makes exploitation films , and he has made tons of them . franco is responsible for some of the worst - quality movies ever made in history . i am so disgusted with him . there are no decent movies on the screen . it is not fair ! all of these movies were terrible . well , except for one . the movie is about a young man who had sex with his wife while at work . then he decides to turn around and walk away without making any comment about it . it is horrible . i wish i knew what kind of thing went on behind the scenes .|0
why could n ' t the end of the movie have been sean connery ' s men fighting the french instead of the nazis ? as if i wanted to watch these movies ! they are too depressing . in the end , i decided to see them for myself . it ' s a beautiful film , just like the ones i saw on my kindle . i wish i didn ' t like the idea of this movie because the acting is great , but i was sure that would be the start of much more interesting reading material . here ' s another bad example .|0
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995, I dismissed it offhand, saying that Julie was no Daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid.But here it is, 5 years later, its on Disney and im watching it again. And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as I made it out to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever. And Swank's character isnt that bad, her acting is pretty good considering the script.|1
"This movie is funny in more ways than one. It's got action. It's got humour. It's got attitude. It's got Dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! And that's just what the movie offers as a film. It's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some ""punches"" miss by feet. But when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those ""details""? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it..."|1
When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory.|1
"I have never seen this in the theater, my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.Hitch's pallet here is the ""game play"" between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice?"|1
eddie monroe is hooooot . he is a great actor and i could be his girl anytime . he ' s just the sort of star - crossed romance movie that makes me gag . i am really looking forward to seeing him in it . so what do you like about this movie ? why are these guys so special to us ? i was thinking there should be some type of soundtrack for this movie , but nothing is to be seen . the film has a long , boring ending with the main characters getting all hot and heavy . i never thought that this would ever happen to an adult .|0
a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore . however , it still does the trick . i just could n't believe this is going to work . at least some of the characters are well - dressed , and the actors seem to know what they are doing when they go on stage . it was one thing to have two actors from opposite directions , but this is the worst kind of production you can put your fingers on . i do n't see why the script had to turn into this crap !|0
like the previous two ' mad max ' films , ' mad max beyond thunderdome ' is not exception to the violence . i have to say , this movie has a bit of an action - thriller aspect in it , but i guess there was no way that i could tell anyone about this film . and besides , i am really glad that it had been edited into format . i do n't even mind the editing . what i really enjoy are the screenplays . as much as you may doubt this one , it 's still a great movie .|0
A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel).|1
` ` the man from utah ' ' opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback . this is how he introduces himself and i like it . the actors are great and they play an amazing piece of music . you will have to watch that movie , as the plot is very bad for the fans , but the director is so talented that it is funny . it was a good idea , even though it did not seem to me at the time . however , when i looked over the previous night 's script in the late afternoon , i thought it was a bad idea because of what had happened .|0
"i thought i was going to see a ufo movie . instead , i saw a movie that was trying to kill me . 
 "" oh , god ! "" i said , not knowing what else to say . it had been so long since i had fun watching something like this that i almost forgot how annoying it can really be . i turned on my ipod and sat down in the tub to watch some of the movies . while i watched one of them , i got ready for bed . by the time i entered the bedroom , i could tell that everything was okay ."|0
nothing really unpredictable in this movie , but a solid flick in all respects . everything from acting to cinematography . i think the main character is one of the biggest actors that ever lived , and it was made as if someone else has been doing this movie before . not exactly cool , but you ca n't blame a kid for wanting to make something of themselves , no matter how small . there is an element of arrogance about those who do what they can to get ahead . after the first few months , i had to laugh at my parents ' choice of films .|0
after reading some of these reviews , it is apparent that some have missed the point . what is great about this book ? i can tell that you enjoy reading it , but to be fair , i just ca n't say why . let 's go back to the beginning when the author of this book said that the book was a bad idea and should be written by its owner . he never bothered to mention that the book would need a lot of money , so the author could simply leave the script alone . well , not completely .|0
In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).His camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist.|1
this is my favourite film and i think it is perfect . unlike virtually any other film i can name , which includes the most unromantic and depressing movie of the time . you will learn more about your friend in a half hour than should be possible . if you have not heard of the plot yet or do not care to watch it , please give me a call right away and we will see what you think . but first let me tell you that this is pretty bad . i hope you enjoy the whole film .|0
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. Since that time, we rate movies based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. It isn't worth a second look that's for sure.|1
i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts , and to be honest , i did n ' t know what a driver was supposed to do with them . this was so weird i thought they were just meant for movie stars or some such nonsense . it made me even more uncomfortable . one of the other guys who was playing the music at the time came up asking me if i would like to join him on the game . in fact , he was the one who had recommended the play . i knew it would not be fun .|0
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I thought it looked very entertaining. Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time.|1
"If I had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful I've seen it'd be this one. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. The movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either-I've seen depressing ""thriler"" type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. Vanishing didn't have that, This was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie."|1
this movie is not so good as i thought it would be . there is no story whatsoever , no plot at all . the character - in a very real way - looks like someone you would expect to see at one of your movies . the character does n't seem to realize that she is going to be watching a different movie . for example , while the movie starts with a woman trying to find her father 's killer in his backyard , and then begins by taking pictures , he gets confused , turns around and goes to the neighbor to ask if he can get any money for an ice cream cone .|0
Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots Piper, who dies.|1
"this is my favorite renoir from the fifties . it ' s the story of how henri danglard built and launched an atomic submarine . he has a long history with nuclear weapons as far as i can tell , but i do not know if it was designed to save humanity or kill him off . i don ' t really want to know . this is the worst show on television . we watch in silence for several minutes until there are no other sounds left to be heard . "" oh , this is awful , "" she says , then sits back against the couch and looks out the window at the ocean . """|0
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen (with the exception of this and Affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way.|1
first off , i ' m amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site . i hope it doesn ' t come out again . anyway , i was surprised to find this movie at all . i don ' t think i could have ever expected such an unsuitable movie - and it ' s a total waste of time - but it ' s not so bad in the way you would expect . i thought we were going to get to know each other well , and i really liked this movie . there are two things i want to share with you .|0
I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons.Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.This movie.|1
"Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional Navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the U.S. Navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).Director David S. Ward (""Major League"") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well."|1
this film is really really bad , it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at originality . if you ask me ( i was n't there ) , even the most amazing thing i would like to do is watch it with my daughter . she is good too , i think that is what caused her to be such a pain in the ass . maybe it was because of all the years of living up to her own name . however , i have been looking forward to seeing how she will come out from the closet .|0
i honestly do n ' t know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review , as a result the author makes an exception when he discusses the topic . you would have thought by now that people who live in this area are supposed to know enough about it to be able to appreciate all the things it shows on tv and read the reviews . no one could have guessed the real reason why most of their movies are so funny . it is also quite obvious to me that they only ever really saw the title of one movie because there is a sequel to the original .|0
"This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the ""good"" sister is just silly. It is Anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not Mary's, that has been told so often.In response to an earlier review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so ""criminal""... to me it's Henry who was the real criminal."|1
of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone . even i do n't get the story because i ca n't make out how it can possibly be an accurate account . but , there are only two ways that such a novel is written . one is by those who are interested in its content . the first ( and i mean truly the greatest ) is that each person should read it and try to understand why they would choose to enjoy it as much as they did .|0
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it? ""Return to Me"" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!)"|1
if you put seinfeld aside , this is the best comedy ever , no doubt ! just great ! ` ` but i ' ve been watching too many movie reviewers to really believe this one . it ' s pretty lame , and i ' m always afraid that it ' s a complete waste of my valuable time and effort . there is so little to be done when you ' re talking to someone like this . we ' ll have to sit back and watch this movie for awhile and try to figure out what makes it so bad .|0
roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low - budget career , spanning over 300 movies . and i am the last person who might be wondering just how much he could possibly gain from such a small enterprise . while there are some critics who argue that it is very difficult for anyone to make this movie into something even marginally worth making , you may think that this movie is an example of how little any of them can actually hope to do . at least when you see it , you can see the good times and the bad times .|0
This film wasn't good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever.|1
First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is most certainly a film worth one's while, but one is left sorely puzzled at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for whose beyond himself); or was the Colonel not a fraud, but used as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest Colonel?|1
"this film follows the life of a great guitar player , who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly , with nothing to give and no idea as to what he is playing . if you are reading this , you do not know him . i can not believe anyone would even bother to read this movie . this is so stupid . why could n't it be about something else ? ! there had to be something good in it . here goes nothing . 
 ' oh shit ' was the first thing on my mind ."|0
"11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. See this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying ""There's lots of mysteries out there."" followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield."|1
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire.|1
wow ! after the first five minutes of watching this ` ` film ' ' , i was quite tempted to put it down . unfortunately , there are so many scenes where the actors go off at random and try to work out a way to get the actors to behave correctly , that some of us think it is very possible that they can succeed . we all agree that the whole idea is crazy . it is extremely frustrating to watch a movie like this without having to be able to make up your mind what you are going to do or not do .|0
if you enjoy riddles and suspense , you will enjoy this movie . truth be told it was mostly the latter . in the second half of the series i was able to turn a little bit of my money into a few good stories about characters and character . i have never done a lot of writing before because of all the things that happened in the movie . there is a whole list of bad movies that i know nothing about . i had to make a couple of films to get by until i found one that would be worth watching .|0
Reba is a very dumb show. You can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who resembles a real-life person. I guess Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba.|1
This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge, the Sargent, the kid, the creepy old lady, the slut, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way... never give your patient an ax! This was before Cukkos Nest, AND surpasses it.|1
if you ' re a long - time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series of movies , i can see why . there is so much to admire about films . it seems that people will spend their entire lives on them , and no matter who is in or out , each movie goes on with something as different as its own character . i just wish i could say that this film does not appeal to me . it makes me feel tired . it has a horrible quality . i am too tired to do anything about it today .|0
this formulaic film ( hero ' s girlfriend marries the villain ) just did n ' t move along fast enough given some time and effort . there wasn ' t a good story on the screen and i wanted to take it apart , see what it could possibly contain , which was n't much to look at - but it wasn ' t all that impressive , either . i ' d seen a documentary on an old tv show and had no intention of watching another one until i was well into my first season . the plot was bad but i don ' t really pay attention to it .|0
` ` solomon and sheba ' ' was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in 1967 . it 's as if the movie is being broadcast for an endless period of time without any idea at all of what it actually is going to be about . i do not even think there could be more than a dozen words in the text , much less half that amount of dialogue . it is not difficult to understand where the plot is taking place : it is one of those blockbuster movies where you know this is something you would like to see .|0
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. He is often alone and used to it. He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters who speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is.|1
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. I found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. I'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. With everyone else getting killed, all through the movie I wondered why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brains out.|1
six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing . now , eighteen years later , it 's all happening again , in this very same way . and i am one of the last to see her . on the day she dies , i think about getting out of this town forever . i would not go near any of those places for fear of getting caught . but there has been too much death already , and too many deaths . you could have lost an innocent sister and two children in a single day .|0
my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for agliff ( a film festival where all of us go to buy drugs . ) they were very funny . i felt so sorry for the guy who went out with her . his girlfriend , however , made him laugh every time he was near her because it seemed to make him laugh too much . even though she knew this movie would suck , i think she just liked it . after the show , everyone began to get up from the couch and talk about what to do if they did not like it .|0
"OK....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted info on the front. I am a programmer from a North American fest, and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away Moscow/Karlovy Vary interface.Straight away I thought ""this film is not for us"" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. Well, well, well."|1
"""Hardbodies 2"" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add ""brainless"" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in ""The Big Doll House"")."|1
one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore , ` ` ten cents a dance ' ' stars barbara stanwyck as a beautiful , well - dressed woman ' . . . you will never be sure which one made it . for some reason there was always an edge to the film . i still do n't understand why that movie was so awful . it was just wrong . no , i do n't think it was wrong , exactly , it just was n't worth making fun of at all . but what really made it sad was that it was a good song .|0
What crack are you smoking? This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! The action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, I just about peed myself. I could go on...Entertaining, arguably so. Good, no. Well made, certainly not.As a commentary on America as empire, it's actually pretty good.|1
this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . definitely not a well made movie . i could n't wait to get home and see my father , if only to see how much he hated this movie . there were a number of places that i wanted to see but one that i did not even want to find . it was just too horrible to contemplate seeing the movie . i knew it should make me laugh , but it simply would not . what kind of character does that ? it just is not worth it !|0
I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to.|1
"this movie was a major bait and switch . i rented it because of rebecca st . james , a popular author in the late forties and early forties who has been in the business of becoming famous for his movies . after he ' s been on tv for years , people start wanting to make him an offer . they ' re never going to get anything out of him that will allow him to write much of his personal life . "" "" do you know how he got off the set of this movie without being caught ? "" i asked as i took a sip of my water .

"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story."|1
...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves.|1
i watched 5 % of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie over again . i ca n't believe my eyes when i saw it . how could people watch their own movies , no matter what they have in their life ? a film can be really boring as it has nothing to do with the person or anything . but if you want to watch some of the worst horror flicks ever , look for this one at your favorite restaurant . oh yeah , it 's all right by me , because there is a very interesting story here .|0
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by MST3K.George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated, overly-theatrical performances I've ever seen.|1
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. I loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until I saw Bugged...WHAT HAPPENED?This Movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker.|1
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui.|1
You know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can't look away? This movie isn't that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit.|1
The reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about moses, God was staying out of it. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also the people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it, It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again.|1
the first thing you should know about ` ` zipperface ' ' is that it was shot on video , so it looks really bad . but there is no need to be dramatic about this . for example , i saw one of the most gruesome movie theatres i have ever seen - a very gory and unsatisfying movie . anyway , after the movie ended , the producers did not want any publicity . they said it was a waste of money . my favorite movie in all the world has always been an action / romance . now , film is like some kind of art museum .|0
though i have watched salo , i do not know if excrement tastes tart . if it does , this is the best i have seen in a while . all of them are bad , except one . the man who made me watch these films was a complete dick . i wish i had never seen them . they did not really make much of a show for the first few years . maybe they were just boring , but now i am going to buy them as soon as i figure out how to get them off the shelf .|0
are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen ' s everyday ' s life ? is it possible to intrude upon their lives and have a little fun ? in any other story i would like to introduce you to the author and his family , but not because he is a big fan of your works . the story is very short so i will make this brief . the protagonist is a local high school jock who has made a lot of mistakes in the past , and probably still has a hard time making up his mind when it comes to the future .|0
"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy ""Chainsaw massacre""-feeling, everything falls apart.SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these ""fooled-ya""-movies can figure this out.This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind."|1
there ' s only one thing i ' m going to say about cat in the hat . . . as a kids movie . this was not a particularly bad movie , mostly because it wasn ' t very depressing . i found it hard to believe that cats were the main reason why they existed , and the fact that no one else could make out what they said made it worse than any other time i had been in it . the first part felt really bad , but at the end of it , i decided i would just watch it without having to listen to anyone talk .|0
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling.|1
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! !This beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. This one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?I give this a 10 out of 10!|1
"when a movie ' s claim to fame is that martin sheen ' s younger , less known brother stars in it . he got into some trouble over it and ended up being banned from acting . this movie was all about people trying to save themselves from themselves . i read something like this once , only it does n't do any good . the only thing that will get a guy through this is a few lines of "" one of my most hated moments ever written ! "" and there ' s nothing anyone can do about it . the plot is too horrible even to consider ."|0

I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does.|1
mel welles , you might remember him as mr . mushnick in roger corman ' s little shop of horrors , directs people with their guns to fire on the targets . it is not that they are bad shots , or that they are very dangerous , but for one reason or another , most of them will have to go off and shoot a lot of guns before they will be able to hit target - wise any targets at all . however , there has been plenty of times in the last few months when i thought this would be a good movie and i am positive this movie would be the best .|0
tart is the worst movie i ' ve seen this year , and that includes both the affleck / j . lo bomb gigli and john wayne are so good , you could actually make it as a film without even having to turn on the lights . and yes , i know i ' m getting off track here , but can you imagine if you watched a movie where every time one of the actors gets into a scene where someone is acting like a crazy person , they don ' t get away with it either ?|0
* * * may contain spoilers * * * * i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my husband and a bunch of other kids from my high school . this film takes me back to the day that i saw the horror film . we were at a family dinner and i could not find any fault with the movie . i remember looking into my son and daughter ' s eyes and trying to imagine what they did for fun in it . i just wanted to ask him about what he did on his lunch break after work but knew that he would not be able to make an answer .|0
a horrendous film , ill - conceived and crude . the acting of anne heche and vince vaughan is so inferior to what most of this film portrays it would probably be easy to convince me i do n't really want to see this movie . also there is no obvious way that the movie will get better in the book . the plot is bad enough , without having to have one of the best shots of the movie . the script is completely atrocious . even the director is a total douche . i can not comprehend why they ever built such a great movie .|0
this movie is a mystery . it ' s not scary , it ' s spooky . you ' ll probably jump at the chance to read it , but i ' ve seen lots of movies in my life and they are just as much fun . it ' s not a bad film . why should it be awful ? well , it is really rather boring , and the actors are so lame . . . i don ' t like this one any more than you guys do . it ' s pretty depressing and does nothing to distract me from feeling sorry for myself .|0
if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man ' s testicle , or look at a row of pathetically small children in front of a television - which are the only places on earth that we can watch . not to mention the fact i ca ' t even remember the last time i ' m bored . i ' ve got to say , it ' s nice to have company this time of year , but when you first start doing what you ' re called , there ' s too much of it to concentrate on the real world .|0
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics.|1
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie . the girls were lame and pathetic , i could have seen this one for the next ten minutes . i mean , what was the worst thing i could see in there ? how could they make it a real movie when all they do is mess around on stage ! i had to say that these two are worse than some of the other dumb movies ever produced . so i am going to go ahead and bring this movie up because i ca n't get enough of it . let me just start at the beginning .|0
without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made . period ! ! yes , it ' s worse than most movies that have just finished and i ' m very happy to see that this is the one i ' ve chosen for myself in this first year . as usual , it ' s not like i can actually watch it . i ' ve seen too many movies , but never before has such a beautiful , sexy film turned me off by just watching it . i ' m sure i ' ll be able to watch it over and over again until my eyeballs explode if i do not watch it .|0
please do not blame korea for this bad movie . i am in korea ( please excuse bad english ) and i just found out i am gay . oh , man , this is the worst movie i have ever seen ! if you would like to go back and watch this movie , please do not bother me . while i was watching it with my wife , she was very ill . there were all sorts of things that could have gone wrong . i did n't read much of it , but i heard an article on the subject when i was reading a book about some kind of thing .|0
"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. ""You Are Alone"" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!!"|1
I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Take about stage presence! There seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away.|1
"in ` ` red letters ' ' , coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a teacher about his life in korea ' . for example , he says : "" i did n't go back to korea because i was not interested in becoming a doctor like my friends do with the rest of them . i stayed because there was an interesting film called ' the great american discovery ' which i know nothing about . by the time you get to see that , you may be able to understand it and even learn a few facts about it ."|0
solo is an action movie about a terminator - like android that is constructed and trained for the military . when a few years ago , they were able to use the gun to commit suicide , but then was taken down by the united states marines . the real problem with such a cowardly act was that it only did it half a dozen times , and every time it happened , it always ended well . i think you can understand how my life would have gone differently had we not been there to see it go down so badly . it was awful , absolutely terrible .|0
i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute , a feel good saturday night movie but instead i saw this awful episode where a man and a woman who have an affair are being forced to spend a few minutes together . the guy has a beautiful wife and two beautiful children as well . it is obvious they have gotten married in their own small way . that 's why i did n't like it . what does it really get you ? was it so bad of me to think that there was going to be some sort of relationship between these two great men ?|0
has this ever happened to you ? i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals . they were very pretty , and i told them that i was not sure of what i thought they looked like but then i heard that one of them had been killed by an automobile accident at a construction site . if you ask me how it could have happened , i would have been more impressed . however , i really do believe there is some truth to this ' movie ' as i have seen so many movies about men trying to get into a woman 's pants in the dark .|0
It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.|1
"As a Genghis Khan ""fan"" I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens epic novels about Genghis and reading up on loads of historic records I feel I know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...That turned out a deception. This movie is practically made up from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring."|1
"Something not-so-great. ""Silence of the Lambs"" remains Demme's only good film, and I'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which I haven't seen - and never will.This is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. The first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. His animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny."|1
"This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors (""Death On The Nile"", ""Evil Under The Sun"") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat."|1
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this film is equally good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived.Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. There are no parents; they are on their own surviving. Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself.|1
i have heard that novo was compared to memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from a terrible disease . it also seems like this movie had something in common , so i decided i needed to get close and watch the first film . what i found out when i entered this place was that at least part of the films are more believable than the others . if you look closely enough at the actors , you can see that they are acting as though they are being led by an unseen hand . this is actually very interesting but does nothing to improve my initial enjoyment of this film .|0
"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and aired. I would ask the producers, ""What were you thinking? Were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?"""|1
Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year-olds (and I) loved it. Kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it.|1
as i watched this movie , i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head . i tried hard to look away from the movie but could not do it . i sat down at a table next to the exit doors and looked around desperately for a place to get out of the booth . unfortunately , what i saw was an empty booth near the door that looked like it would have been perfect for another movie , so i decided to walk to it . as i stepped outside , i saw two men on motorcycles parked along the side of the building .|0
"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful."|1
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!)|1
while out divining for water , a young psychic woman named jessica burns ( carolyn kearney ) stumbles upon something of this sort . one day , just after school , she walks in to a guy who is cheating on her with the same woman who cheated on him and the two are caught by the other woman . she finds out everything about the cheating couple , but only has the strength to take it off the wall . instead of thinking about what they are going through that should make them go crazy , she just feels sad about how poor things can be because of their mistakes .|0
. . . out of this movie . sorry to say , this showed at the cleveland international film festival . our copy did not give a good run for time ; i do not recommend this film as one that can be used to justify its production . it is only a little over three years old but looks nothing like what i expected . i could have been more prepared to watch this movie than i was with this one , but i had no idea . i would have loved to have seen it on a regular basis , but i think you may have missed out on that opportunity .|0
Realistic Master-Piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I never saw in my whole life a film like this one. First time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction... And It didn't looked like... That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It's the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down.|1
I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was OK, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside US. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. The screenplay is horrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles.|1
the third entry in the ` ` stepford ' ' franchise , but apparently the three made - for - tv obscure sequels are incredibly obscure . it 's just too hard to make heads or tails of this . anyway , you can go and get some more reading done . i 'll see what i can find out about these other characters . do n't be shy . i think i 'm already well acquainted with some of those people , although not really very much . i met them several months back in an attempt to stop them from writing a book they would have taken to bed in the first place .|0
this film flopped miserably in the uk , and it did n ' t deserve to . the trailer of this film is a disaster , and i would not recommend it to any of my friends . i think you should have read the other reviews that were released . there is nothing quite like having your best friend say things like that . if you love this film , please do not put it on the website . if you do not , please leave it off ! i am sorry , it is one of the most boring movies that i have seen in my entire career .|0
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film.|1
"I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting, and thought ""hmm, can't be too bad."" Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was ""not too good"".Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."|1
i love ustinov ' s distinctive , literate narration . and the photography is quiet nice . we put the film together for a horror film that is just not in the same genre . the only thing that gave me pause was the movie as to why they chose it . now , i believe there is no reason or reason why this movie should be any more interesting than the one before , but here you are going to feel like you have died and gone back to life again . at least i hope this is true .|0
for the first time in reviewing films , i found myself immediately uninterested in this story . i do n ' t like horror movies . it makes me feel like i have no control of my own life . what is so special about one film ? well , it is kind of awesome . the premise was bad and terrible , with the writer acting out his words in such a manner that i thought it was an attempt to make a good film . i did n't think it was a movie at all . not only was the dialogue mediocre , but there was just no rhyme or reason to what they were doing .|0
"Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? There is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that I found this ""movie"" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and POORLY ACTED. I admire them for the try, but the ""actors"" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I did not have that option, so it gets a 1."|1
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.|1
i ' ll give it a two because it has a lot of music , otherwise it would be a one . i ' ll also give it a couple of songs that you don ' t like at all , so make sure to read the first three out loud for me while i ' m doing this . i hope you enjoy the book . if you do , please leave a review on amazon as well , or any online site where you might want to put a review . if you do , send your best comments about the characters and content of this book .|0
For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. If each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love.|1
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. It is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny.|1
anne ( natalie portman ) tells us about how much she hates her mother , adele ( susane sarandon ) , and how that made her mom . the story is somewhat funny , since it was the only time we saw each other throughout the whole thing , but i doubt anyone else finds it funny . my parents were completely oblivious to the tragedy happening in our family while they sat at the breakfast table with a big bowl of hot cocoa and some cheesy french fries , watching an infomercial on their tv set . there was no one who looked as though they ought to be watching this , either .|0
i missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week . this movie will be the first i 've seen in a few months and that is saying something since most of the movies have n't even been released yet . if you want to know the answer , go to the video store and pick up another book . there are tons of them available so just leave it on the shelf . if you like this movie what do you think of this movie ? please check the titles . i love horror movies ; they are great for both entertainment and inspiration .|0
last night , i saw a peck on the cheek ( kannathil muthamittal with english subtitles ) . oddly , there was also this kiss that made me feel like i had to put my fingers through a wire to try to catch a glimpse of what she really looked like . but even though i 'm not a very romantic person , i guess you can assume that i was in an awkward position for a few moments after the kissing scene . when i thought it over , i realized that i had no idea what her eyes looked like from the outside .|0
"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits."|1
i have always liked the carry on films , with their double - meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy ; but this film will never make it . i am sure that there is a little part of me that wants to keep going and see if any of this will even come off in my book . the problem is that the original was such a flop , that it has become a complete waste of time . as i say , when i first read about this movie , i was appalled by how awful the title was .|0
as over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so - called sitcoms ( actually only a few actors are in it ) , but this movie is really very bad . it just goes from bad to worse and all that . if you have no idea what this movie should look like , then i am not sure you need to ask . it looks like a series of horror films on tv . there is no sign of an actual plot anywhere . it just seems like everyone has some sort of plan . well , almost everyone .|0
Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However, I think there is some other problems here.1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e.|1
"Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course ""no question about it"" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like ""extremely boring"" or ""nothing happened"" ""a complete waste of time"". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening."|1
Oh, dear! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. I wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him.|1
This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced USA drama. The characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.Just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. I guess it was no a low budget film. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. Maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.No more hope in cinema...|1
` ` graduation day ' ' is a result of the success of ` ` friday the 13th . ' ' both of those movies had an effect on the young boy , but it was not enough to change him into a robot or make him into something else . his personality seemed to transform and alter at the same time : his voice changed , his actions evolved , his sense of reality deteriorated , and then he just started talking as if you / he / she were speaking in tongues . i am sorry to have warned you , but it was a bad film .|0
it ' s almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors : red without borders and green with white . i ' d like to thank all my friends and family who helped me , but they didn ' t know how to tell me how much i wanted to be the star . i think some of that was due to being an author , but by the end of this book i was so tired from writing that i just put the book away . i can ' t believe i was so stupid as to write such a dirty book .|0
Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence.|1
My grandad gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. What a bloody mistake.Basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.The first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.The DVD case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained.|1
an absolute classic of 80 ' s scare flix . this one is n ' t like any other as it pits pint - size characters who are a few years too old and are completely incapable of writing . although i have seen this film with the help of movies , i still did not believe in it at first . it is so cheap that you can see all kinds of movie trailers about what happened and how it turns out . i knew it would be easy to watch , but for some reason , i just could not put my finger on why .|0
when this show first came to disney , i love it started watching all the time . it quickly became a real disappointment and i am glad to say that it ' s still great . i could ' t tell you how many of my favorite shows i ' ve watched , though i did read some of the reviews on the internet before coming here . i have been looking forward to this episode ever since its first release in 2013 , and i can remember watching the movie myself as a child . there are so many funny characters at the time but they were very different than i had imagined .|0
"I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ""Ethan Mao"" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I am going to give away a key element to the ""plot"". After holding his family hostage overnight, Ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - ALONE!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the cops! Wow ... what a twist!"|1
i mean really , really , really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment . i do n ' t care what you say as long as it shows some good acting . the thing about being a cop is that every movie has a bad character . we have to try to be patient and remember who is doing the driving . there is so many people involved with this one that i am not sure when or how they will all go out of their way to get away from the characters . i think they just like taking pictures of each other in different places and sometimes on the couch .|0
I hate to admit it, but they were right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone.|1
"Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching ""Amilie"". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.The story is great and the ending is a bit funny."|1
admittedly , when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie , my expectations were pretty low . as you can imagine , i did n't believe anything could be more awful . if it had been a real movie , i would have been surprised . that was just not how hollywood worked . even in the early part of the 21st century , it was difficult to take in the basic details of the film . we found it hard to believe that it was made at all . the entire production was basically one big fat joke .|0
I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera.|1
"I expected a lot more out of this film. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. Bottom line is that ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier.I really like Grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing. The character is designed well, but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think that his character was explained too well. I mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to become a woman."|1
what to say about this movie ? a married couple has more then just each other . after playing around in bed , they finally break up and have sex . but it ends badly , which sucks . i really want to see the movie , but i know that would be pointless . there is no action in this movie . however , at the end of the film , i can see why the guy who was cheating on his girlfriend with her best friend gets dumped by the love of his life . how does he manage to make it through the rest of his days without kissing his wife and having sex ?|0

Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin.|1
steven segal has done some awful films , but this is probably one of the best since his career took off . i just wish i could have seen it again a few years ago and not missed it at all . now i can see how an old - fashioned movie like this will come in handy . let 's see if we can really find a great movie to replace the one that is currently playing . first of all , the characters are all wrong , although i am sure my ex - husband was exaggerating about how bad they look . well , there you go .|0
"It's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even by that low standard this is a terrible film.Essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you're an ""Alan Smithee"" fan, avoid this one."|1
this movie was probably one of the worst movies i ' ve seen in a very long time . a friend of mine told me that he saw it in the middle of 1973 and it ' s not that bad . i actually had to watch it for the film . after all , what else could i do ? it ' s funny how the best part of the film is your name being mentioned by some people you didn ' t know before . the most interesting part about this movie is that although it ' s an awful movie , even the characters are pretty good .|0
hello all Denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! This show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. Among Denver are other favourite too, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. It is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite.|1
this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time . spilsbury lacks energy to say the least . energy is directed to the audience , but you do not see what is on the screen that you would be interested in seeing if you were still there . it is too depressing . i am not even sure if the title is about a girl or an imaginary boy . maybe it was a guy . who knows . it certainly is not like this movie can play out by itself . as far as i knew , there are no girls in the movies .|0
cowboys and indians is an excellent film . the writing , acting , directing could not have been better . there are so many scenes where the characters are trying to portray their characters that you can barely keep your eye on any of the characters in the movie . some of the scenes play out just fine . the plot is fairly interesting , but with a twist that makes it appear more like an ill - conceived comedy rather than anything good . i found the movie to be very unappealing at first , but when i started reading it i really started to dislike it .|0
"wow . just wow . never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad play . this movie is pretty much as awful as any of my movies can be . i was sitting at the computer when that character ' s face appeared on the screen . "" hey , why do you always look like you 've been running around with your clothes on ? i thought you were dead and could not see me anymore ? "" he asked while laughing . i had to laugh at him too because it seemed like he knew how to get his own jokes out of people ."|0
i really enjoyed this movie . i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it . the characters are fun to watch ; they make you want to laugh . even though i do n't need to watch every episode , i am happy that this film is one of my favorite movies about the first time i saw it in my life . if you like horror films , come to my house for an adventure ! if you did not , i would be happy to go to your house where you will find something quite nice to watch .|0
i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful , but damned if it did n ' t break new and improved hearts . the director seemed to know him well , and liked him very much , which is not a good thing in this case . i remember one time when i was young , my friend and his wife had just left their son and were coming to stay at a nearby house for christmas vacation . they could have made better money , you know , but they could n't afford to . there were too many other people who wanted out of this horrible place .|0
"This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is especially awful; it really appears that the editor (if there was one)literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. The opening has to be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know there are ""B"" films - but are there ""H"" films? If so, this one's an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan."|1
"with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made . huevos de oro seems to have been influenced by a lot of movies like this . there is no doubt the film i just watched last night was "" bad "" , but if you do n't know where that movie came from or what its purpose is then please leave me alone . thanks for seeing my film in its entirety . here is one of the few people who has actually read these movies before , so why are you staring at them as if they would be the most fascinating thing you ever saw ?"|0
A gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's holiday. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...Blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but to little avail. What should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard but that's it.|1
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well.|1
"The movie is nothing extraordinary. As a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...It's just another case of ""another teenage horror movie""-seen one and you've seen em all. First few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. The worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. Would have been better if it's written in Spanish."|1
Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting.

with its rerelease by adv films , i ' ve had a chance to watch ` ` the giant majin ' ' for about six hours . it doesn ' t look much like the big show they usually make when they ' re trying to beat up people . that ' s no easy task - you have to be very careful where you sit and try to move from place to place while watching this . it ' s amazing how you can watch everything on an episode without losing your mind . i found myself wishing there were some way i could watch one at least .|0
this is a very strange series with dean learner . i really did n ' t understand the guests . i knew it , but i didn ' t realize they were acting so weird . at the end of the movie , dean teacher comes into the room with a large box . he puts the box on the table next to us and turns off the tv . then he picks up one of the chairs and sits down in it . i had thought that was going to be an interesting movie to watch , but obviously it wasn ' t !|0
Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .Corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . Ed Nelson a very competent actor got started with Corman as well as many other favorites who show up in Superman and many of the westerns of the day . The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it .|1
i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered . it is very , very interesting to me that the first episode was actually filmed by one of the biggest and most famous writers in the world . i have never seen a show like this before which was a total surprise to me . this film is not quite what i wanted to see , but i guess it was better than watching my favorite movie ever . i do not know exactly what i expected to see , or why i was expecting anything different .|0
"Yahoo Serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. It is right up there with ""Lightning Jack"" and ""Les Patterson Saves the World"" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in Australia Yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy."|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until fairly recently deciding I should at least try to watch it and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part.|1
"would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word ` ` stupid ' ' ? "" she asked from her spot . i shrugged . i could n't remember the last time i felt like acting like an idiot . when i did it was always very short , and often ended up as an insult for the characters . this time was different . i made a funny face and thought it was funny , but after about twenty minutes of that , i began not to feel like a silly person at all ."|0
this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film . the story was n't very interesting at all , so there is no reason why i would want to share my opinion on the series . but it has an enjoyable ending and it does keep you laughing when you watch it . now i do enjoy hearing about movies as a hobby , but this is not going to be one for me . in the beginning , i had fun with this book , but after a while i gave up .|0
i have n ' t seen so many people packed outside a theater since star wars episode iii . both shows sold out in the last twenty - three years . they were just about to leave when one of their favorite directors and producers came down with a serious problem ( which he says is very serious ) . no one believes that there are any more actors left in the world , and even though the film was relatively cheap , they could have been bought out by an insurance company . there was only one good lead , and he died shortly after the film was fired .|0
i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera . i think it ' s a little bit influenced by the brazilian film as well , so i can ' t really enjoy it at this stage . not because i want to watch anything like this in real life , but because i am a little bored and want to see something that would make me feel better about how bad i ' m being forced to be a p * * n star . what could have possibly brought this on ? i do n't even know how i ' m supposed to judge this film if i don ' t watch it myself .|0
"ok , i ' ve now seen george zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense films recently as i worked my way back up through high school to take some pictures and have them made out . if i ' ve got any self - respecting indie author in the area , i ' m sure i can come up with someone who could put a smile on that face . "" don ' t get me wrong ; this film was good . it just doesn ' t really fit with the real world , which is why i chose it as an easy read for a first attempt ."|0
altioklar ' s populist approach manifests itself in all his titles , from the worst to the best . he does n't have an opinion that anyone likes ; he has a good eye for this sort of thing , and it 's very impressive . the main points are well - placed , but you get the gist of it by seeing what happens to people who play the same roles over and over again on television . there is no shortage of actors , actresses , actors , producers , etc . . they do not make much sense to me .|0
I watched this film not knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this.|1
art imitates life imitates art . atticus finch is reincarnated into the d . a . in this tragic and suspenseful gripping scene i can not take my eyes away from the one that seems to be so vividly real . it just goes to show how little you care about the characters in this tale . what is left of the plot should have been taken seriously , or at least slightly exaggerated as the story was edited out . the ending is somewhat disappointing , though i would not have thought such a short book would end up being so awful . there are some parts which actually make me laugh .|0
being a fan of Bela Lugosi,Boris Karloff,and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of Lugosi,Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad.|1
because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end . although there are some , but they do n't come in so well and most are just a bunch of crap , you can tell what is good and what is crappy . it was one of those late nights that made me look forward to the weekend . when i had my first date with an actress , it went pretty well . she told me all about the way she got up at six in the morning and drove over to our place to get dressed for the party .|0
this is a wonderful family sitcom . rowan atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms , the thin blue and red lines are extremely well rehearsed . i have never seen such a fine set up . there were so many comedies in my youth but i was only interested in some of them . if you do n't care that much about the film or any of the episodes , then just drop it out of your repertoire . what bothers me is that none of the scenes are exactly right . it 's difficult to be an actor who spends most of his time acting as a comedian .|0
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park. It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free.|1
This film is absolutely appalling and awful. It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art. The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this film.|1
the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i ' ve ever seen . aside from the movie that has made the book so funny , it really does not have a plot . there is always a plot , though , and sometimes you have to listen to the soundtrack and the dialogue for long periods of time until you finally realize how ridiculous they all are . when this movie first came out in 1979 , it seemed like everyone was having a wonderful time watching movies that did n't even make sense on any one of the major channels .|0
This movie really is that bad, and I'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through every title from Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form.|1
filmmaker bryan forbes , who once displayed a light , sardonic touch with beguiling material such as ` ` whistle down in the middle of the night ' . it was supposed to be his idea . so when he turned up on the morning edition of the times and said that he needed a break , i believed him . he had just left his wife , and she was still trying to work her way out of an awkward marriage with a child . for the first time since we came here , this guy seemed almost normal . he got himself a new job , a new name , and some nice clothes .|0
this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made - for - tv movie mysteries i ' ve ever watched . but it ' s been a bit of a long shot so far . what is the mystery ? why does everything have to end up in another movie ? if you really want to find out , do not hesitate to look around the screen and see the results of this movie , but if you are not looking for something interesting , do not bother . there is never a good start until you know what it looks like .|0
disclaimer : during my ventures into foreign cinema , i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies which are made in japan . i can not say that this series is any more realistic or engaging than the other books , but it has its moments . and what an opportunity this is . there are very few actors capable of making this type of film ; they are so poorly written they make no sense . i was particularly disappointed when i learned that you had to be an idiot to put out your own special effects . this movie is not for those with talent or knowledge of the film themselves .|0
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers.|1
I go this game and it is alright I guess. I just expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. Also the graphics aren't as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst out of the three.|1
the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito . the series ' star , meiko kaji , is a great cover shoot to be proud of . but i know for a fact that this movie is far more exciting than it will be in other parts of the planet . as a teenager i was a little afraid of these people because i had been taught that they were ruthless , heartless killers . when i first arrived in the united states , i got a lot of sympathy from the media for what they tried to do to me back in 1977 .|0
what ever happened to shows with united parental figures ? the parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the mother . i just do not know how a parent could get involved in such an evil thing , even if she is very young . so far i have seen it all and i have learned nothing about it . i found out when we got home that mom and dad were friends with the director of the show . at least he was n't the one who took off for the moon . then my first instinct was to go over there and talk to them .|0
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I hadn't. The movie wasn't scary.The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle. She continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother, and their blind daughter.|1
larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director , but he has made some great films . this one was the first film by the best of the year and i just want to thank everyone for their efforts . i know that we are all still in shock from our initial visit here , but thanks to my mother who is helping us move into this house she managed to make some new furniture and put together some nice things so we can have some space . it 's amazing what happens in these moments .|0
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can't. oh yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now, the shark in this movie is a really fake looking CGI shark.|1
if you listen to ween ( the pod , god / satan ) , then you know what ' s going on with them . they are just a bunch of spoiled little kids who do n't care about any of us or their family . and there was another one in the same boat as me . he has an abusive relationship that goes back for a bit and turns into something terrible . his father died last year and now he has to live with his uncle and cousin . his mother does not approve of his decision to go to hollywood .|0
There are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. It is the prime example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could get released.Our killers name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?)|1
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film. After years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. The kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.Interestingly, it turns out that Mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college.|1
This is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had I known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. When finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime.|1
i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays . it is not good to be bored when someone has so much potential but there are plenty of ways to make fun of him . what i really want to know is why he would choose to stay in a theatre like this . how did he get into the theater ? well , i will just admit to being amazed at all the performances he had performed and some of them were awful . that is if you can believe everything you read about in the times .|0
having just seen walt disney ' s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube , i thought it was ridiculous to watch this dvd . i could not fathom why anyone would watch that movie . no wonder they were afraid of ghosts . but there were other people in it too , so that must mean they were trying to make their movies funny or a joke at all . i had never watched any films like this before . most of the films were boring , except for the ones about the witch hunter and how he is trapped by her powers .|0
' blade ' would be an extremely above - average comic - book , vampire - hunter action / horror if it were n ' t for two minor flaws . the first flaw is that it is too hard to write . when someone tells you they want to write a good book and you want to keep watching it , you expect to be disappointed with the whole thing . it was a very well - done one . i think i have seen some books in the future where people did not see what was left of the original crime scene .|0
"I probably have to blame myselfbut I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title ""Black Dragons"" and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one."|1
james stewart plays johnny mason , lawyer . carole lombard is jane mason , wife . lucile watson the mother - in - law is a very attractive woman with short , sandy blonde hair and blue eyes . they both like to get together sometimes , but there is no reason why they need to be together as a couple . we do n't watch the movie because it just keeps going round and round in my mind . i 'm not saying that she is hot ; it 's just that she can be one of the most beautiful females in the world .|0
oldboy is set in korea & starts as a drunken dae - su oh ( min - sik choi ) is bailed out of the country by his own parents who keep him in an isolated prison . it seems to be getting more and more boring as the summer goes along . you may want to watch this one . there are plenty of things written about the film , but they never seem to come alive for me . well , maybe it will if i 'm paying attention , because this film has got some real drama . the main thing that happens is that the actors end up staying together .|0
ed wood rides again . the fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope . it 's hard to believe a bunch of people who do what they think is right when everyone else is in a panic about the safety of their children . there is nothing more scary than watching three kids ' parents run around shooting arrows at each other . you really want to see something scary about this movie but i am not ready yet for that . so i have had to wait for the last hour to get up to watch this film .|0
i was n ' t sure where this was headed until the ending . when it turned out that this was all a big waste of gas , i went over and asked her if she wanted to go back and watch another one of my scary horror movies with me . for some reason the idea of being scared of watching an awful movie scares the hell out of me . i had to fight back tears and tell myself to get through the movie . after a while though i could not take it anymore . i had to leave the movie room .|0
The greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director.|1
This movie is bad. I saw the rated and the unrated versions. They are terrible!! Now, I know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. It's not funny! Not funny at all!! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie let me down. At least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. And is it me, because Mundae is not a great looking woman.|1
"""Love Life"" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene."|1
"Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor actors. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The ""Arab terrorists"" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the ""Arab terrorist""...DAMN!There is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like).The movie is divided into two parts."|1
Not really worth a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there... Bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. At firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... However all this changes... and you still won't care.|1
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you.|1
"LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean ""Tom Cruise"". Maverick means ""non-conformist"". ), is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport, Florida."|1
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's Seattle Film Fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of Gershwin, Cole Porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards.|1
no spoiler needed to steer you clear of this . . . well , bizarre film . canada becomes part of the usa . i like that movie ( yes , i 'm saying it as a matter of fact ! ) . actually , my wife loves it ; and she loved it in the same way . but she never really did get the hang of it , or even try to use it to make me believe that the plot was all lies . this movie was just an elaborate attempt to confuse me into thinking that they were making a mistake .|0
"a lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul . some , a handful . it is also very hard to distinguish the "" actor "" with an actor , because there are too many parts that do n't make sense . if you want to watch this film , go to the internet cafe where they sell out their screenplay and buy your own new version . you 'll be shocked how often movies are made in order to get a decent script . i was looking forward to watching this film but i did not care about the plot at all ."|0
do n ' t get me wrong this was fun to watch . it has some nice animation with exception of an action film which makes no sense , the plot is too stupid , and the dialogue does not match any movie i have ever heard of before . if you were watching this movie , you would see a woman being interviewed by the police for prostitution . what she wants to do is hire the real killers . she goes off to kill her husband so he can pay his debts . when he dies , she takes his body back to her mansion in the hills .|0
During filming, was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon? It was like she was reading from an autocue. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. I read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface.|1
"I thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of ""national security."" The show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. After a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and I started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead."|1
Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.|1
"cheezy ? yep . poorly filmed ? you betcha . zero budget ? they proudly claim it on their posters , not to mention the awards and awards of film . a few times i was told that this film would be made in about two hours ' time by a man who called himself "" my friend "" but did not really believe it . his face was red and he seemed to make it through each audition like he owned the world . i tried to get into his head to try and figure out why he was acting so badly or why he has such a bad acting career ."|0
I have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. It is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. I totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. I think it is a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I have shown it to simply loves it. It is too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success.|1
"I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she ""finds herself""."|1
i watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations , having just graduated college and moved on to a different type of movie than i enjoyed . after the third or fourth show , i found myself trying to learn more about the film . i even asked my parents to take me on an early christmas cruise to see it because i liked them . but they would n't go . i mean , how could they let their daughter spend christmas morning with someone like that ? what kind of parent lets their child spend christmas night in his girlfriend 's home ?|0
"while it ' s not ` ` perfect ' ' , it ' s close . love barbara stanwyck , sz sakall , sidney jones , john smith and the rest of my class . if you enjoy this story , take a moment to comment about what i ' m telling you . i want to thank everyone for their support as they came to know me . now let us get off the bus ; there is still much to do . we "" d been on the bus for another ten minutes when the music stopped and people started to file out of the bus ."|0
i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager . i grew up with the sesame street family who were my parents ' children . it is like they all knew each other in some way but could not say what it was . i am still trying to figure it out as to why i wanted to be a lawyer at first . anyway , one day during a business trip to california , there was a large explosion in the lobby that threw the building off of its balance and caused a huge chunk of plaster and concrete to cave in on top of the lobby .|0
Low budget mystery. A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan(Chick Chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. The woman in a hurry, Mary(June Clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the real thing. This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape.|1
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things."|1
"Okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but I actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. At the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). This baby falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category to me, and for that alone I would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day."|1
"I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic."|1
it may be hard to explain how , but this film is a masterpiece . perhaps , because i never saw the movie when i watched it before , i will have to let you see one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen and think that they are just a bunch of random stuff . there is something in this movie that has changed my mind . as long as you are here with me , what is wrong with that movie ? i did not know anything about this movie , and i did not ask for this job .|0
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I popped this sucker in. It was worse than I had expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. There was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. Now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were?|1
i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20 - year - old intern from my office ( ok - it was the quiet ones , not the angry ones ) . they went to get the popcorn because the kid had so little food on his tray that he just forgot to get something to eat when he started eating . i watched the movie again after watching the other dvd and it was the funniest thing about it . i really wanted to be able to make popcorn for real ! one of the funniest things about this movie is that it was all over the internet .|0
"I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBALL player coming to the end of their time in Major League sports must face. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.Overall, it is a good movie to watch on Cable TV or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the ""Dog Day's"" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away."|1
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina.This film came out when the Original Star Wars proved there was a market for Science Fiction. This in turn lead to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.)|1
mean spirited , and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children ' s tale not only lacks the charm of the novel ( which i could n't resist ) , but lacks in the overall believability of the book . it just does n't fit any of the characters at all . there are many other things going on with this series , like a few great comedies that have been re - released over the years , but they never really make up for what has passed . each one is an exception to the rule and a good way to end a film .|0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier.|1
what an utter disappointment . forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead . what on earth are we doing in a movie ? it 's too bad i had n't thought this through more . the show was really nothing more than a comedy . although there was a plot line for the title , i would never have been able to figure out where it ended . it was a terrible idea . the first thing you can do when you make your films is pick them apart and find out what they were made for . every movie starts off well .|0
I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like I did).|1
"this was a great movie , i would compare it to the movie the game . you get to the scene where the guy who runs around like a zombie is killed , and he falls down the stairs , and all the zombies start coming out of his head at once , so we just watch . "" "" i really liked this movie ! "" alex said . "" the characters were extremely funny . do you remember how many people were murdered for their acting skills ? if you have any ideas about doing something like that , they should come with us . """|0
this fantasy was utter garbage . i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti - government movies , but this one is completely different . i could n't help thinking that he might be able to do a good job if he tried real hard . in the end , it got to the point where i could n't even get him to say anything useful . he just kept talking about how great his idea was . it would sound silly to anyone else except me , but i am a big fan of science fiction and science fiction films as well .|0
do not see ` ` mr . magoo . ' ' it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . ' well , at least this movie got better than the others . but i could n't tell you what it was like . they did great , but it just seems to have gone off the deep end . i know this because i saw it with my own eyes when i was a kid and i looked through the camera as though it was being shot from a very high - intensity camera . unfortunately for me , it worked . i really loved the way it ran .|0
First of all, I personally adore Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in Russia when I was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. Then I heard nothing about Mr Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it is certainly not a good coming back! Why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul?|1
low budget , but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story . this movie is good : there is something of a comic quality to it , even if it does look like a bit more fun than it is . ( especially when you watch that movie . ) i mean , these two characters are obviously going to turn out okay . for instance , the guy from the other night looks just like a character from frankenstein ' s monster , except his face looks less like frankenstein ' s monster and more like frankenstein ' s monster .|0
I'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I could've done without the female nudity but I'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!)|1
The core issues at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film). End of Days, unfortunately, is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon. Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.|1
"Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely under-used and has SO much more to offer besides ""Agent Mulder"" (although I'm a huge fan of that series too), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows love never dies... it's with you forever."|1
piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . i thought you were an expert on this movie ! it 's been so many weeks that i have lost count . there are more than two dozen episodes of the film with such a big screen that you can practically see through it . just what is going on in the movies ? my parents would love to know that they are allowed to watch these films . i am sure that they want to get to know the character and how he lives , or rather how he feels .|0
Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast, great lead performance. Worth watching.Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright.The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.|1
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame. George was great in that character - very expressive.Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part. She gave a great performance. She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS.|1
this is a poor , poor movie . full of cliches , unrealistic moments : punching the air in celebration of a winning game , acting like there was nothing wrong with it - but it 's not . it is so stupid . we all see the bad movies and then we watch them . you just watch the bad movies . i have never seen much of the good ones . i have watched enough for one lifetime , but the bad ones are almost too many . they are so ridiculous that i do n't know what to make of them .|0
i liked this movie , not because tom selleck was in it , but because it was a good story . it did have a lot of sequences and characters that were interesting to watch . the main difference between cinematography like this book and film like this is that they do not get all of the things that are on the outside . this movie does not have one of the most interesting situations that i have ever been involved with in my entire life . first , i had to know if there was a reason why the director decided to shoot a movie that would be better than any other comedy in the theater .|0
An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him.|1
I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before.|1
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.|1
I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper, and Phoebe try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with Piper.|1
First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent!|1
"when the circus comes to town and places the lion ' s cage directly over bugs bunny ' s home , bugs bunny will put his tail on the door and watch a cartoon . you know , it ' s not that exciting , but i suppose one has to take what "" they "" say at face value , right ? ! this show is so much better than any i have seen . everyone is funny and entertaining ( although i can understand that some people might look down their noses at me for being such a putz ) ."|0
i first saw this movie in the theater . i was 10 . i just watched it a second time when i got into a car accident to go to school and find out what happened . it was really sad . there are all kinds of terrible jokes - you ca n't even make them up , they are so bad . then there are some funny movies that do n't matter at all , and those are the best ones . i did not actually read any of them because i was a very good actor . i still remember how excited my mom looked when i picked up the magazine with the picture on it .|0
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight. I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman. Wishful thinking, I know. Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.|1
This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. Yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm making out, but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.|1
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it and I've always had a soft spot for her.Basically, the owner of a book store, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it.|1
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, I must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact.|1
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on Quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such faint praise from me.|1
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order.|1
i tried watching this movie , but i did n ' t make it past the first 15 minutes . it ' s a bit like watching a horror movie instead of watching a movie about life in general . they don ' t give you any special insights on how these things are made . i couldn ' t stand watching this movie ! the plot was not very great . i ' m not one of those people who enjoy seeing bad movies . what really bothers me most is the way the credits have to change .|0
the back of the dvd for this movie raves , ` ` chey is the quentin tarantino of christian films . it 's a very nice movie and they did really well ' . i feel like i need to get something off my chest . first of all there was no way in the world i could ever have imagined being a movie director or being an agent when i graduated high school . secondly , not even a single title would have made sense from a sci - fi movie , especially one based on these awful people . then there is the fact that i have yet to find out who hired the actors .|0
This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue.|1
"This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The script was awful. What was even worse were the camera shots and sound. Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had ""recreated"" the top of the building."|1
"most awful casting i ' ve ever seen . clark kent as a crack head , a very feminine looking woman with long dark - red hair who has no breasts and is the only female actor on this film . "" "" you ' ll love this movie , "" julie told her .

"" "" what 's wrong with them anyway ? """|0
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. I actually ran across this movie by accident. I was taping another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates...who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values (religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family.|1
Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. I can't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here folks. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous.|1
a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating , the pace in the movie was so high . then after it started i just kept thinking , if i can just watch that movie without making a scene ( which i did ) i think i will feel better . i am not a huge fan of bad movies . it was really lame but i still thought they could improve . there are no good movies where you get the feeling that there has been a horrible film . i have seen some bad movies but i never saw this one .|0
a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies , the comebacks tells the story of an out - of - luck coach , lambeau , who lost his head . it seems to me that this movie is no better than that in which he lost his life . i can think of only three more reasons why someone could have stayed on the team from the start . the fact that they never made it to the top of their class makes my heart skip a beat . i just ca n't understand why people would stay so close to him . there must be some special reason behind it .|0
the worst sequel I've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny.|1
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. This film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way.|1
"just when i thought nothing could be as offensive and / or irritating as a billy mays infomercial , i had the misfortune of getting in to watch a show that did n't even remotely relate to tv shows . this was one of those episodes where people were trying to have some semblance of normality and the show would never end . i mean really , there was only one bad thing about this show , and i am not particularly impressed by the way it went along . for example , the first time i saw this show , my first thought was "" what the hell did they make this show out of ?

Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time.|1
Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it.|1
. . . what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad part . but i want to make this movie interesting so that i can watch it with you on film , which is quite an effort for me . please do n't be embarrassed by my performance . i was not very good with horror movies . however , when i started reading about this film , it was very much like one of those horror films where the guy turns into a zombie and takes his friend and tries to kill them .|0
"This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realise it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK), but this was awful. The family were so cheesy, ""Love you mum"" ""Love you even more honey"" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, ""Love you mum"" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home."|1
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the Jon Hall, Maria Montez films which have long since become camp. This one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. It's a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity.|1
i did have a good time the first 45 min . or so , but then suddenly it was all over . there is a huge gap in the last 20 min of the dvd , and if that were to be true we would never find out what happened to it . i ' d had plenty of time to look through it , and just could not believe my ears . how could you do something like this without thinking about your own safety ? i don ' t know how i survived it . no one can compare to me at the best of times .|0
* minor spoilers * i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films , this is one . this movie has an excellent rating rate of 3 minutes per second but not as well as the actual scores . i thought it was a great movie and hoped that someone will tell me where they have been in it . there is a lot more interesting stuff than this at home . on the surface , this movie is pretty crappy . the characters are poor and the plot is completely lame . the acting is awful . the music is lousy .|0
when i bought 4 dvds for £5 . oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was bad , not making it amusing . by the way , i had to pay 10 dollars an hour and i could see that it would be hard on the customers . also , i did n't ask what they thought were so bad about me buying these movies or even the title of the film . if you think there is nothing wrong with this movie , you better look at the other shows . i do n't know much about the actors but they seem to be okay .|0
Peter Strauss, by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films, often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, having channel-hopped into it half-way through. Well, I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film! !Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much....|1
not all movies are oscar worthy but let ' s face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun . if you go through a movie like this one , i am just about the only person on this planet that is going to be watching it . in my book , the bad guy wins out . well , it seemed to me that maybe he did win out at the end . after all , i told myself that there had to be a good reason why people watched them . yeah , right ! what a load of crap !|0
"I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this...ever! My favorite part is when Grace(Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, ""WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?"" I do believe everyone(No matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile."|1
dude . . . i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci - fi freak . . . but this is too much to think about at such a late age . let 's all just be grateful there was no one to see or listen to us when we first got into the movie . in fact , it might have gone better if it was just for an hour or two . instead , it just ended like this . i never saw this film , but i am really glad because i always knew that this was wrong . it was so stupid and dumb !|0
This was it! i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff.The one thing that i hated was that why was Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore!|1
Ostensibly, Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. And despite the complex portrayal--Hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims--the above must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking as well (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may look no further than Hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion.|1
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I watched the manga review in a magazine, I thought it was maybe interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity.OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series have an standard. But as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical based upon the Christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. It features some demons and stigmata scenes... Totally nonsense.|1

Like some other people wrote, I'm a die-hard mario fan, and I loved this game. This game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it!Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's that good!)|1
"Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of ""personal immediacy"" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie."|1
it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he gets the job done . we all laugh but as far as i am aware the movie has been remade in this very house three times . what do you know , the story is a complete waste of your time and my money . if it is anything like the great horror movie from the 1950 's then it will probably be the worst sequel to the last one ever made . ok , so it is not actually bad for the first six months after the movie was made , just a slow - moving process .|0
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself.|1
i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film ? ? its not because of money spent on the movie . it is because i enjoyed it as much as i enjoy being with my friends and family . when i was watching the film for the first time , i wanted to skip through it a little and see what made it happen . but no , i did not watch it at all . instead , i sat in silence and watched the only person that i love most in the world spend their time watching a movie that should have cost millions .|0
jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion . the story has some good parts and it is very well written . what we are looking for here is to find that there was a battle between the japanese and china during which they actually won . this time however , the battles went on for more than an hour . all i can say for certain is that this movie is not quite as good as it was . if you do not want to watch any of these films , you should keep your nose out of it .|0
Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who set up the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him.|1
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing ( especially when they were talking about me as a boy ) . i was trying to be a good little girl while watching this film , and it really did not make much sense whatsoever . how can a person become such a monster when he is that horrible ? it has been over a year since the last time i saw this film and there are still no similarities . the scenes are awful but they just look bad enough . the plot looks like it has never been made in its life or even seen one from this angle before .|0
"The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the life long friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the Stooges multi decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays ""Curly"" Howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved Stooge."|1
* * * * * * spoilers within * * * * * * * what a dull , predictable and unentertaining narrative it is . to this day i am reluctant to watch this show because of its mediocre quality . not that it should make sense to me . but i do love those stories . in fact i was rather interested in watching them myself . so , after a couple of years i stopped watching the show . there were some times when i did n't want to watch it as much as i wanted to be in the cinema - that 's why i let this show go on for quite a while .|0
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette.|1
"I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's ""contestants"" are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune.For anyone to appear on National TV and blubber, sniffle, and whine about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, aren't our responsibility?"|1
the film tells you to be aware and conscientious . it also destroys any and all things , the bible , music , books , and movies . that movie takes its toll on your character . if you believe in such a stupid movie you 'll probably like this one because i have been watching it since i was about 15 and thought it would be fun . this film is very bad . there is no way i could find out what is happening in this film when i had the time and money to buy it . the only way to make this movie real is to see it with me .|0
This was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. Character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script? ), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?|1
I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard they are coming soon.) Commander's Log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. It's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the put-down... I just wish I could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers!|1
i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye - rolling lines , but there was a flaw and it got lost in the credits . this movie had been made on youtube , and it was based on an original version of the book . i could n't find any errors in it at all . no flaws at all , and i do not think i ever will ! this was the best damn movie ever . the script was very different from the movies i watched with my parents , but the plot was completely different .|0
As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars.|1
this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . generic and boring , there is nothing funny about them . if you do have to laugh at something horrible , take a picture for your book . i can imagine that some people would like to watch these film clips in the movies but i doubt they ever had any interest in such things . after the movie ends , we begin to watch some of the other movies . it will be a good time to get into some interesting stuff , even if it does not seem fun .|0
police squad ! ( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon . but i guess it had to end when they were all gone , and so i have a hard time looking at anything more amusing than this film . i would give my left nut for a big red box with gold writing on it instead of yellow and blue characters . why the heck did n't people buy a tape ? or a real paper ? or maybe i am just imagining things , but it looked like something made out of cardboard from one of the most ridiculous movies ever made .|0
"existenz was a good film , at the first i was wondering what is going on , organic ` ` pods "" that have seen this many times before . now it 's getting boring , but then i started to realize how ridiculous it was to be making all of this up ! there really are not enough movies about aliens and other alien species for me to even bother watching any . so i decided to just watch some comedy and see what happens . when i got in the movie i went into the theatre and asked the woman behind the desk if there were any better movies that she would recommend ."|0
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn't have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal.|1
a good story about rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would like to live and work in the world , with a few friends who are as talented as she is , but can also be very bad . if anyone can turn it into a decent story it will be them . at least i think so . all of the kids have one thing in common : they want their mom to live and work in a high - class hotel that costs $ 2 , 256 dollars . i just do n't see what this big deal has to do with money .|0
"Jerk hazer Mike(David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam(Caleb Roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. They get PO'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty(Kristina Sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."|1
"OK,I've seen over 100 Troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" was horrible, and ""I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist"" was unwatchable, but this is THE WORST FILM IN THE TROMA LIBRARY!A bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.This is really terrible. Even as exploitation films go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs."|1
"i watched love life on holiday , when it was filmed at a film festival in florida . it was good , and very romantic , but i felt so bad about what i did to it . "" "" no one can help you now . it is hard for all of us to make an effort to make this movie any better . we would probably end up making the whole movie look like some kind of horror movie . "" "" how do you get to be a director if you ca n't make films ? "" "" by working . "" "" i never saw that movie . """|0
It's not fair. I was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, After seeing Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes.|1
the untold origin of the lone ranger . it shows who he was and how and why he became the protagonist in the first place . i am a bit envious of ' the lone ranger ' , after all this time i can tell you that the legend of the lone ranger is based on fact rather than story . there are only two people who would have had something like this done , my wife and i were both married and we lived in our own houses - even though her husband died before she was able to settle down .|0
thank god for this movie . it ' s a document of talent that , three decades later , seems even worse than it ' s already been . in the last week , i have come to realize that i was just being a good actor . if you were a man with a job like this , you didn ' t spend very much time in the theatre . i ' ve known actors who spent their entire careers in theatres or theatres . most of those movies were so badly made that it is not surprising that they got hit by a big car .|0
Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isn't too much to complain about.|1
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. I suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can I say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (Omega Code, Left Behind).|1
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the French ruling Spain. The movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So, the movie gets confusing then. The movie begins when Ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judiasm by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put to the Question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison.|1
Right... so you have a dam, tons of water (that seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens to be right underneath the dams path of destruction. Throw in a profiteering glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting. All in all, when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view... I would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay-per-view film. If you want a laugh... then you really need to watch this film.|1
I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well... not so bad. Genre: scifi...good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was looking forward to have a relaxing Sunday evening watching it. But but...NO.As in summary, this isn't a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. Movie starts with a epic abduction story: Driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... Well, actually that was the film.|1
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness. not only was the name a complete misnomer--since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas--but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately i waited until the end in my case. that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim.|1
"This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of ""Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" and am now watching ""Enterprise"".I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It is more like an attempt at slapstick.It does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. It does little to build the series.Why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. Was it the writing? Was it the directing?"|1
bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center , an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit cards for a small fortune . now he does n't have any time left to buy another tv show . i guess you can see what we 're talking about - this movie was not his favorite . in fact , i do n't believe it was his only favorite . on the one hand , it was fairly entertaining , and at the end of the film he had been able to justify himself by showing off some of his ' talent ' to the audience .|0
"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from ""evidence"" to ""violence,"" I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money."|1
i think this is one of the best tamil movies i ' ve seen in a while . i love the way he tells stories and makes it all seem so boring . at least then i would have had something to believe in . but no , i watched this stupid movie because there were too many scary people around to believe in anything worth listening to . i found out that james roy was a friend of the guy whose wife died . that is another story . i never liked james roy , but he tried to help me . i did not like him when i saw him again .|0
when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january ( 2005 ) i did n ' t like it . i got mad and wanted to shoot it again , even though it made my stomach cramp . it was a good movie , although i ca nt say that i really understood why anyone would want to be an actor . there is no such thing as what you are hoping to achieve . it just isn ' t worth it . the people who make it look great do not understand what you have done . all they care about is the movie and the person who has said something wrong .|0
this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen . on a par with blair witch - doctor , it was awful . the lines are atrocious ; i just wanted to watch a movie with someone like blair witch doctor instead . even though i liked blair witch - doctor ' s films , the title sucks ! there is no telling what i might have written in the first hour . the only thing that keeps me from doing it is thinking about how stupid i look . why did i write this film ?|0
i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river , near shasta when this movie was being filmed and it got a bit out of hand . as you probably realize , we do n't have all that many cameras at our disposal , but this is one of those rare occasions when the quality of these pictures is just a tad too poor to be seen on tv . this film is based on the first two episodes they put together and i know from history that none of us has ever watched one of these shows , but there you have it .|0
"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) portrayal of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been ""created"" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself."|1
when the movie first started i thought cheesy . the first ten minutes were really boring . after the slow movie i was surprised to see more action in there . it was so much worse than the movie back at school . every one of the audience had their own line , they just did not understand how a comedy would actually get a good plot or what we should expect to happen . and even if we did have a chance of having a good plot , i do not think we could make it through the film without being completely out of touch with reality itself .|0
"oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry ""D"" student able to outsmart only stupid people."|1
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. It was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp.|1
This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies.|1
has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet ? i can see that a lot of people do , since the first two were very old - school and almost uninteresting . so much so that it does not even occur to one of us that an author might actually write these books . if you have seen them , please find out what else is up . but no matter what , this will be the most boring book of its kind on dvd . it is really just a bunch of silly films . i would n't worry about such nonsense .|0
i watched this movie recently mainly because i am a huge fan of jodie foster ' s . i saw this movie after the second half and wanted to go to the cinema and see it with my own eyes . i can still remember how wonderful it was . you can see that the only one who was not disappointed was the lead in the series . there was a very nice plot but it was mostly bad , so they had to try something better than that . unfortunately , the premise was somewhat unoriginal . i do n't know what i thought about this movie except that it was a great idea .|0
"*some possible spoilers*Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the ""harmless"", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay."|1
I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! He gave us the awesome (at it's time)Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to super stardom. Then followed that up with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and Thrills.|1
william petersen ( that c . s . i guy ) has a small uncredited role but it ' s the best part of the show . the movie is like a tv documentary , and they can make all kinds of funny things happen to you . this is one of the funniest films i ' ll ever see . there is nothing remotely funny about what happens here . every actor knows he ' s not supposed to act like this , but they are so used to acting out of character that they don ' t give a crap what they do .|0
I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.What I AM bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL of the episodes were staged. Hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.The premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer.|1
eaten alive follows a young woman ( janet agren ) who searches for her lost sister . turns out her daughter is in hiding , and after some research she discovers the whereabouts of the missing girl . with the help of professor antwhistle it turns out they both survived the crash . but that is really all i know about it . there are no other clues on the case and i am afraid i just ca n't do it . i could write something like this as a joke and everyone would laugh , but i want to see what happened to janet .|0
I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The dialog is cheesy. Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he's supposed to be from.|1
"This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to ""escape"" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute."|1
perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen ' s works has been portrayed . perhaps , as i read this , the writer may be willing to forgive a misjudgement that he ' s not aware of . perhaps it is just a case of making up for his own mistakes in the present tense . i would like to quote an old film from the late 1990s when there ' s a group of kids going out and around on a date and having a good time . they are so stupid and unimaginative , that i find myself thinking that someone should tell them what they think is true .|0
i seriously dont know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released . sure , some of the characters were friendly and fun to watch but none of them had an ulterior motive . there are plenty of people who would be thrilled to watch this movie . the plot is pretty crappy and the film is full of bad comedy . you have to wonder what it would be like if the actors could have been more like each other . i guess we should take this moment and let us say thank you to those who made it through all these horrible times in their life .|0
"Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film? From the opening line ""I'm getting too old for this"" through the ""antics"" of the firemen, to the ""worrisome wife"" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at Disney (""Our studies show that audiences really like it when..."" and then they stuck it in).There is nothing original here."|1
I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series.|1
` ` the next karate kid ' ' is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises . it has a lot of intrigue , lots of suspense , but i always find some interesting things that do n't sound like they will ever go away . the plot is good , the characters are pretty good , and the story is great . if i was not in the mood for comedy , i would probably agree with the movies . the whole idea is to have two kids who are only about ten years old at the time , as soon as their parents come to take them to school to meet their father .|0

story of an ex - navy seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art russian air force . i met him a couple of times but it was never the same man . we were so much alike in age , but at the same time seemed as if he was trying to tell me something i do n't even want to know . i have seen one of his films but this is the first time ever that i have seen my own film . i am surprised you did not see this one because it was one of the worst movies i can ever remember seeing .|0
' the dresser ' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to love . it has a funny quality , even though it 's just an old sci - fi movie , at least it has some serious character and emotion . no matter what it does its characters are all good , right ? i liked the original film and was looking for something more entertaining . unfortunately , when i saw the sequel to the same movie i realized that it did not seem like it could ever get good enough .|0
this made for tv film is about every cliche you can come up with for a disaster movie . the only thing that was good about it , was that it had to be something good . as a matter of fact , the best thing i ever saw on one of those cable tv shows when i was in college was my sister - in - law coming to visit me at home one saturday afternoon . she 's pretty cool and i 'm lucky if i got to spend any time with her after that . even more lucky is that she just moved away from her family near new jersey .|0
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel books. Counting this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i preferred greatly to this. It goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. I don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script.|1
as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks had suffered . it seemed that even one of these two boys should be put down for a crime , but then again maybe he was just having fun watching them kill each other . i did n't have time to look at the movie , so i spent the next five minutes watching it with my eyes closed . there was no way i wanted to watch this movie . it was just plain awful and made me wish that i had never seen it .|0
"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it."|1
creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle . in all my life as a child i have never seen anything like this . no one has shown me this movie , nor heard about it or even seen the movie on tv . i do n't care for the plot , it is just boring . i really am not going to spend the rest of my life watching the movie . after seeing so many episodes of zombie movies , i was beginning to start to want to watch it myself .|0
well folks , this is another stereotypic portrayla of gay life however , the additional downside includes poor acting , which is quite bad for your career , because you just missed the film . i have to say , it is a great movie , but the actors are horrible . in fact , the cast and crew were so lousy that if i played one of the actors with them i might not even be aware of his name . how could any man possibly think he would get away with this ? who was the actor by the end ? did he really have an actress in there ?|0
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way.|1
"While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. A few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: ""I ate a rabbit."" ""I TOLD you she was possessed!"" ""Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?! ""There are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.The story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the Priest)."|1
"Dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X.When it appears that a straight laced Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character.Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls? ""Naturally, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore so as to ruin him politically."|1
"It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "" Bigger and better "" but I'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - Rumours . But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004 Channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston . Yes that Christopher Eccleston an actor I've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true ."|1
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many but I'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say I like 'em, especially Guts of a Beauty (aka Entrails of a Beautiful Woman). Watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and I was surprised how well it actually went over.Entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of Asia (specifically Japan in this case).|1
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious ""star"" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity."|1
shame shame shame on ua / dw for what you do ! i was appalled . do not take kids to see the bad movies - they are a waste of space . the only way to learn from those films is to study them , get their opinions and find out if they 're really good or bad . if you think there are no problems with the movie , then you can stop reading books because this book is so lame . if you think it is lame , go ahead . however , at first i did n't know that there were issues with the movie .|0
"this is an alright show to watch , its not the best nor the worst . i ' ve watched it before but i never really liked it and i have seen a lot of bad shit over the years , that is to say the same thing happens here . "" "" yeah , it was good enough for me , i had no interest in being an actor and only enjoyed watching it . i had just decided to write a comedy on the internet , when i was taken by a strange man who wanted to teach me how to surf ."|0
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan. I figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15 minute mark , I was begiing the others to let me rip the DVD out and fling it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore it had to get better.They were wrong! This movie was lacking everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it.|1
this movie had an excellent premise , and could have been a fascinating look at racism , attitudes to women in general . the only real problem i saw in the film was the quality with which it was filmed . even though the film has a lot of plot elements and is not much different than what we are used to watching in television movies , it can also be scary . there is no need to change the story to that . as far as i am concerned , the best thing you can do is just shut up for a minute and watch .|0
cool flick . enjoyable to watch . hope to see more from fred carpenter soon . i really like the movies . i would love to see them again in the coming weeks , but at the moment they are so much of a jumble . there is something about the action that just does n't feel right . it feels like it is not worth watching . we get to sit through a movie and have no clue how to enjoy it . this movie is such a stupid cliché . why do they need to make this crap up ? what 's the point of having a plot if the plot is so awful ?|0
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this film. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. Maybe this movie isn't Academy Award material, but it sure is feel good material.|1
"Though I have watched Salò, I do not know if excrement tastes tart. If it does, this ""film"" is accurately titled. So much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense I would. Detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure."|1
"This rendition of ""Noah's Ark"" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. However, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in ""how not to make a movie""Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:""Ok, boys, let's saddle up."" ""It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night."""|1
"I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of ""five stars!"" on that Attack of the Show show. Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie."|1
"I can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can't imagine anything better.First, there's the music -- take ""Johanna"" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition."|1
` ` the dresser ' ' is perhaps the most refined of backstage films . the film is brimming with wit and humor , but it takes too much effort and concentration . all the great actors have their moments when they feel the need to sing , dance , or play a role that does not deserve their talents . this particular version is one of those times - an old movie from long ago where there was only one major problem . first of all i am not trying to tell you what happened . i am trying to let you be aware of why this film is so important .|0
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited, roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it is Disney, you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer.|1
I could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. The plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. Respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances.|1
chris penn is hilarious as the all - time stoner brother of jeff spicoli . this movie is great because it was an amazing film and it did not seem at all scary , so you should be glad you were chosen to watch it . anyway , i just loved this book and wanted to have a good time but there was a slight bit of irony in the whole thing . this was a total disaster . what a terrible movie . oh well , i can still make it interesting . no one paid much attention to me at that point because i could not focus .|0
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto, Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie.|1
Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this.|1
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.We saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive.|1
the director of this movie is a famous french tv presenter , patrick sebastien . he likes music and humor and has been known throughout the industry as one of the most popular in hollywood . it is his story that seems so out of character on the surface ; you can not even begin to guess what kind of trouble he got into when he first came to la . i have seen an awful lot of crappy shows like this one . i wish i could say it was worth seeing , but they never really make me any money at all .|0
i give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic . also it is directed by legendary people . this movie has been known to be very entertaining , but the characters are so bad . the plot is not that good ( just terrible ) . in fact , it looks more like something you would watch from one of those old sitcom comedies than anything that could happen in real life . i hate the idea that some sort of evil creature can come out of nowhere and start creating havoc everywhere . it is too awful for anyone to see .|0
this movie has to be the worst film i have seen . there is a reason it was made to go out of its way to become the most popular movie ever , but in some instances it just makes no sense whatsoever . at the very top of the list is the main protagonist . i have read many books and i loved the characters , but nothing compares to this movie . this movie has an overall quality that i had never seen before . one thing i can say is that i am looking forward to seeing the movie again .|0
there must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie . in fact , if it makes you feel any better , i was the only one to get this information . what i know is that when the camera came on , they discovered a man sitting at the back with two women , one of them wearing a suit , and a man wearing a dress . both were looking up at the ceiling , while the other one was acting like a moron . apparently , he did not pay attention to his surroundings because he just stayed quiet for about thirty seconds .|0
ho hum . just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and such . that is why you must find out about his life as a journalist . he is not what he appears to be - i do n't know much about the actual man , except that it sounds pretty boring . no one wants to tell him any more than they do about the movie , so for lack of anything better to say , let 's just go along with the theme . first of all , this movie is too lame to waste time on .|0
As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic I am, I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday, I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.The movie is truly more character/story driven than action.|1
i saw this film in the movie theater . i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course , you can never see all the famous characters that were involved in this movie as they go out on dates and buy gifts for their families . i got it from one of those tv sitcoms . not very original or interesting , but it 's better than what most people will think of when viewing a movie . let me tell you about some of the great comedies that have taken place in this area over the years .|0
seriously ! you ' ve just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it . it ' s such a disaster , i ' m surprised there ' s not some other way to get around it . the movie was really boring , which i found odd , given the number of people watching me . it ' s all so funny , yet i don ' t know much about it . then again , how else are you supposed to know if someone is on your side against them ? i guess it wouldn ' t be worth trying to write one down .|0
i thought godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity . my friends and i went to see what it was all about when we started watching it last summer at our house . it was such a nightmare ! they were all screaming horrible horror movies for fun as they did n't have any idea what else they could say to get out of their lives . oh , and there are always two sides to every story on the set . it is funny in a twisted kind of way but i would never go through with this if i did not really enjoy it .|0
rivalry between brothers leads to main story line . navy commander chuck prescott ( marshall thompson ) has developed the ability and will be a part of the military career in the future by becoming an ex - navy officer . he can be one of many officers involved with the nsf . he is highly regarded as being the best soldier in the military . i have seen many movies about these two guys , but i never believed them to be that good . they were very different . this one was more intense and aggressive than what i had been watching for several weeks now .|0
To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.And, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors.|1
"Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. Not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious (""movie horror helps us deal with real horror"", ""you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre"") and pretty trite. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring."|1
great acting , great production values , good direction . but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the dialogue . that is the story where the character ( s ) takes a wrong turn after being beaten up by the enemy ( s ) , or gets into an accident on the highway . this is quite a scene , which is pretty good . if you look at it , you can see what might have happened ; the driver would have been put to death . no one knows how to do that , as well . the main character , however , has a problem .|0
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer due to this film. I have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. I would rather watch Star Crystal....... Holy cow maybe that is not a good example. The main question I have about this film is... Was it to be a morality film?|1
Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work.|1
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh OK I'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'Nightbeast' emerges, OK so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people.|1
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget.|1
five fingers is so bad , that i hardly know where to begin . so let me admit first , it was a great movie . i really want to see it again someday . i just have a feeling that it will take place and that it may not be the same film . in any case , after viewing the original movies for one or two hours , i was able to get my mind off of the film as much as possible . i got tired of trying to turn up the volume . i am sure that most people are disappointed with what i have done .|0
I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so.What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.Where to start? Okay..1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) No ricochet.|1
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down.|1
this movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films , most likely to get the hang of it . when i got out of the theater that day i had more to do than just watch it . i could have done two dozen different scenes , and i still do n't know why i chose this movie as a character for a movie . but it was nice having the opportunity to go out with my friends . they all really liked the movie and went out to see it . the main character seemed to be quite good , and she is a beautiful girl .|0
This Blake Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of Julie Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release.|1
"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be."|1
ok , a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining . could i please watch this film with someone else ? do you mind ? we were just trying to get to know each other in a way that was comfortable for us . i did some thinking , and as far as i can tell , i thought i had more than enough to make me forget who i was dating . i never really got a good picture of what he looked like . it all seemed so trivial and stupid compared to what i was being subjected to .|0
"Honestly, I don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. It embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. The storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit ""Fast"", that is a good thing.Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easily as good as Tom Baker.Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela.I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus."|1
"it is truly saddening to see a once - great director such as deodato delivering such a second - rate giallo such as this . even if he does , the actors are not nearly as good as the actors they were hired for . i can understand why that film should be treated with more contempt than any other . in fact , we have seen and heard a lot of negative things about our production , and it was very disheartening to watch the film take so long . however , we also saw a lot of good stuff about you , don "" t get my hopes up ."|0
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed.|1
This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film.|1
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki- bashing in the film, this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki- bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music.|1
i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago , and it remains one of my all - time faves ! well , not quite , but in this case it is ' a very good horror movie ' . the characters are so funny you might have to call it a ' good comedy ' . i could really appreciate an excellent plot that would keep me from making a mistake . i just like to think that this movie is much better because of the fact that it was made under the cover of darkness as opposed to the harsh light that usually comes off the theatre screen .|0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. It is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.Not quite ten years after the film, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work.|1
"i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got . the acting was just awful , and as usual , the actors were all in the same line : "" hey , you wanna take me shopping ? "" i found the whole thing very annoying . why did n't they just give me a script to write a script about ? or maybe they thought that i would do it , but they should have given me an audition instead . either way , i am tired of this crap . i think i might have been sick to my stomach once in awhile before , but nothing like this ."|0
"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material."|1
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock, it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: ""He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour."" The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police. ""Strangers on a Train"" is probably one of the best in his ""wrongly-accused"" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series."|1
what a waste of energy and money . what a waste of what talent there was . emilio estevez was completely wasted as he tried to figure out how to pay for the food that was available to him at the time it cost $ 25 , 000 to buy in the first place . i can not understand why this is considered so important when people just do not get credit for it at all . i must say that i had seen this movie on my phone many times . it was a popular movie and everyone loved it .|0
i went to this film having no idea what to expect . i actually took a date to it in order to meet up with you and get into this movie . i also was not happy that the movie started out like this ; it was so dull and boring . i have to admit that i loved this film - i never really cared much for movies , mainly because i only ever saw one movie , which made me want to skip it altogether . as for the second movie , i hated the first three . i had no idea how bad the movie was .|0
what can i say ? ? this movie has it all . . . romance , break - ups , rich kids , punks , and other people that you should be afraid to mention . a lot of the characters are weird , and very interesting , but they are not really scary . just boring . one of the guys i was friends with when i was in high school used to joke that he was going to kill himself after being married for almost five years . i would never let someone do that to me or anyone at school .|0
If you're looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there, don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here.|1
this film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a american dad . so , you can either ' ve just been given a script that makes sense or you don ' t even remember how to talk . what happened here in the dark room was totally different from any movie i ' ve ever seen . there is absolutely no character and none of the drama . the only thing that could be worse than an american hero trying to get into iraq is an israeli agent shooting a man who shot at him . that ' s really bad for movies .|0
Underwoods goofy story about a young man(Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, Arquette is annoying throughout, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. It is full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand next to lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good.|1
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.Where does this film go wrong?|1
first of all i dunno if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was just being a prick . whatever . the movie was fine but the characters were awful . at first , the plot seemed more like a bad dream then a movie that needed to be re - made , so the actors did n't even look like they were on the verge of doing something good ( though i guess most of them ' d ) . it went downhill pretty quickly , and there were some horrible scenes for me to enjoy .|0
oh boy . films like this really bother me . if this movie is supposed to close to truth , i think it 's a stupid idea . you should have seen the first six or seven movies that were written and re - written in this book . those people who do n't look like actors need to work very hard to make this film as good as they can on tv . the only person who did n't look like characters in this movie was david bowie . he just happens to be one of the premiere directors for the show . i mean , seriously , his character is an ass .|0
This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades.|1
This is one of the best martial art(Kung-fu) movies of all time. if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. From flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line. Its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the shaoulin fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts. after killing key members of the shaoulin temple the faith of the shoulin is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a shaoulin monk.|1
the recent documentary ` ` the adventures of errol flynn ' ' is an in - depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero . this was not supposed to happen until after christmas and it just did . the story ( the movie ) has been put off for too long . however , as a writer i can understand that it could not have happened sooner had it been done sooner . you will be aware that some of the stories were based on reality , which would have been good but this one made no sense whatsoever .|0
this self - important , confusing b + w ` ` film ' ' watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip . you should be able to read it , but do n't get me started ! the only thing that makes sense is that they would have had no idea of its existence . however , it is not easy to make a movie based on this genre of movies . i was born and raised in paris in 1974 and am still in good shape . there is absolutely no reason for them to be producing anything else than what they were making when they started out .|0
this film has made e mad . i believe the original of this film , ' the mask ' , was made by a guy called john smith . he is very famous and works on his second film , ' the monster in the basement . ' we were disappointed to discover that they still do not seem to be able to produce what they had hoped to achieve . there seems to be no resolution with this film , although we did find a couple of other great films , but they have been too short - lived for me to enjoy .|0
let me tell you something . . . this movie exceeds all of the troma laugh and gore movies hands down as an indie film . i found this film to be incredibly lame , so i have to sit back and watch it for hours . well , i can totally do better . . . that is if anyone would care to watch it . . . . a great deal of time passed before i realized what i had got myself into . the story of how my parents died does not begin with any of the stories i have experienced in the series .|0
if anyone has any doubts about the talent of liev schrieber , just a look at his new film , and you know what they 're thinking ? we 're not ready for it . in fact , there will be little chance of it ever being finished . why should it be ? it 's a stupid waste of money . i 'm not going to give a damn that it ' s about a guy who killed a woman and turned himself in . i just hope it works out because some of the good movies are just so lame . this is only the beginning .|0
"i will leave it to my bettors , uhh , betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful masterpiece . ' you are the world 's greatest screenwriter ! "" she paused . "" how many movies has that number been made ? "" a few people laughed at her pun , which only made her laugh even more . as an actor , most of the comedies in the book have their share of laughs . for me , it just makes me feel worse . if this movie were a normal comedy , where do we begin ? i have always enjoyed the movies , but this film is terrible ."|0
i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel , but if they really believe in the ancient hebrew bible , why would they want a picture of moses having sex ? there must be something much harder to understand than that ! . this book was written with the idea that ' the good lord ' would lead god to protect his son jesus christ from the sins of his people . the book was a complete waste of time and we may as well have had it made for them .|0
"As a rule, I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them. I made no exceptions with ""Tart"", doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.It failed for a number of reasons. Firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category. Thirdly, the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling, it really was."|1
it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen , and who will die . it is very hard to do if they are not real . it may have something to do with how fast time goes by that i did not really notice until then . there were a lot of people doing drugs on the same day and they were all stoned out of their minds . when i saw the scene in the video , the first thing that i knew about the drug lords was that they smoked a lot of them and had some trouble getting rid of the other dealers .|0
"I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of ""High Octane"" cop shows such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series."|1
Now, I love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. Surely no one actually WROTE dialogue this pointless.|1
This story starts at the end ! So the film's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950's. The story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.The story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke.|1
"I just watched this, an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his ""glasses"" character on Kino Video's DVD of ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"". He's actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake séances. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are ""lost"". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits."|1
One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent.|1
"While I hold its predecessor, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High,"" as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, ""The Wild Life"" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, ""From the makers of FTARH, something even faster."" This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, ""The Wild Life"" is, nonetheless, a great flick."|1
as muppet movies go , this is easily and clearly the best . it features loads of cameos by big george ' s characters . one of the worst in this movie was how bad it tasted . no wonder the audience laughed . the last thing on the planet that they wanted was to hear a movie where the people are being beaten to death for their entertainment . however , this film did have good acting and had a lot of plot . you would n't think that some of these films would be so scary . well , it just happens to be the worst yet .|0
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. He meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. The group which is called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene.|1
because that ' s what hell ride pretty much is . larry bishop and tarantino partying on the weinstein ' s money . i think they ' re right about one thing . they don ' t really want to know what this film is like . all they want is a good time with a nice blonde girl for their first date . well anyway , i guess if you ' re going to be in hollywood , it ' s best to go out with a beautiful young woman who is gorgeous and smart . but there are some bad boys in there .|0
hard justice is an excellent action movie ! the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it looks real good at the same time . when the credits finally rolled we were so excited to get a second chance that we did n't care if people would die for it . i was in such a good mood that night that i had no choice but to watch it . this film is one of those films from the early twentieth century . as you know , it does have a happy ending but also has a terrible ending .|0
This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock.|1
Brilliant Aussie movie... A little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line, as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening...|1
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.|1
Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the President-elect's wife, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the First Lady dead. This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President.|1
i ca n ' t believe some of the comments here in the reviews . the film is dated of course , but the characters are n't too much different from other movies . we have no idea if this was made as a joke or a comedy at that time , but it looked like a really stupid movie . i just wanted to watch the film without worrying about how my husband could be accused of something such as making fun of me for not getting into his good graces . the story itself is fairly predictable , and i guess there is some truth to what some people say .|0
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that ""cranked out"" is written all over this production. Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent."|1
Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the mostly negative responses I've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy DVD release, I couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit.|1
"'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in ""Fires in the Mirror"").Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them, than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say."|1
Boy Oh Boy, does this movie stink. This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. Only watch this thing when it comes on as a MST 3000 Episode. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to watch it without that show, I would've stopped watching it before it was over.|1
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down a arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), things go wrong though & Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US Government. After a big shoot-out most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about, top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US & at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also being sent back to the US.|1
i ' m a large scarred heterosexual male ex - bouncer , ex - rugby player , and ex - boxer , and i love this movie . it is absolutely beautiful ! there is so much about the world we live in that i find interesting , but it does not really give me anything useful to write about . as an urban legend , i had two very good relationships with a man , and i think one of them was broken after a few months . he moved to canada ( where he became an astronaut ) and worked as a journalist in the same city .|0
well . . . it ' s about time ! van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that ' s his best work ever ! i can see why he wanted to get a sequel out of this . i never expected such a huge fan reaction from you , and i am especially sorry for how the book ended . after seeing this movie , i feel like an idiot - but i want to say all the right things because i have been thinking something similar on several occasions . i thought this one was too close to the story line .|0
Oh boy. Where do I begin on this piece of slime? This is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that I've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...For the first thing, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot.|1
"From the start of ""The Edge Of Love"", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance."|1
honestly - this short film sucks . the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still looks like a real character , and you could see that even though it 's actually a lot more funny than anything else , you should be paying attention in order to make any sense of it . if you go to an empty cinema you can see where the actors were working ( i saw one of the actors at the theater once ; there was a man ) so you can see what he was doing or trying to work out what it was .|0
excellent story , wonderful acting , amazing production values and a cool , action - packed short with a perfect twist at the end . it was so good that i had to close my eyes and go to sleep . ( of course i 'm not going to admit it , but if you have n't read this stuff , then you should see how great this movie is . ) i do n't want to be saying these things when they get published , but the first thing i did every time i saw this movie was run through the film projector in the library .|0
"This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?"" It's that bad."|1
i was n ' t expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a complete mystery story . the whole thing just did n't make sense . no matter where i went in my life , i always knew that i was destined to find out more about what happened here or even the reason for the movie . you can see it if you have been living here your entire life and have never come across something like this . how could there possibly be anything remotely similar to this ? i do not understand this at all .|0
i ' m from texas so i thought i knew big hair , but the female villain in this movie had a little too much to drink . she got on her knees in front of her brother , trying to grope him . it looked like some sort of horror film , and she did n't care if he made her suffer for it or not . there were plenty of other girls out there who actually enjoyed watching this chick flick . after that i was happy to let this one have her own personal life . i found a lot of things about the film boring .|0
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow. I would not think about going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn french anyhow because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I rather go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language just like me. Therefore I will not bother the France trip no matter what.|1
i ca n ' t believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely did not expect the script . it was so bad i had to turn it down for a couple hours . i just could n't believe my eyes when i read the ending . i thought it would be funny to watch how people acted in the movie , but it only made me wonder what i was supposed to do as a character . it was very boring , and there were no funny characters that i could come across on the cover or any of the other films i watched .|0
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election. CBS's last shot at throwing a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful yet I'm still watching it. **Minor Spoiler** I think CBS got the same people who ""provided"" the memo's to do the semi cut in half sequence. What is with the bad boyfriend storyline? Can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a Ed Wood movie. Who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing."|1
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe, so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy).|1
"this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen . i was not aware of any connection to the movie before , but when i looked at it in the library today , there were several links to the movie . i am surprised that no one else knew about the movies ' history , or even what they do and how they got there . it was so horrible that i could not imagine seeing such an episode . i spent the morning with my mother trying to keep myself occupied by watching the movie . after a short while she asked me what i was doing . """|0
love this little film , that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem , shall we dance ? ( i think you should have seen the first half of the film and i do not doubt it for a second . ) at some point in the next few hours i must say i am deeply disappointed in the film : if i was a great actress before , now i will be a fool to even see it again . why waste good money making movies like this ? i just don ' t know what i am doing or how i actually managed to get myself into this mess .|0
a spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons development . is there any reason to suspect that aliens may actually be hiding in the jungles of africa ? ! ? i will tell you something else , it really does not make any sense . why would somebody want to hide on a world that has been made with the ability to create such a weapon as a laser gun ? if they wanted to come to the amazon jungle then they should have at least brought a few boxes of ammunition .|0
i ca n ' t remember the series , i believe it may have been ` ` american masters ' ' , but it 's all meaningless now . i 'm really just glad you didn ' t have any luck with that . it ' s a great thriller , but i ' m sorry i was too slow to see it . please forgive me if i don ' t find this interesting , but why were you interested in the script ? we are told that there is not one single thing about the movie which appeals to the general audience . how did they get such a bad production ?|0
"if you ' re looking for a typical war movie , this is not it , so a note to all of you who have never heard of it has to do with the war movies : i love war movies , but i was just too young and inexperienced to know any of them . what i find interesting is how people actually act like they "" love war movies "" when there ' s no such thing in these films . as i was saying , i loved the battle scenes . but that didn ' t make any sense to me until the end of the movie ( or whatever it was called ) ."|0
this film sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards? I couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes their entire armoury and disappears again!! Nice work if you can get it. It's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. Arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film.|1
I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance.|1
i rented this movie for about $ 1 . 50 - the most complete waste of money ( and time ) i have seen on any of the movies since 2006 . it was just too bad when i thought the movie was done . if you like a horror movie then you really should watch it with a dvd player . one thing that makes me love this movie is how much money it actually has . it could have been better in its first few years , maybe even longer . the only thing that saved this movie from being a total disaster was the overall quality of the actors .|0
"for a really wonderful movie , you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of assisi - good quality films that would have made this movie feel like a bad one . unfortunately , it did not , and the character never even made a move . i know how stupid it is to watch a bad movie , especially after having watched such awful movies over the years : "" oh no , this is worse than bad ! this movie was just awful ! what kind of person are you to go and do something so wrong ? "" those are all very important reasons why i loved this movie ."|0
this movie was so poorly acted . what was with jeff bridges accent , horrible and unbelievable . was it because of the actors in the movie that we found ourselves staring at ? i had an idea where all this was coming from . as a kid i spent lots of time trying to figure out how anyone could get away with making something so bad ( except for those parts where they were really awful ) . but the truth is that i never actually thought it through . even after i saw the film , i just could not make any sense of it .|0
Terror in the Jungle is a real find. If you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. It's hilarious!The story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. The crash scene has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blonde boy survives. A nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! I kid you NOT!|1
Yes sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, I really enjoyed it.|1
"The basic idea behind ""Dungeon of Harrow"" isn't all bad. The acting, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really isn't much there to recommend this film. You know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say ""Special Guest Star"" and list someone you've never heard of. Might as well say ""Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln."" because there's really no one in this movie you can identify."|1
The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this.|1
Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that.|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act!|1
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.|1
I've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. I feel it's a waste of time to even write this but I'll make it short. Why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurly directed and cut. 2. Bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clichés. 4. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. Bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6.|1
eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year ' s cannibal ferox . the characters are universally horrible and their behavior is not good . it appears that the script has taken on an even worse cast than the movies they were used to . i was n't expecting to see that from a movie of my own . after all this time watching a film that i thought i had seen , i never would have anticipated what it would bring about . the first thing that strikes me as weird is the number of people who take a seat in the middle of the bus .|0
I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following reply: From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net Dear Kate, I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country.|1
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries, odds are you will find this one fascinating. Not only does it have a well-mapped out plot that while easy to follow, contains its interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured.That being said, if you know nothing of Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single-handers boat race around the world...as was the case for me...please stop reading, and rent/view this film.|1
"This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of ""we're just a bunch of wacky guys"" in the midst of the ""my goodness this can be really dangerous"" parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn't bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.Thing is I'm a John Travolta fan."|1
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example: When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain, I was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it. Nothing! Are you kidding me? A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations. Overall, small children will enjoy this, parents will endure it without too much complaining.|1
the vietnam war era is certainly far before my time , but it has always interested me , and i have never seen one of those movies where a bunch of guys fight each other , and they just all end up dead - not that i really believe in this kind of thing . i suppose you could say i find the movie quite entertaining . the story starts off as a family man , and after he is defeated by his mother , her father , then their son , who she is close to , they try to get away with it .|0
I can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots...oh, the wackyness! And watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp'!|1
This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could take it back where I got it from.|1
i ' m a big fan of the demonic puppets . looking at the surface of this one , it looks like someone has taken a sledgehammer to his heart . but what was in it for me ? i think i ' d rather enjoy myself in the movies . and there ' s no way i could have known this movie would get as boring as this one . even worse , some of the scenes on the screen just weren ' t quite the same because they had been filmed differently . most were about demons or witches or something like that .|0
yeah , what did i expect ? i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning - point in life . you see , when most people turn sixteen or fifteen , they have to learn how to make a baby . the only thing they learn is that having sex makes them look older than they actually are . no one really wants to make a baby . it just happens to be a great movie and does n't pay attention to all of the details . i found out later that the first time we tried to make a baby was for two weeks .|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter.|1
"After the failure of ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth,"" the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs UNDER 90 minutes... On display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched B-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while STILL attempting to keep the whole project completely serious."|1
"This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.He also loves his mommy. So, to keep the money coming in, he takes his act to Broadway.SEE! CODY POWERS JARRETT BLOW HIMSELF UP ON HIS BIGGEST GAS CONTAINER YET! TONIGHT! 7.30PM! However, one day, his mommy dies and Jarrett goes berserk. He kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas cylinder.Losing control further, he makes them all scream ""MADE IT MA, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!"""|1
"...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. I've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that I have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with ""Gone"" isn't happy with what I had to say. So, I've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: """"Gone"" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words."|1
this is an unfortunately unrecognized classic . the look is superb , the design , costumes etc are flawless , the post - movie effects are absolutely amazing and even the scenes that do not match up quite seem to me like they really should . i had no clue what it was about . i just loved it ! i never realized that any of this was possible until i watched it on television in 1975 . as a result , i thought for a few minutes that the script could be more realistic if we did it in full . this is where the plot gets screwed up .|0
"Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought ""Well if he likes it then I gotta like it!"" So I rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy)."|1
you may not believe this , but when the credits to this movie rolled , i looked for the director who was supposed to appear . they had n't made it back yet and were on their way to the house of lords by 3 pm . i went to my car and found an apartment complex where i rented a few rooms . it was about 45 minutes from the house of lords and its location was only 15 minutes away from the house of lords . i lived there for a couple of months until i heard that they were going to pay me to watch the film .|0
"i ' m not sure whether i like this film or not . i think it is creepy and completely weird . crispin is the reason why i hate movies that have no plot to them . it ' s stupid and boring and makes me want to punch something . if you wish for a good comedy of any kind , this would be one of those "" crime movies "" with lots of explosions , blood , screaming and death . i love this movie , because it brings about a great change from the horror films in this city ."|0
"I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote ""i also expected a Steven movie"", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. In had a little doubts cause i read that ""Ja Rule"" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. And offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. Steven was broke and needed cash?"|1
"OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this film. But it was so boring, that I nearly felt asleep. Sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yeah, for a B-Movie it is not that bad. After having seen her in ""Marquise"" some years ago (also a very crappy film), I thought that she would play more convincingly."|1
i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years . i had never seen this adaptation , so i did not know how to watch it from the room behind me . unfortunately , in this film , the narrator and heroine are both very different , but they can not be more different . after all , this movie was based on a novel written by two women . this book is obviously going to be the last time i watched this one . well done , boys , if you 're looking forward to making a movie , you better watch this one !|0
"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? ""Who?"" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off."|1
i generally like sion sono ' s work , but this movie was completely retarded . but sadly , not retarded . there were plenty of jokes to go around . it was a horror movie and it just did not get any better than the one where the actor tries to make everyone believe that he actually invented the plot . even worse than that , however , is the fact that the character never really knew anything about this movie . why do people tell you stuff like this in movies ? because they all think it 's funny .|0
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, you'd thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good.|1
the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges . the story is told by an american author and he portrays the film as a bad one . this movie has the worst ending i have ever read . it is not funny at all . there is no ' b ' rating for this kind of film . what do you like about this movie ? i mean really , where did this movie come from ? why did it take such a long time ? should n't it be filmed in a different genre ? how old were the people on the film when it first came out ?|0
all the reviewers are making one big mistake . this movie was not suppose to be taken seriously . it was made for children and adults alone , and they really should have at least brought them in on the premise , instead of leaving them with a bunch of half - truths about how to do something other than go to school . i feel bad for these kids who did what they were paid to do - but i also feel sure that if anyone would have told you the story you would have laughed . i guess that is what makes the movie so good .|0
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy.|1
"froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids . spanky and the gang get together one night , and it looks as though they 're having a good time . i was hoping you could join them ? "" "" how can i not want to come ? "" says my mom . "" i do n't even know where this movie is going to end - i only saw it yesterday . i do n't want to see anything bad about this movie . "" her voice quivers as she talks about the film ."|0
i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career , but ` ` the end ' is n't much different from the beginning of this movie . a couple of weeks earlier it would be hard to imagine that he would have done such a brilliant job at keeping his own personal life from becoming too much of a nuisance to the fans . now that he has finally gone above and beyond the call of duty , i think this movie will make me feel better about what he has been saying all this time .|0
i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful ! ! , as it ' s one of the first films i ' m watching that will ever put in a movie at all . i did not see this film because there were n't any people and i watched it only because it ' s an old film that has seen a lot of action and tragedy over the years . i had my suspicions since the very beginning about this film being the most terrible horror film in history , but i thought it would be more fun if i had seen the original version , even if i never saw the original .|0
jack higgins ' straightforward thriller about a guilt - ridden ira bomber forced into ` ` one last job ' ' ( where have you been ? ) . when i first read it , the story was so exciting that i thought maybe i wanted to stay a writer instead of making an honest living in hollywood . now , if you had seen this movie , would you say that these things were really real ? and if you watched this movie , do you think you knew anything about how it was done ? i do n't want to give you a straight answer .|0
Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture.|1
"eXistenZ was a good film, at the first I was wondering what is going on, organic ""pods"" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.But once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.Security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !"|1
I did have some expectations from this film because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star(??!) cast was new. Well, I must tell u that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that).|1
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome.|1
"Mixed group of ""experts"" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. The cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-aiming effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels."|1
Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By the way, what has become of Ms. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry.This to me was almost like an 1850s version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver takes a position as a governess to a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity.While I realize that this is a period peace, it was awfully dull even for 1850 England and Scotland.The lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers.|1
"For once a sequel to ""The Karate Kid"" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process."|1
"i saw this film via one of the actors ' agents , and it surely conforms with a great deal about the movie ( which is really nothing at all to my taste ) . if i did n't watch this video , i would've started to feel sorry for him after seeing his performance . in fact , you would be amazed how many people who do n't know their movie are fooled into thinking that it is what they really mean by "" acting "" . while he is very good - looking , he seems a little out of his element ."|0
"and there are not many in cinema history. ""Rouge"" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in mankind and in life. But to say only that may be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces."|1
i ' ve been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now . when a writer develops a story like this , something changes in my mind . the character has to be put together quickly , that ' s why i did it . this story is about how a person discovers his real life by going out into the night to find someone who ' s missing and finds them wandering around in a crowd of drunks , acting as if they belong in a bar . he ' s looking for someone to tell him what he needs to know about himself and where he wants to live .|0
even my five year old was bored . very predictable , and overacted . this movie could n ' t make up it ' s life . i had to leave a little early for the bus back to the motel . i ' d only slept for about three hours , and that was n't much sleep for someone who was going to die soon anyway . at the moment , i was still tired and cranky . i thought i would try to catch a nap and spend time with my wife . in fact , i ' ll be lucky if i get any rest at all .|0
"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic! ), than the man alone...) and to link the ""adventures"" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying ""Oh, a boat!"") were awful."|1
OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality?|1
sacchi is the best bogart impersonator ever . . . dry and droll as sam marlowe . the music from award winning movies has many more twists in the script , but that is not important at the moment . all that matters is that the movie will be played out , and i hope to get a few good reviews from the producers . if you like this show , go to the back of the theatre where you will find a couple of other characters ( and a director ) . there are so many scenes that it would be really hard to tell which of these guys is the real star .|0
I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos.|1
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best one), I was looking forward to see this film. I didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv I'm terribly happy I resisted buying it on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in Dutch film history. All the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. All humour has been cut out.|1
I was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! Truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films.I did think this one was a bit too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to Caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference.|1
Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction.|1
i just watched this movie last night . within 30 minutes of the start , i was hoping it would take me away from home for a while but it did not . i do not have time to play these kinds of movies so if you had seen this before , then you probably know what is next . this movie was based on something called the civil war which has taken place over 20 years . as you may be aware , there was a huge explosion in the 1920s . according to this film , the whole world is now gone .|0
"""Mr. Bean"", starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was around ten, shortly after it ended, so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes!"|1
"Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"" I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed."|1
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class. The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.|1
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it.|1
this movie had potential . if it had been handled differently . what it needed was a different director . i never heard of anyone trying to get someone to write an action - flick . not that i ever actually watched it . i just thought it was interesting . well , there is something about the characters in these films . they are really good . i ca n't even find out which ones are really great or how many roles are played in the movie . one thing i do know : no matter how good the plot is , it ends up ending in a horribly ugly horror movie .|0
hey guys and girls ! do n ' t ever rent , or may god forbid , buy this piece of garbage ! there are too many variables , and the only way we can find out what is going to happen next is to go through the channels and watch a movie . we have no reason to believe anything good could ever happen to anyone . but i am still trying to get a hold of someone who actually has a job that pays . my best guess is that he spends his waking hours with his girlfriend and then goes on a trip to africa .|0
i really enjoyed this movie - i like prison movies in general ( i ' m not sure why - - i thought they were funny ) . the characters are all pretty , the plot is fairly good and there are some strange things going on with people . however , when i looked at the movie i thought about my wife and children ; it seemed weird to see how many people were present . the acting was much better but it didn ' t take long for the bad actors to get sucked back into their own lives .|0
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special. The acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.However, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles.|1
please . . . if anybody gets the chance to read this before watching the movie , if it can be called that , i 'll take it in my head . there is a great movie in the series . they really like the film because we are having so many fun times with each other and trying hard to enjoy all of the shows . i had to stop watching these shows long ago , since i was too depressed to watch the first one , which i think is hilarious as you can imagine . anyway , here is some pretty good stuff . . . .|0
"I'm originally from Brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. They told his life story and he never got one ""centavo"" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in Brazil. Sad... but that is the world we live in. It's about making money not saving lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most probably... dead. We tend to want to live in this ""Disney filled fantasy bubbled life""."|1
"I've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read "" better than save private ryan""....mmmmm ...i thought cool! guys....is just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun. Nothing to do with a proper war movie. I want my money back! Why the f...k the peoples lies??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light....but they didn't make it. Sorry about this.....but the movie is awful."|1
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y.|1
this film is just another waste of time . the plot is ridiculous , forced usa drama . the characters are totally lacking in subtlety and originality . if i were on television and watched this film , i might have taken umbrage when they tried to make funny things out of everything . my opinion would be a lot more reasonable if i was watching this movie with someone who did not know what they were doing . it would also be much more believable if they had gone forward with their story and made a good story . this film will be no different .|0
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Indeed, his sort of daft giddiness bears, to this writer, the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when Mickey is holding down the button in the Tardis), yet brings his own aloof superiority a la McCoy's Doctor as he lets events coalesce around him.|1
"Well,this movie is really ""PLUMPED"" HAHA Get it? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if ""PLUMP"" (haha)! is really unbelievable.The storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. It did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. I mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh."|1
i ' m really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie . do n ' t get me wrong , it ' s a fantastic movie and you ' re not going to stop the movie , but there is just no way that the audience would ever be interested in your personal life . the cast is such a mess that they make no sense at all ! one of the worst scenes of the film actually starts off as a romantic comedy starring a young woman who has lost her job and is struggling to stay afloat .|0
"this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare . i was so tired that i went to bed after having a long , sleepless night . when it was time to wake up , i tried to make myself get ready for school . since i had no money , i started buying expensive and expensive things . my mom is going to be mad when she sees what i bought . "" you should buy some nice clothes , "" my mom says at the mall . "" i thought you were not interested in anything like that ."|0
i do n ' t normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy , and maybe i will in the future , but now i have no clue who is making this movie . for a change , it seems to me that it can be made to make an entire movie without much effort . however , there was something very special about this particular movie . after the movie , the camera went into high gear and the crew looked like they were trying really hard not to laugh hysterically at the scenes going on around them .|0
"In case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. That's pretty much the extent of the movie. Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and ""NYPD Blue's"" Jimmy Smits."|1
one of the reviewers here wrote : ` ` good acting , good special effects , greatlocation . even better ending . ' do i get to write something like this ? if i were a normal person , i might laugh about it . but not today . today , i just want to be on the outside looking at the great work that is happening in the world with this new piece of art . when you spend time on the outside looking at the beauty of this painting , you come across some really interesting things and feel as if you will never see or speak to them again .|0
when i went to see this i thought , i liked the first two and thought that they were very interesting but the third one is even better . in the second film i was extremely impressed by the fact that it showed a lot more of people in real life than it showed as a movie on tv . however , at the time it did not really capture what i was getting at for the first film . instead it just shows about five different scenes . then i had this feeling that i had seen a whole bunch of movies before but nothing like this .|0
surprisingly well - acted , well - written movie about hard rockin ' - but - decent young man getting that much - hoped - for ticket to stardom : his favorite heavy metal concert . it just does n't ring true . there are too many things wrong with it . i want you to take a look here and see what you will find . if you like this movie you should be grateful that i selected it as a cinematic film . it is based around an amazing collection of contemporary movies ( one of the most original in existence ) .|0
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not, admittedly, all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.Nonetheless, we haven't seen it filmed this well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.I was reading Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."|1
it ' s a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into production . i never expected to see this coming out of hollywood . in fact , that ' s about all i had ever been told on tv or in movies . i never expected that i would be watched so closely . this is an extremely bad way to spend your life . you are either very close to losing your mind or completely oblivious to everything around you . at any given point , you could hear someone speaking to you but it was impossible to decipher the words .|0
this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life . a woman ` ` the girl ' , and she is not even supposed to be alive . i don ' t think anyone can say it is that bad . what is really awful about the film is the way people are acting . i just don ' t know how many people are willing to make the effort to make a good movie . it ' s like trying to make a good story out of someone you already know or at least know something about .|0
the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens , and more contemporary art than i can believe that this film has had in over twenty years . but then again , maybe i never really did see the movies . perhaps i have been trying so hard to block out the past and get on with my life that it takes me a while to see the movie in the light of day . i suppose there were some good people in the world who enjoyed this movie when they saw it , but i 've seen them quite a bit .|0
"BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - ""MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE"") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ""ALL THAT"") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. As a matter of fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay erroneously ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo."|1
a beautiful film . one that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed . made me wonder if god had a hand in everything that went on around here . i am the only one who has seen what is happening here today . and it is awful . terrible ! my mother and father and grandmother were out for many days without any contact with anyone at all . their house was completely dark . no electricity , tv or anything else . they must have left some sort of light on in the home , i thought as i looked out the window .|0
"After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It wasn't ""heartwarming"" or ""clever""; it was merely an amalgam of every other ""mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other"" movie ever made.The characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse -- We have the Blacks, the Hispanics, The Jews, The Asians, and the Homosexuals -- and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do."|1
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I found myself very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all let me preface my review with the fact that I love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era.|1
"Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. Some scenes are not ""nice"" or ""beautiful"", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what's happening here. The camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst."|1
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation.|1
"""Scientists at a remote lab experiment on (insert scaly creature here) and create out of control monsters. In the meantime a crack military team/the scientist's daughter/bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters. One by one they're eaten, all during an ""exciting"" race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters..."" The sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel. I have to wonder just what is going on? Sure..."|1
"Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia ""goodness"" in the form of this soft-core Cinemax non-classic.A numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a ""black hole"" as the intelligent dolts put it. Pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. Pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.Ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin."|1
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too.|1
i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in birmingham , al , which was actually a really cool movie and it was made in france . you want to know what the story is ? i do n't know for sure but it seems that there are many people trying to get an idea of why it was made and why they wanted it to be done . the director tells these people to write about the film or how they ' ve been dying to watch it and how they ' re going to kill the whole bunch of us with their poison .|0
"This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of ""Touching the Void"", one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event, and I'm relieved that it didn't let me down."|1
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a cast containing such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. HOWEVER, I am so glad that I did view this film as I now have the memorable saying 'Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by.|1
This movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. This kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. Only thing I appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career.|1
this is one of the most laughably bad films i ' ve ever seen . i can not believe whoever wrote this did so in such a foul way , it would have been so much more original if it could be made up in any other genre . to my great disappointment it has never even occurred to anyone as to what kind of film it should actually be written on , let alone the subject of it itself . why bother when it is not going to be published ? well , i just thought that it would at least give someone something to think about besides me and my poor attempt to write anything .|0
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one.|1
"son of the mask is a terrible movie . i do n ' t like the baby and i do n ' t like the guy , so when the time comes to leave , i have to be ready to run . "" "" what was the story about ? "" asked mike . 
 "" it 's not a simple story . i know all the bad characters in it as well as any of the others who worked on this show . let 's just say that i really hated this show . i think i might have an ounce of hate left in me ."|0
one of my favorites non - mgm musicals , it ' s a classic ! > rita hayworth is in top form , with her hair in a high bun on the top of her skull and her body moving quickly . i like to think she made it out here because there was no way i would let anyone steal my movie for any reason . if you love a woman who makes her own films , you really do need to see this movie . i could have been so happy when i first saw it as part of the ' star wars ' series , but i did not agree .|0
"What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one.The story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. Like the surf ""dudes"" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about that you NEVER saw them surf once!!"|1
` ` nicodemus ' ' is almost a copy of ` ` red ' ' in the odd behavior sense , but this episode goes much worse than i thought . there are many things you ca n't understand before you get into an old age , and these are only one of them . once it gets down to the part where she was on her way to meet us , all hell breaks loose . no one knows exactly how long it would take her to get there , but from what i can tell they were both very excited to find that she had made it this far .|0
Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. Actually it sort of stinks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. Characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good.|1
"This is an odd movie. On the surface it's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out. Firstly, the main killer character is really weird. How the heck a guy who only ever clucks like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me. What was that female parole board member thinking: ""he's totally reformed and rehabilitated"". He clucks! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script/direction for the women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine I'ld slap her."|1
"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but I must say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, yet all is not as it seems; a sort of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things an people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis, and thought, ""this can't be the whole reason?"""|1
"Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the ""Female Scorpion"" series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. ""Beast Stable"" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before, or after, has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes and filming styles."|1
if you ' re tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you ' ll learn to appreciate the good quality of the movie . for this reason , the film is based on the story of how a couple tries to have a happy ending and finds that it was not successful . this film is completely different from what i saw in any of these other movies . i knew that the only reason i made it was because of the fact that i didn ' t want anyone to see the movie or be disappointed in the production of it .|0
i work at memorial hermann hospital ( tmc ) and was also working at texas children ' s hospital , women 's hospital , that kind of place . after my husband died in a plane crash , i decided not to follow in his footsteps as a psychiatrist . i thought this would be better for me , especially when i started talking to people and found out i could speak english well enough . but instead , i ended up doing things that would make you feel like you were sitting there in an episode of the exorcist .|0
"When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(Richard Johnson of ""Zombi 2"" fame),a mad scientist(Joseph Cotten),his beautiful daughter(Barbara Bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.The tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.And though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."|1
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard about this movie before. Simply, I lost track of Seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. Here, again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. The plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. I simply don't have any idea why Seagal did this movie.|1
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career.|1
"Yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny. ""Night Hunter"" is basically about Jack Cutter, a Vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires.This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes."|1
"after an astronaut dies in space , he is brought back to a military base . inside the man are his friends . the three of them go off on some crazy escapades . i know what you mean by "" insane "" but that is quite another story . it just so happens that my ex - girlfriend was kidnapped and subjected to these things as a child . i really am sorry that i could not save her , but i did manage to save her life . now she 's going to die , so how do i help her ?"|0
"i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get me killed . unfortunately , after seeing this film , i wanted to go back to college and make my first film . instead , i decided to wait for the right moment and take the plunge into the "" good old days "" . i wrote a screenplay about an indian village and some indians who lived there . then i met this guy who lives in san francisco . i was so embarrassed by this movie that i turned off my phone and left it in my hotel room with my overnight bag ."|0
Lucio Fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death, a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, Touch of Death starts promisingly enough, but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes.|1
As I looked at this movie once again, I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. It has the gripping ending, the deranged murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great on-location shots, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies.|1
what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr . doing in this ? light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece of rubbish , but if you think you can make me laugh do n't bother . one of the reasons i came out of my retirement to be a film agent is to help people that have no choice but to play their role . we could have been working on a movie about actors who have nothing better to do than take a vacation , but instead we were trying to get back to our old habits .|0
i ' ve felt that rupert grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him . but if you really want to put it in context , what is it about this film that gets the reader so worked up ? the movie was not even very good when it first went into production and we have to watch the entire series every day for all of 30 minutes . however , as with most hollywood films at its best there is little point in doing much to change the way the script is cast or how it should be made .|0
okay , so writer / director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to put something like this about his book into action . i think he has been very clever in writing this piece of crap , making sure that every single person in the whole movie is aware of it and not just pretending to care . you can imagine how much of a pleasure it must have been for him to pull it off at such a young age - there really was n't anything remotely enjoyable about it . i will admit that this is one of the worst movies i have seen .|0
julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of all places . when they meet in an alley that is not the most fashionable place in the world at the height of the movie it makes them both laugh . this movie is supposed to be good but it just does not have the same charm as it used to . i was thinking about getting some real tv so i could find out what happens when people get arrested . however , after watching it with my eyes closed i got bored and went to bed .|0
* some possible spoilers * of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original . the acting is pretty bad at best , even if you get a small percentage of the result . it is a great movie for the camera but so is the script . with the help of two of our producers ( one of whom i trust ) we managed to work together on several occasions . that was a big turn off and i felt sorry for her when i saw how much she seemed to care for the film .|0
I loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid, and then as I saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid, watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible.|1
I don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki...) someday will direct the REAL Neverending story.|1
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there.|1
if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or making it a little too bad . it was good , i mean , the camera really did make a funny face at the end . it even seemed like it could have turned into a real monster in there . of course i had my own version of the script that i wrote which was not very great , but pretty good . i was actually able to get the story off on film . i watched it as long as i can remember and then put it away .|0
this is absolutely the worst comedy i have ever seen . it ' s hard to explain though , because ( and this may not be particularly surprising ) it was a very good comedy . while most of the acting was simple , in the films it usually consisted of some sort of action scene where someone tries to kill someone , but he just gets his head bitten off by an ax murderer . the movie was so bad that it had a lot of plot with a certain kind of ending that made for a terrible film . there was only one other thing i thought i would enjoy watching .|0
This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway.|1
killer flood : the day the damn broke : 1 / 10 : finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof . i was about to turn the tv off when my phone rang . i did not know that this was an emergency call . it could be just a friend calling to wish me luck or a friend wanting something of mine ( although i still have trouble understanding why i would agree to meet with them at all ) but as i waited , i watched the same segment over and over . once again , for some strange reason , there was no mention of any dead people in the movie .|0
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. What?! That's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.|1
"i saw this movie with my mother , and i loved it ! it was such a sweet story , and i could hardly believe how much of an emotional man the movie had become . but as the film started to wind down , i saw the final scene between my parents . they were trying to avoid one another by going to see each other , and it was like she was reading his mind . my mother is no fool ; she knew exactly what he was thinking . after that , all i can say is , "" this is bad .

^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap. Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. No one can even cry believably.If you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.For example, I left the room for a second, while Jennie Garth's character was sleeping with her manager.|1
"I was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.Unfortunately, I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of ""twists"" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act."|1
Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being.|1
This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and I want to die' garbage. But the movies from the 80's are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!|1
i caught this on hbo under its category of ` ` guilty pleasures ' ' , and i would agree that i would like to see a few of these books . in any case , they are the very worst kind of crap . when i first started working at the library i thought it might have been really cool to sit in a cheap leather swivel chair while watching some crappy movie . well , not so bad , but i got bored quickly . my favorite genre of film was horror movies based on the premise of the movie . unfortunately , this one did not have a good plot line .|0
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.|1
this movie did n ' t do it for me , an avid snl fan for the past 14 years . jamie is a good fan , and has never shown any particular interest in his movies . he had a very nice girlfriend back in college , i think we all like to think that she can have been a real asset in getting him to do some good , but he never was able to do much of anything with her . anyway , one saturday morning , right before school starts , jamie drives out to the parking lot to get a cigarette and sees two other people .|0
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous.|1
As far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries anyone? ), this one is up there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it aims for. In recent light of events (Guantanamo) this movie is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of it's time, when it was released in the 70s! One can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): Screw the politicians and politics in general.|1
"i saw this movie yesterday , and like most allrdy wrote ` ` i also expected a steven movie ' ' , but now that i know how you were able to pull it off , i 'm not sure if i would even get to enjoy it . all of the movies are bad . there are some really awful things to see with one 's eyes closed . in fact , there are some really terrible things to see . you do not want to watch anything else on the film set for at least four hours , or worse , three weeks .

if you can stomach the campiness , this movie should make you laugh out loud several times . it did not . instead , it made me cry - a lot . when i looked around to see if anyone noticed , i was surprised to see people acting funny . they were acting funny for some reason and it made me question what the hell i was doing here . but then again , everyone else on the planet seemed to think so , so who am i kidding ? there are worse actors in this movie than the guys i went to college with !|0
` ` the king of queens , ' ' in my opinion , is a pure cbs hit ! despite the fact that he has never seen an american film and does not know where his tv sets come from . if you could only make him feel like a real producer , perhaps it would make him feel better . but most of all , i ca n't be sure whether or not there really is a movie going on . at any rate , there is no one left who understands how to play this movie . why are they playing with it ? well , let me answer that question .|0
Now first let me say I love god awful movies. Especially horror films mainly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 with no pain. But this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. Give me 3 back to back viewings of Manos The Hands of fate or Monster A-go-go over this any day. Avoid this film like the plauge!! Now excuse me while I go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth I had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film.|1
first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular . the cast is like the saved by the film crew who are trying to build an image of themselves at the end , or something . when it happens , they fail miserably . i think it will be good for everyone in the theatre if they can work together . maybe it will help them have some fun . the characters and dialogue are a mix of what could have been and what could have been . it should not be so bad ; the scenes are usually fairly predictable .|0
this movie is great . 80 ' s sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse , so they get it from the guy who plays a little boy in the bad movie . of course , these guys did have one good thing going for them . they had fun , got to know each other , knew each other , and even found time to do a little research into this movie . i actually saw the film in late 1980 . it was a really nice film and was not bad looking . at first , i believed it would go down well .|0
it seems to be a common thing in the 90 ' s to play with cliches . some manage to do so without having any sense of style . other than this movie you would think that it would be bad , but it only plays out as an example of what might actually happen . i will tell you that there is a lot of comedy involved in this movie . at the moment , there are about three dozen scenes and it 's hard to decide how many or how often . we are sitting in a large office in a very large building located on the outskirts of town .|0
my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction . i never understood why people were so hung up on this movie ; it was a shame to see it . as long as we all like this film , we can get along just fine . although there was some negative reviews , most of our viewers and fans seem to be enjoying this film . how does one tell someone about their feelings towards the movie if you love it ? everyone seems to find it amusing , yet nothing is funny or even very funny .|0

I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse.|1
a group of adventurers travel to the ' dark continent ' to try and locate a lost heiress named diana , who has been dead for about a year now . this is a complete waste of time - what were the chances of anyone being able to find her ? it would be much easier to search through all the old texts and find some references to a missing daughter or grandson . but there are a number of people with no idea what she looked like in 1931 . i think the only thing we really got out of their stories was that she had a high school degree .|0
"heh . . . i ' m surprised this movie still exists in any form , let alone it being available for rent from the film industry . "" "" my first impression was that there is not a lot of quality entertainment to be had out there in the usa today . if you have just seen enough of the early 1930s movies to know what type of films these are , your eyes were deceived . some of them are very predictable and well known , most of them are pretty funny . but they are boring . one does not want to read too much into these things ."|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake.|1
Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience.|1
i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely . the first time i saw this movie , i thought it sounded a lot more believable . i was wrong . this film is just plain terrible . if you read about these movies on wikipedia ( one of the reasons why i never looked at them ) then you would understand how awful they really are . the story is so far from any decent comedy i have ever seen , and there are no comedic moments . the script is unappealing , even though the characters are wonderful .|0
` ` tart ' ' is a good illustration of old the yogi berra saying : ` ` if you do n ' t know how much money you can spend on something like that , it would be a disgrace to you both . but in fact , i really enjoyed this last movie . all the guys were very friendly and i found myself agreeing with them . the first movie was bad , but i could feel my heart sink as it got better . it did n't take me long to start feeling sorry for myself . the second movie was not too bad either .|0
bad , bad , and did i mention bad ? aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest thing i saw on the day i had to do it was the worst movie of my life . i have never experienced a movie like that in my life . i tried to think what could be done to change the situation but unfortunately there were too many options for me to choose between watching the horror or seeing the film . however , i thought i would watch them anyway , because it seemed to be the best way to stay sane .|0
a great movie , with a rather unclear political message . its shot in a theatrical style , i . c . p . r . b. t . s . s . a. v . e . l ' s a good movie and i loved it ! i am very excited about the new book . i thought it was funny . when i came on scene i had an idea of where it could be filmed . i think it might have been directed by don ' t - go - anywhere - else but it was the first action that i ever watched .|0
hannibal must be the most god - awful movie i have seen in a long time . in fact , i want nothing better than to see the film . even if there are no other movies in it , that 's just the first one i want to see and watch . besides , the movie is so depressing , it will ruin any good quality time i have with the plot . who wants to watch an unappealing movie with no purpose other than to make fun of someone else ? you do n't even know where the guy falls off the wagon or whether he has ever been kissed by a woman before .|0
even with only 6 , 000 bucks and a cast of part - time actors , christopher nolan was a master . nolan is a movie director and works hard to write the screenplay as a prop . his work includes several films that would be great if they had been available at the start of the series . but it is just not worth taking into account all the fun and excitement i got watching this movie . there are three main characters , two girls and a boy . the first one is a cute kid who likes to shoot people on the beach .|0
one of the more prominent / popular episodes , but clearly one of the worst . a red - shirt female falls for khan , and he gets to date her . that 's enough to make any girl cry . then there are the horrible things that play out in movies . when i was ten , my dad gave me this dvd . i could n't believe i had watched it . the first night i slept alone i got really sick . i still remember the feeling of terror that i had as i lay on my bed , hoping to wake up at any time .|0
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and I've always been a fan of Foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, HATED this movie.Although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in Lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.Although the story chiefly revolves around M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.|1
"I would like to know if ""The Outsiders"" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD?There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total.The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called ""Black Forest Clinic"" which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync. I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions, thank you in advance."|1
i do n ' t know where to begin . perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen , and it was all in vain . oh well , i guess i could always get on the phone with her and tell her about it later . if she ever decides to hang up on me and listen to my side of the story , then i might as well have told her the entire story already . it seems like i have some explaining to do , too . what an odd thing to say ! i had no idea that this series was going to be short .|0
This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear?|1
i saw heaven ' s gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago . tickets were sold in advance based on the story . i thought that was quite odd . i did n't think such things were likely to be a popular movie at the time . so it is still not true . you can ' t say that they have never been made before . this film , or whatever it is , does not look anything like the movies i ' m used to watching . it appears to be an old - school movie .|0
when i saw the trailers for this movie , it looked like a good romantic comedy . i expected some funny little characters that would appear out of nowhere and ask ' are you going to go with us or just stand by ? ' but none of the acting is what i expected . there seems to be nothing funny about any of this film ! this is all such a waste of time . why do they have so many action scenes in this movie ? it seems as if most of the stunts were just not well executed at all .|0
OK, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup.|1
i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola ' s masterpiece . i was lucky enough to hear of this novel in one of the local journals for the first book . the story is funny but there is an odd quality to the plot , a strange twist . it seems that the plot revolves around all of the things that make you want to go see the dead . so far no - one has shown me any of their work since the last book came out . what makes this movie such an odd film ?|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But, I liked it. I found myself grinning through the entire movie. I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I pictured them. And the town and scenery were just right as well. I recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.|1
1st watched 7 / 29 / 2001 - 4 out of 10 ( dir - mark dindal ) : fast - paced , frantic animation effort by ted ' s friends is very satisfying for one of us . but the characters were completely unrealistic . i have to say i was a bit shocked to learn this movie might not be available on hbo . in fact , that makes it look pretty much like a play or tv series . however , there are so many people who would like to try this movie because of the way it came out and what it will take to win .|0
sadly this film lives up to about 1 % of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a good feeling . it is truly amazing , but i think you may be right about how much of an audience it has been for over 50 years . it actually looks like it could use some more work and i do not blame anyone for not liking it . i was looking forward to working with one of my old friends on this , but i had to get back to work after what i saw last saturday afternoon . there was something odd about the entire set .|0
"I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."""|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and candid performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm certain it couldn't have attained the Dante-style depths that this one did.|1
not having any idea what this film was about , but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in one of their best films . i had a bad feeling at the end of the show , but i did n't dare question it . i still do n't know how the story ended up going down the same track as before , so i let it go . i decided to take a break from my studies and take some more time to write another book . i would rather have a full - time job than sit around and watch movies like this .|0
Based on what little i have seen of this show I don't think I will ever watch it again. Its not even remotely believable and frankly the Derek character just makes me angry.Sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again? Why would i want to watch that?!? No thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though.Not to mention that I think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings.|1
I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show. And you have taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in.|1
ah ! when good actors take on bland material ! if you are thinking of this movie as a tight - lipped horror film , i assure you that it was not . the characters have been cast in different genres , none of them quite as bad as the plot and some of them certainly are very good . there is no point in saying that we are not doing anything for our characters , just that we know they would enjoy it if we do . there is nothing about this movie that is supposed to be funny . it is a total letdown .|0
"Although it isn't mentioned very often, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she's hiding something...This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about, and have sympathy for during the climax, which doesn't happen very often in horror films."|1
though i strongly feel that sitr is the best gene kelly movie , but this a pretty good one . i hope you enjoyed it and may even be happy with the reviews . thanks for taking a chance on a nice guy . if you were going to make a film , we could have been in a bad place . thank you so much for letting me stay with you as your roommate . i really hope you did not have to rent a trailer for this movie . i ca n't afford to get a trailer , and it seems like a great idea .|0
while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that , a wealthy landowner ignores ancient native american art as if it had no significance . the only thing he has done well is get rich . he was in a real bad mood today . i have never seen so much poverty on this film before . there was no way he could have picked up his camera when we were going through here . he spent more than half of it watching the movie . he made sure everyone knew how awful it was . then he did something very different .|0
i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher . in my opinion there is nothing more disgusting than watching two people who are obviously attracted to each other at the age of five get involved . i had a very interesting time at the movie theatre , but it did n't last long . as expected , it ended badly . we were on the verge of being bored out of our minds by the whole scene and i found myself beginning to wonder why the actors actually thought this was funny .|0
another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan . a pre - ' ' malcolm in the middle ' ' bryan cranston plays patrick mcgraw ' . these are all great works of fiction that would have been better if they had been published at any of the other cinematography programs i have ever heard of . as one of the writers in this film , it is his duty to put the story together well enough to save the reader 's life . but , it does n't do anything . there is nothing more terrible than not being able to finish your book and then get out of it alive .|0
"Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says ""Isn't that clever? Am I not smart? Isn't that biting social commentary?"" And,sadly, the answer is always ""Ummmm...no."" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality."|1
"Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense."|1
From the makers of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a BIG deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). A twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named Vivian is currently residing in Romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in America for being werewolves.|1
my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not Queens in NYC.Ramin Bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the OTHER face of American, but the REAL face of America.Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta' aperta.|1
i decided to watch this movie because i ' d not seen carol lombard before in any movie . i ' m not even sure whether i liked her , or if she was really that bad but i liked the idea of watching it for some reason . i found it a little funny to watch the film with a girl who could only have been 17 . i couldn ' t understand why she would give up her life for such a monster . i thought she was nice , although she never said anything about her past .|0
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan, I collect his movies and so far has get to 60. But I´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. But hey that´s why I like him - he is entertaining.But this one has to take the price, I can´t stop wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and also Corbin Bernsen to the picture.While Bernsen is plain awful (I really don´t like him), Roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn´t mean much).|1
i will commend it in only one respect . . it was innovative . innovative does n ' t mean it ' s a great film . it just has to do its part and that ' s all anyone knows . you don ' t see so many of those films at these times , either . if you don ' t like them , then you can ' t watch them . if they are bad , go back to the movies . if there is an opportunity to live up to expectations , then try to follow your own rules and find something more positive to look forward to .|0
"The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan. After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the ""key to the universe"" that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about. Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. Each has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. All of the actors give great performances."|1
"This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. ""THE HOLLOW"" is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either."|1
I love Ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. And the photography is quiet nice. We put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. When we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. About halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little.|1
"Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at ""film noir"". The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The ""non-traditional"" casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder ""what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?"" then the storyteller has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish."|1
i was lucky enough to have seen this film at it ' s seattle film fest screening , and was blown away by what i thought of as the movie ' s finest . it wasn ' t even that great . the only thing that did really make me dislike it was the fact that it was so boring . no - one ever gets to see anything like this . the whole film is nothing more than an overblown production . there is no way to actually know what the characters are about . all i know is that it ' s not very convincing .|0
"""My Blue Heaven"" is boring. The plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. The leads, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.There's really only one reason to watch ""My Blue Heaven""."|1
ok , i ' ve seen over 100 troma films , and some of them are pretty bad . ` ` sizzle ' is one of them . for example , you ' ll have to wait 6 years before you find a movie where they make a film of an alien being murdered by aliens . at least , that ' s what it looks like . in this movie the aliens are all dead - no life , no intelligence , no power , no material . they don ' t even act like aliens , they just eat each other .|0
"OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal -""no really, it's research equipment, the air holes are just an accident""). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there's something to steal."|1
"never , ever , have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of men who are at least fifty - two years apart in age . there is n't much about it that i 'm aware of , but i can tell that the overall picture was good . the story was pretty good , the characters were good and they made a great story , but the main thing for me to say about it is that it was an awesome story . i ca n't believe you did all this research and got nothing from this .

"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its ""Sita"" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men."|1
mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo - jumbo that drags on for well over two hours . the only thing that saves this film from being lost is that one of my best friends will be in it ! ' i ' d like you to hear a snippet of this story . it was edited by a man with very good taste in movies , who loves to show off his work and make himself famous . the movie does not have any particular theme . there is nothing about why they decided to get into the game , or how much of what they are told is actually real .|0
this film gives new meaning to the term ` ` uneven ' ' , giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by the reality of the story . for example , there is a huge difference between these two movies , but the original was so badly filmed and so poorly played that you can not even imagine it could have happened . the acting is completely out of character - in the worst possible way . the plot is so atrocious that you ca n't begin to understand it . it is utterly useless . the whole thing is too ridiculous , and it is all about trying to make sense of it .|0
Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can't recommend this film.The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort.|1
dr . pena ( giancarlo esposito ) , a ` ` crypto - zoologist ' ' ( fancy term for one of those self - deluded losers who do not have enough money or talent to go on any kind of movie ) was an absolute moron . he thought that all the people who could afford to live in luxury were wasting their energy . but he was wrong . it did n't even work because they never made any money ! the only reason i went to the movies at all was just to get out of them ! i like my movies very much .|0
this is another sci - fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse , the acting or the horror ? how did we get here ? well , there were some interesting scenes , but not enough for me to do much reading . it was actually more a comedy than anything else , with one notable exception : i have n't seen any of these characters in a long time . they may not have ever been actors from the movies that i have watched . i really think about writing this on my own and seeing what happens when people want to be portrayed as a great actor .|0
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey's character DIck Harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either.|1
"I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine this as even approaching ""stoner classic."" That would be like calling Singles a ""grunge film."" The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected."|1
"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that."|1
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground.|1
to make this short and sweet : i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the entire trilogy . i am disappointed that it did not give me more than an hour , let alone five minutes . the plot is not interesting in any sense except as long as you like the characters . the premise and characters of this film are just as bad as anything i have seen on dvd . i do not care what happens to the script or who made it ; i am just grateful that this movie makes me feel good . thank you for your time and understanding .|0
the first time i saw this film i was a kid . i was ten years old when it was shown on tv , and as i looked around at all the strange twists and turns of it , i realized that it was one of the oldest films ever made , and probably the most difficult to watch . i remember sitting there with my mom on a couch watching movies with my brother in the recliner . it was funny , but only for a couple of minutes . however , if you do n't believe me , look at this one .|0
"The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. She realizes that she can ""feel"" and ""see the real world""."|1
"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said ""To Be Continued"" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more."|1
i really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3 . it ' s surprising that equal opportunity is so much bigger . and who knows , it could have been an award - winning film too if it had been allowed to do the job of setting up the production in its own special way . anyway , i ' m just glad i didn ' t see this movie because the actors are not very interesting . one night , at the movies theatre , i wandered over to a table for two by the window looking out into the bright lights of downtown hollywood boulevard .|0
five fingers relies heavily on barbaric , shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie - going response . this is nothing short of ridiculous . the actors were obviously used to dealing with high drama and they did n't even notice that all the action was coming in from different directions . i do n't really care about the characters or where they came from . i just do not understand why those two men would have worked at a nightclub . when i thought of it , there was no reason why either man would ever go into a nightclub .|0
you know , before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases . i did have some sympathy from people who were involved in these murders . but it 's not the movies that are the most important thing about this movie . i loved the first episode and was impressed by the quality of the story . the plot was one of the main points that i had heard throughout the films . we were playing the same scenes over and over again ; it was just much more entertaining than the second half . this was one of the worst episodes ever .|0
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily.|1
"having enjoyed neil gaiman ' s writing ( especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in ` ` the dream hunters ' ' ) . "" and this is what i got , for being a great person who could write it well . i just wanted to see if you had the time . i can only hope you do n't have some kind of bad taste in music . i hope you do not like this song . i love this song ... but i ca n't let it continue . it is really too loud . please take your time and look at it and tell me why ."|0
at the beginning of the movie , ramgopal verma says that ` ` sarkar ' ' is his tribute to the godfather ' . in fact , it appears that he has seen it as much as any of the others ( who have ) . in this case i thought it was a good - looking movie , so i thought it might be funny to watch it with you . no , it wasn ' t funny . for all intents and purposes it didn ' t really look like a movie at all . i ' ve watched too many bad horror movies these last 20 years to count .|0
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. You must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. You must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.Firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance.|1
Buyer beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description. The movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. It looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception.|1
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!!|1
"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the ""Fat Guys At the Movies."" The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen."|1
I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit.|1
. . . and i ' m so disappointed because i ca n ' t seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere . its a good movie , but it doesn ' t even have a decent soundtrack , and i was wondering how many more times that we are going to get to see this movie . i thought it would be nice to watch some real action with an audience . the movie starts off with two people doing a lot of shopping , and then turns out to be boring . there is little to recommend it : it is just another bad movie .|0
this is one of those movies where the acting , set location , direction , and effects were so bad that it was not worth watching - although you will find it funny to witness this . i thought about the movie before we watched it , but did not recognize it at all . i guess i should be able to tell you a little bit about the characters in this book if you would like . some of the characters looked like they wanted to die but did not . most of the characters were just plain stupid , with a lot of fun .|0
story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on halloween night . in all my life i have never experienced anything like this but i am sure we can learn more later . as a young teen i had been hoping for a big magic movie or movie star or movie star , but it does not appear to be what i was expecting . there were many movies and plays that i liked , but no acting . the main reason why i was looking for something bigger was because it is one of the reasons i wanted to watch this show .|0
i ' ve been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film . it seemed dull to me , much as you might think if you were to know how the story ended . not that any of these characters are particularly funny , for most of them look like they ' d rather be eating popcorn or making a movie out of toilet paper . the main difference between this series and any of the other films is the content . what really interests me is that although there are many scenes in this film that make sense , they always seem to have the same amount of importance as those on the television shows .|0
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. They got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film... Its just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi directed this. I'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film.|1
"This movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all ""gringos"" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. All that is outside one's country's border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else."|1
I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?'|1
i loved this movie ! yes , it is rather cheap and i ' m sure plenty of reviews will be out in the big city for this . but i ' m not a fan of the characters . i do like the comedy , although it is still pretty good . if you want to see something that is hilarious , please look online . i have never seen one before . i was just wondering what it was they were using when i read about it in the paper . the story was very short and sad .|0
a young man , named danny , has run away from home and meets a drifter , named bix , who is willing to give him a place to stay and make some money in his spare time . the only problem with these stories is that most of the things they say does not make much sense . it is as if they have all been cast off a film . i do n't know why this happened . maybe they just got tired of being told what to do ? or maybe they were too afraid to take any action . there was certainly a fight going on between bix and danny .|0
"This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad ""Alien lifeforms inhabit earth"" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian ""Judgement day is at hand, seek Jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell"" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this."|1
dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . starring rudy ray moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong people and to kill , but i think we can all understand why he would get so upset about this one . i really think that the only good part of the film is the fact that the actors do n't have any idea how to go about acting . there are lots of funny things to talk about and they are pretty funny . even if you wanted to take this movie down a peg or two , it just does not make any sense .|0
well first and for most i ' d just like to say that i ' m back out of retirement from writing this book . it ' s a great comedy and has the potential to be a good movie . but there is nothing else in it that would make me want to give it a shot . if you ever felt like you had something to say , or see the film , then let ' s just say you are not looking for one . i didn ' t think it was possible for this story to be as bad as all of the other films on the shelf .|0
"This is a cult classic for sure! !It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want "" to view the world differently"" then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout."|1
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see. It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one. Even thou I'm not interested in football I wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up.|1
i saw this movie when i was very young living in houston , texas . i really enjoyed this movie and its characters . it makes me wonder if the rest of you could be so proud of the movie ! but no , it is simply not that easy to get . there are those who find themselves stuck in a foreign land for about 2 or 5 hours while watching other people ' movies . one of these persons has to stay in the united states because someone else can come and go as he pleases . they have to take their own time with their hair , dress , makeup and hair .|0
"""The Quickie"" tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and...well, frankly, this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary.Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob-guy as being from ""Pacific Exterminators"" with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say ""West Coast Exterminators"". Eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh).In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets ""live""."|1
this is a classic continuation to bleu , the likewise excellent film , with juliet binouche as a main star . you will probably want to read this part because it was written by another person , but i just thought it would be good for you . please give it a chance . it is an entertaining piece of sci - fi literature and very good acting . i really have no interest whatsoever in playing around in this kind of writing but i would also like to try some different ideas . if you like this , we can set it up at my house .|0
this is , arguably , the worst of the major ava gardner films . yes , she is gorgeous . but in the end , i see it as a huge flaw in the movie . i have seen her movies more times than you will ever think are worthy of me , but i am so not interested . how can they make an attempt to improve the story if there is no such thing ? why did hollywood do anything that would make this movie bigger and more interesting than any other ? what was the point of doing it all alone ?|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life.|1
"went with some friends and one of my friends mom , thinking it would be a good way to start a new chapter in the life of the movie . apparently not . i have no idea how she can do this kind of thing . why did n't she tell me all this before ? 
 "" oh , dear god . this is terrible ! look at all these horrible things . i hope this is n't one of those movies where you hear about people trying to die and then finding out on the news that they are stuck in there forever . what happens to those people when they come out ?"|0
whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh ' s head , which is always hidden from us because we ca n't tell the difference between any movie and a movie . that does n't stop us from waiting and listening to an old horror film for almost an hour with no results until i was ready for it all to be over . it was hard not to laugh while watching it , but i had to find something else to occupy my time . eventually i made my way back to the kitchen and spent another hour watching every movie on the shelf .|0
"I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this ""film"". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing its ""praises"". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them."|1
this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite , which i try to catch on tv every year if i can . i do n't know what the other guys are thinking about as they watch it , but i hope it will be good . i have never watched that show before ; it was one of my very favorites . it reminds me of the first episode where it came out and some of the viewers had a few questions asked by the producer . so i decided to look at it anyway . while waiting for the director to finish speaking , i just sat in the chair and let him talk .|0
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh.|1
like a lot of films from the early sounds days , cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than in actual real life . it does seem odd that she is able to do this while watching the same movies . i will let you in on one of her favorite movie reviews , but please do not take any offense . i just did not feel like sharing my story with anyone . i am sure that you are thinking that i am a bit nuts about all of this so why waste time talking about it and wasting my time if there are n't any other things we can do ?|0
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired.I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.Well done Alex Frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing.|1
one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films , ` ` scooby doo and the loch ness monster ' ' turns out to be a very funny movie that gets really interesting as it plays out its life . in fact , you will not even see the movie , but you will see what is inside . the film is so ridiculous that you can almost believe that i am standing next to this man and watching a scene in which everyone else is making out and playing with each other . we have been watching this movie for a while now and it looks pretty scary .|0

"Where do we start with an offering like this? I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms ""League of Extraordinary Twaddle""."|1

"wrestlemania 6 , is an entertaining wrestlemania , if not an entirely successful one . the ultimate challenge , is to be able to pick it up and read what is written in its pages . at the top of the list i have a note to take to the director that makes him so angry with us . he demands that this production be played on a bigger scale , rather than let people see it as a "" b "" / or b - movie . his only reason for letting us watch this is to make sure we get a little bit of satisfaction out of showing how well our characters are doing ."|0
jewel thief is * the * crime thriller of bollywood , and why should it not be ? it is a dirty job to try and get by . it is a lot of fun , but it does not make for the most compelling story ever made . i wish i could say with my usual confidence that you will like this book , but there is no way . i have read the first two scenes and had absolutely zero luck at all in making this one . the first one is a huge disappointment . it was an amazingly boring film , even though the script is very nice .|0
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. It was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. Running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), No close-ups!!|1
i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites . . . it has all the drama and suspense of the kind of comedy that only a child would get to watch . the characters are such a bunch of pricks ! there was nothing remotely funny about them . they were very , very dumb . what you might expect from someone who likes horror movies so much , but is in no way funny . . . actually it was pretty hilarious as far as i could tell . this is not the first movie i saw where the director gets shot down .|0
"For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, right then we learn (SPOILERS...if they can be called that) that the Devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! ""Prosatanos"" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for ""human greed"" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris!"|1
my friends and i have watched this so many time i have lost count . this is worth seeing for myself how bad things are in the 21st century . you can not imagine what a hard life this would be to live , even with some money . if it were fair there would n't be much to watch on tv except the one - of - a - kind documentarian who spends his days making sure that the country is as clean as possible without any oil damage . the world does not seem to understand what the problem is with the world at heart .|0
"I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with the gratuitous sex although I admit the rotational style of bonking was something I had not seen (nor experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The ""Oakville Tribune"" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario???)"|1
it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski ' s trilogy , it seems obvious to me . in fact , it might even be the first film i ever heard of . this book is very good , and i do not want to admit that i was disappointed with how it ended . however , after reading a few pages of kieslowski ' s series , i felt sorry for the fans . they loved his films and were excited about seeing the movies . he was such a great kid , but he had no idea what he wanted to become when he grew up .|0
Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology.|1
barbara payton is the suppose - to - be sultry sexy young hot chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley valley ? and then there 's this . that was pretty much the last item on her to - do list at the very end of the line . i got to thinking that maybe this was some sort of romantic joke , just like everything else , but i had been hoping for a good laugh . so i did my best to look genuinely sympathetic when i made this suggestion to miss kearney .|0
A real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for TV movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. Stacey Keach is too soppy as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies TV spin off, of Planet Of The Apes.|1
Okay, When I bought this flick I though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the Earth and starts right away to kill people! Well, It was almost everything what I expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. Acting has to be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? Reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring.|1
as an ancient movie fan , i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the worst books ever written . this film would have seemed like a very easy - to - read story had you not witnessed it . the only thing surprising was the amount of material that the actors and directors were able to print in its entirety . there was nothing funny about this movie ; most of the acting was totally stupid . for the most part , this film came off well , although i saw some errors here and there on the way out .|0
"two years after this movie was made , ` ` the juror ' ' came out . do n ' t waste your time and money by pretending you can be a witness to something i had nothing to do with . in fact , it was just too easy to dismiss that little episode . but then again , what could i possibly say ?

"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back.

the love letter ( 1999 ) : starring kate capshaw , tom everett scott , tom selleck , ellen de vil ( 1965 ) and james mcguire ( 1962 ) . a lot of things have happened since this movie was released , some good , some bad , and some really bad . at least that 's how it is with me . if you ever read this story , you should be aware that there are no happy endings to this movie . as far as i can tell , it does not make much sense . well , i do n't know exactly what i am seeing .|0
"a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel ` ` waltz into darkness ' ' of the writer cornell ' . but for the first time i had to think about what this book would have been if i had seen it in person . "" when i looked over , i saw that they were having a little more success than i thought . and then i remembered why i had come here in the first place . i was looking at this movie in the second set and now i was looking at these two people who are trying to get back into some kind of normal life together ."|0
reanhauer ( bill roy ) is the leader of a desert - dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people and create a world that was never even a real city . i can understand why someone would think that this place might be a bad idea for filming such an insane scene . but if you have some kind of sense of humor , just do n't expect anything other than a movie in which you 're not allowed to watch it . they will only try to make their stories sound like a joke by acting as if they are talking about the weather or something remotely interesting .|0
From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again. This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema.The story is needlessly told in flashback style. All of the 'present' sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. I never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.The story self also isn't exactly the greatest. It isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell.|1
made with film stock left over from the production of nana , 1927 ' s sur un air de charleston is the most incredible film ever seen in the history of hollywood . its premise is absolutely perfect . it was filmed on a thursday night and i saw her as she sat in the dark with her head down , crying . i remember being confused at what she was doing . i just did n't think she would be crying . i wanted to go out and get her some flowers or something , but i did not want to wake her . so i stayed close to the door and waited .|0
I mean really, really, REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean regular high, i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies).|1

25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have been a fan of his since the 1950's. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me quite a bit. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery.|1
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it! Its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name, but once viewing it...will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside. Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made. However, being unique as it is.|1
1 ) bad acting . 2 ) for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet , it sure looked like home to one . 2 ) they all seemed so nice when they were in the movies ( which did n't seem fair because most of them were from mars ) . there was something about this movie : the plot was terrible . i could see why people would want to have a laugh at the poor actors who just ended up running away and leaving the stage . the whole scene looks like it should have been on a bad cop show .|0
this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps . i think the plot is pretty lame . the first story is when the guy goes on an expedition to a cave that he claims has a secret meeting with a mysterious demon from hell and finds his wife killed by some man who does not know anything about her existence . it 's a little like seeing a ghost for the first time - you ca n't quite figure out why someone might want to kill your friend , so you try to see if you can solve this mystery .|0
Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.|1
"I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. There was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original ""Lone ranger"", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing at children's hospitals as the Lone ranger for sick kids.) To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger."|1
my wife and i could n ' t even finish the film . truly , it was rather painful . first , the historical characters in the film are all a mess . of course , if you do n't know what it is about , you would think they were trying to create something really sad . but with most movies there is only so much a person can take . no amount of narration could explain how the whole experience ended up in this one movie . this film started as a good way to get into high school history class ; then things took a turn for the worse after a few weeks .|0
a woman in love with her husband ( he ' s suicidal ) decides to have a baby to save his job . then the next day they decide to go out on their honeymoon , and this is the first time i was ever told that the people that made the movie are dead . now , as you may imagine , this series is really hard to watch . but it has its good points . there are some nice things about all of this . well , most of them anyways . the fact that they didn ' t kill anyone seems to suggest that these people were not killed by accident .|0
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say awful? The script was so weak, using cliche after cliche. It seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on Enron. Watching the movie, we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book this bad? I don't know what to say. Just terrible.|1
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie.|1
I have always liked the Carry On films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. Basically, many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g.|1
"now , i like the bollywood films and i ' m very glad they have recently gained success in the uk and i know that this film has been a disappointment to me , even though i had no idea why it was worth watching .

when this show began it was fairly interesting : we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go on about in their film . the whole story is very vague ; i get a bit confused whenever i try to fill in some of the blanks . but if i am not supposed to take this film seriously it is pretty bad , so that is ok . and the plot is rather horrible . the guy is actually a nice guy , and he pretends to be married to someone who has cheated on him and his wife .|0
I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD, particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, particularly at the finale.I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is just so so lame compared with the original. What where they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the finale?|1
rock star is a well - told hollywood - style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halford in the 1970 's . we could n't even take him out of the film for a good reason . this was one of the worst comedies that i have ever witnessed in my short career . there are many reasons why i had not listened to the reviews . first of all , did it really have to be this way ? this movie is great ! i can not wait to see what you guys think of this movie from now on .|0
I loved this movie! Yes, it is rather cheap and I'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it.|1
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons.Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson.Acting wise everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller.|1
this morning , i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed . i found myself thinking , ` ` oh , well , maybe this is a bad thing ' . i was also thinking it was a really dumb movie , but i was wrong . this movie does n't matter anymore . as the film progresses , i become even more frustrated . the plot is such a boring bunch of characters and their jokes are funny . every now and again , one of them gets lucky and saves someone . i have heard that some people get lucky when they get lucky in their movies .|0
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. We're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.The budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.This film was just so bad. There is nothing in the film even worth watching. The very fact I watched this all the way through stunned me.|1
well , sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea , and despite the mostly negative responses of many critics , i just could n't figure out why it seemed so easy for you to get on the movie ' s stage and make your way there . but this film was obviously not going anywhere because it was a waste of credits . the only logical conclusion to this production was that the cast did not really know what they were doing or even care about anything . the story was basically an overblown attempt to keep the director happy , but the actual characters had no experience with any of the other actors .|0
as far as fake documentaries go ( fakumentaries anyone ? ) , this one is up there with the best of them . if you want it made into something else , you can get it to be an original : a book by someone with whom you share a great story . if you want to know who or how many actors are at this film and how they act , it will have to be somebody from the real world who has worked on this movie . i ca n't imagine why people would love to do so much for a movie but i guess their passion does make them very popular .|0
I logged on here right after watching this movie, feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. And so, since I want the job done right...From the opening shot, the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard.|1
if you thought nbc ' s 10 . 5 was stupid , you ' ll be happy to hear that fx reached into the air at 4 in the morning . it is not really a horror movie by any stretch of the imagination - it was more like a comedy flick with a bad ending and there were no comedies . i suppose the main characters are just plain boring when they play this kind of game but the plot is fun and well executed . however , every now and again , one little bit of action can end up leaving me feeling sorry for the actors .|0
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. I realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. Beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart rack...You know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget.|1
I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino.|1
this is the worst movie i have ever seen . if i was n ' t watching it for free , i 'd have bought it in a second . that 's just how boring it was . there are no action scenes . all you see is a bunch of old people at the theatre and more than two hundred kids who ca n't even remember their names . the last thing we expect to hear from any of them is an opening play with a plot that would be entertaining if it was based on reality tv . what happened to the little guy with the big ears ?|0

naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 ( may be overall too ) if it were a movie i would have been more than happy to get back into my groove because of how much fun this is , especially after what i 've just seen in the middle east . still , i 'd rather stay in my funk for another couple hours until i can find some relief from this horrible place . i do not know how i feel about that film . i do not know why i am so depressed .|0
Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! !Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know?|1
is there a fire fighter cliche that is not used in this film ? from the opening line ` ` i ' it was an interesting portrayal , although it certainly did not provide one . as far as the actors were concerned , there was absolutely no point in doing such a production because they could never make it without the help and encouragement of a movie like this . all of the scenes played out exactly as they were meant to with great flair , but at the same time they ended up sounding too much like a comedy . i have to admit , i am disappointed in this film .|0
"my girlfriend , as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square , after the movie , says , "" why did n't you call me ?

I loved this film, Independent film-making at its best. The cinematography , pacing, rhythm , and acting were perfectly in sync. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. And that is just what they did!|1
i heard that after the first oceans movie , the sequels begin to go downhill . i believe that this movie was meant to be a film about the future of the city of rome . there is something about the history of rome that gets under my skin . i would never have thought that one day we would get to see it again so many years later . but look at us . what can we say ? here is how the movie began . i remember when i was twelve and i had just gotten out of the sixth grade and my father was having a serious talk with his manager .|0
"Two little girls strike a friendship. One tries to convince the other she's a witch. The other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. On and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose ""shocking"" questions. You know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, ""How do you make a deal with the devil""? Oooh... creepy.In the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend."|1
This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist.|1
"Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in ""Demons"" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by ""The Smiths"" and ""The Cult"", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing."|1
i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well . compared to this film , the film looks like something out of a hollywood horror flick . it reminds me so much of that movie , and not in a good way . i can tell that you 're feeling some tension , but you 've got to let those feelings go . the actors are very bad actors , and the acting is pretty awful . they just do not have any guts . i know that these movies were probably written by someone who was trying to make a living at it , but they were really lousy .|0
"i went to see this movie to kill some time . i remember cole hauser in ` ` tigerland ' ' , "" she continued .

This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid.|1
there are a whole lot of movies , primarily from the 80s , that are so terrible that you ca n't wait to watch one of them . most of the best comedies i have ever seen come on dvd were horror films with an awful soundtrack . the only good film i have seen in a while was one of the greatest ones of my time . unfortunately , this movie was not as good as these other ones . however , it had the best plot and the most interesting character development . i would love to talk with you later but i really need to get going .|0
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder. Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime.Sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late.|1
"First of all, i have nothing against Christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. I don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this ""movie"", because I couldn't find any of those in this. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some sake has abandoned religion."|1
i ' m not surprised that this film did well at the hamptons film festival . it is a shallow film , which is actually quite amusing . there are very few people who could do so much good with their lives and no one has the balls to say anything funny about them . for some reason , the film was used as propaganda for the war effort . it just does n't make sense . but if you are a journalist , you will see the first few lines and read what they say before you turn the page .|0
"From the crash of the opening theme, ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" is classic 1950's entertainment. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood, where the old scumbags still lurk. This is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and almost steal the show."|1
"some movies you watch and you say , ` ` well , that made no sense . ' ' and you do not have a good story for me to read . ' "" this one is pretty bad . i had a bunch of kids in this film who were very brave . but when the director called them back into the theater and started talking about how people on tv are being taken advantage of by aliens , i was surprised . so i decided to watch it anyway . i did not enjoy watching the movie because i am just a kid who has n't seen an alien movie since he grew up ."|0
far from combining the best bits of pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them . whilst shamelessly copying the film , it is not as if they can do anything about any of it . they were all too busy getting ready for the school play to read the whole thing in their own time . i would have felt bad about leaving my mum with a load of work , but it was probably worth it . it was also kind of like having an uncle who only wants you to know he loved you very much and would kill anyone who tried to take advantage of him .|0
never having read or seen the bard ' s original work , i ca n ' t begin to compare this work to any of the other works he has ever produced . i do not think that many of the people he has worked on have read his work , but i can always say that i saw some of them who actually liked it . the book was really nice and very educational , in a way that makes you feel like you are going to meet a famous painter . however , for some reason i did not see him writing anything good .|0
Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance.The film begins with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism.|1
* * spoiler * it gives away the very irrelevant ending * * at the beginning of this movie , i had a bad day . the problem was that the script and the characters were not on the same page - they were in so much different places . i decided to write a story for an indie film . it sounds like a big mistake , but what else could i have done ? nothing ! i just had to make one more story . after a week of editing and editing , my first story is ready to be written . there is a good reason for this .|0
watching this odd little adventure movie , it ' s hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who just murdered your husband ! ! he ' s probably on some sort of drugs . maybe i can ' t understand his mind . in fact , my opinion is that we are doomed to spend a lifetime surrounded by psychos and psychos who have no idea how to make fun of them for what they look like . one of those things should be done so that you can at least feel proud of yourselves . however , if you think about it , you don ' t know much about these people .|0
This is a decent movie. Although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. It is not typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. I would recommend this movie.|1
having seen only once and in the dawn hours , i ca n ' t seem to forget this haunting film . although it is not that bad , it ai n't exactly a very good film either . if there is any point to this film , we can all agree it should be treated more like a horror flick than a comedy . when i first saw this , i wanted to turn into an actor or even a movie director , but my parents told me i did not want to waste my time . this film was one of the greatest films i have ever seen .|0
yet another in the long line of ` ` do n ' t ' ' films of the late 70 ' s and early 80 ' s , as if we were going to see anything of it . this movie is about a girl who has been sent away to stay with her grandparents for several months while they are out of town . the girl seems like she was abducted by a bunch of criminals or some such stuff . the only explanation i have for why she ended up in a prison is that her parents had some bad connections , or maybe the worst money could buy .|0
i logged on here right after watching this movie , feeling that it was so awful that at least its ending was a good one . in some way , it makes my heart break to find that while it was n't the best film i watched , i also felt sorry for the characters involved . they were just horrible . and when they are done , it is just as sad as the movie itself . i will admit that i do have a bit of a weakness for bad action movies . let 's say i was watching this movie with an old geezer who seemed to have lost his mind .|0
just awful . it ' s almost unbelievable that , with characters and situations provided by dashiell hammett , such a horrible tragedy can happen to the best of mankind . but the most amazing thing about this is how fast it happens . at the beginning of the movie - which i love more than any movie in history ever did - there is a lot of screaming and gnashing of teeth , then an explosion of action , then someone throws a brick or two against the back door and we are forced to retreat down the hallway .|0
the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film , only adds to the intensity of the films . when they are edited i like to give you a good reading about the characters and the dialogue so i can make sure that all is well . while i hate watching a movie like this it is almost funny to watch it with the person who has chosen to put it into the dvd . i know there is more to this movie but if you had seen it on tv or read about some of the real movies then you would be too shocked to say much .|0
give director stanley tong of jackie chan ' s super cop and rumble in the bronx , and what do you find out . it turns out that they are a bit more successful in the world of serial killers than any movie i could even imagine . if you love crime novels , you want to watch this little sci - fi series . well , this one is n't really a sci - fi flick . it ' s mainly some kind of comedy , which is funny , yet not very funny . on the bright side , most of the movies are pretty much predictable .|0
I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc, These movies constitute my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but whoever I was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. I don't think words could express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney brought.|1
"I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these ""professionals"" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be."|1
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish.|1
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other?Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.It's funny reading comments here about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a heel.|1
"I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. Had it been labelled an ""artsy film"" I wouldn't have purchased the DVD; now I have a DVD that I'll never watch again and who would buy it?"|1
when watching this movie , with it ' s deterministic cause and effect , wall - to - wall cliches and hackneyed sentiment , can make you realise that you ' ll be living in a new york town for a very short time if you ' re lucky . this is the same kind of hollywood horror movie i was watching before i became a performer at the theater . this is where the characters go from bad to worse , not really sure what they don ' t know . this film has had quite an impact on both sides of the world , including my own parents .|0
"I will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. Even at the young age I remember thinking, ""This is a Baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. The girls in bathing suits."" Nonetheless I was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! As a thirteen year old I never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously."|1
"The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: Good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! If you were expecting a major Hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and MPAA tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.However, if you are a fan of the old ""B"" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!"|1
"Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! I was appalled. Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his ""thumbs up"" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.What a pity. Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program."|1
As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome?|1
"I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are not any movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said ""stupid"". I applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one."|1
mishima is one of the greatest films ever made . now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of any of them , that 's why they write so much for this movie . it also seems to have a lot of subplot elements . most of the reviews were negative , as you know , but these critics are very good about what they make of their films . if you look back , you will find out that even though this film was written before 1911 , it was originally released in 1812 , and then filmed in 1953 . we have a whole lot of great movies here .|0
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me , and i could n ' t put it down until the end . there was this one guy who just seemed to know all about me , and he had this story of how he had known my parents were gay , but they never told him anything about their affair . no one knew why they were in love , except for some old friends who were really into that film , so i guess they tried to warn people away from it . it 's pretty stupid though , and it only made me want to watch it more .|0
to think this film was made the year i was born . to think people are still having their constitutional rights , no matter what it takes in the big scheme . i do love this film , with its twists and turns - and a whole lot of ' good ' that happens when you go on a road trip . there are moments like this when i can just wish i had n't left the city at such an early age . but there is something so special about watching your own life flash by ; if you really want to be seen then you must see some of it .|0
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy.They're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex.|1
it looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film ! but do not be so hard on me for i have been doing this film for over a decade . after some reviews i decided that this movie should be a huge help to us in our future career paths . let us see how many people can say ' hi ' to one of our films and then start making fun of us ? this is very much like watching the first three movies with their own set of bad acting , bad plot , bad acting and bad acting .|0
i ' ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80 ' s when i was a junior , but this film is so bad you can never tell . i do love this movie ( it ' s awful ) , but i really wanted to watch this one . if the story of how my parents were raised by their own parents is about as boring as this one is going to get , there is absolutely no way i could see how they ever found each other after being raised by their own parents .|0
"I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It is a great story and told extremely well. I fell absolutely in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""? (money). That was classic. ; )."|1
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured.|1
"i ' m not sure where to start with this . in short , it was a disappointing movie . having read the film , i decided to try my best to make some small talk . 
 "" what 's your idea of a good time ? "" i tried to find out who had won the title . it was probably just a bunch of children playing a video game or watching a cartoon . at this point , i really wanted to know how this movie ended . the acting was great , but the plot was somewhat off . the script did not speak of anything that was familiar to me ."|0
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. A couple exchanging nods over their ""good grub."" A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline)."|1
love the tpb ' s but this was a lame episode . did n ' t have the same feel that the series had and i watched it anyway . in fact , i would say that they really were an odd lot to watch at the time . if you like p ; 1 or l , just keep reading until you see a whole series of them on the way back . i think they are very funny characters , but do n't try to get your hands on any parts of them . once you begin reading all the titles , you will be shocked how bad they are .|0
"I'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new ""Doctor who"" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or BBC America; from season one we are introduce to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled last name sorry)."|1
during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it . something like : ` ` this was one of the best comedies i ever saw in my life , but now it is just bad . ' there were two things i hated about this movie ( the first was that it was such a stupid show ) . first off , it seemed like the whole episode should be shown to its viewers instead of playing some cheesy romantic comedy where the characters act like they are going to attack someone or else get murdered by aliens .|0
started watching this but did n ' t believe in any of the characters . in particular the relationship between the bakery and my own job is that i could not figure it out . the fact that the shop was on tv and there were some movies on it does not prove anything . it was a lot of fun to watch because it made me feel at home , so i figured i would just get a new camera and do something with it for the rest of the evening . as soon as i got home , i called my mom and told her what had happened .|0
This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Alice, a small town Massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami. After her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happen to be traveling to Florida..|1
There's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts.|1
this movie is truly unbelievable , in every sense of the word . i could n ' t believe what i was seeing . the movie was made to portray a boy that had fallen out of love with his mother and she found out he was her daughter . there was nothing romantic about it but for the part where the two young people fall in love , it is extremely entertaining . the story is very old school and quite predictable . after the third episode of the film , don ' t give me a break , because i am just sitting at home trying not to cry .|0
` ` mr . bug goes to town ' ' was the last major achievement the fleischer studios produced . the quality of the work was abysmal - and not only because it was a waste of film , it was cheap and cheap for my own money . i found it an even worse job in the industry . there were more people who had made this film than those who had done it , and most of them were completely lacking in creativity or skill . i have never felt so alone . if i ever go on a tour with this movie , i will never leave out the important parts .|0
"This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see ""Free Enterprise"" instead."|1
i have only seen this movie once , when i was about 14 years old , but i was thrilled that it had finally gone to dvd . however , the last episode was so awful that i was afraid to even watch it . what a total disappointment . on the screen was a man trying to kill a woman in an underground bunker where there is no way he could ever escape his imprisonment . all i got was the worst scene of my entire film . i felt sorry for the poor person that was locked up inside and would have been unable to sleep at all .|0
` ` go fish ' ' garnered rose troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise . its then , and only this is an interesting premise but lacking in detail as to how it was created . i am very sorry to say that it will remain so until a sequel comes along . after several years , i will no longer write this movie and i have already sold over $ 5 , 000 credits . i hope you will accept my invitation for a drink while i try to figure out what to do with the next few months .|0
"I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but ""The Possession of Nurse Sherri"" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like ""Horror of the Blood Monsters"" and ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch ""Nurse Sherri""? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from ""The Exorcist"", ""Ruby"", and ""Carrie"" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies."|1
I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank's Place.|1
this was pretty bad - from bad acting , bad technical details , bad camera shots , and bad audio . you could have had a whole bunch of bad actors on their stage . the only one that did n't appear to be very good in the film was john travolta , and i really hated the guy for that . my father says he does n't like him at all , but it sure would be nice to have someone who is a little more interesting than he is . anyway , as we walked back down to the car , i noticed a lot of ' 80s stuff being passed out around us .|0
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). Young Billy, Elizabeth, and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. But they can't go on fooling everyone.|1
i ' m almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice . the problems with the production are almost too numerous for me to comprehend . perhaps it was because i had been so excited about learning more about what was happening in this world that i chose to focus my attention on the actual filming of a movie , which was supposed to be a work of fiction and is actually pretty good . i got the sense that it wasn ' t based on reality , instead it was based mainly on how many scenes were portrayed in both films .|0
i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment . i watched this not expecting too much from this film . the movie was well done in a way i never expected . there were very few scenes that you can actually figure out , but some of them took me aback . what the heck is that all about ? i thought the plot was pretty simple . if i had read the book i probably would n't have paid so much attention to any of the details . it has a lot of technical detail , such as turning one of the actors into an actor .|0
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions.|1
this movie was so frustrating . everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time . i just knew this movie would n't be as good as the one i had watched with my family . if it ever got out that i was having a relationship with them , they would probably get an award for their performance . i was ready to give up on this movie and move on . i never wanted to watch this movie at all in the first place . it was just too awful . there were so many terrible scenes of death and violence .|0
if there ' s anything worse than this movie i do n ' t want to see it . i remember so many other movies in college but none of the scenes are as bad as this one , at least they ' re the worst . i just don ' t know how to make them better . the first book was a classic horror thriller about three men who were hired to kill someone and steal all their worldly possessions . the second story was much worse : a film about a woman who finds herself caught in an accident while making a trip to las vegas for a weekend vacation .|0
i loved this show . i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this one . it was kind of sad though because at the end of the film there are only a handful of songs that you can watch , which do n't take up your time . the main character is a young man in his late teens who has been arrested for sexual molestation and is being led around like a pincushion . he goes through the entire scene again , then tries to get away and runs into a rock wall . he looks like he should have died in the movie .|0
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable.|1
yes , thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie . the acting is below - average and the special effects are mediocre . however , the characters were quite good , and i really like this one . when i heard of this story , i thought that this film would be a cinematography based on the first few chapters . so i bought it . i was expecting to have to pay $ 2 , 500 to see this movie , but then my eyes wandered over to some other people in the movie and i saw they were very talented .|0
a great performance by emily grace ! i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious to see what happened to it . when i saw the movie i decided to buy it and watched it for about 25 minutes . it seemed to have a ton of interesting things to tell , so i took a peek at the screen and got excited to find myself in the midst of the most amazing film ever written . it was an all - time standalone movie with just the right amount of dialogue and structure . but unfortunately it was also completely lacking in substance .|0
this movie was never intended as a big - budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could have made . i actually had to watch it several times just to make it go away ! it was a lot of fun and the plot was interesting ; however , i really enjoyed most of the scenes and found myself wanting to get out from underneath the covers and run for the hills . the only thing that kept going through my head in the whole episode was the way we all felt on the screen .|0
"the sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so i went to the movies , and my favorite movie was "" love story "" . this made me really sad because that was a good movie , and i never heard of it . why would she choose such a bad film ? i asked her once , and she did not like it , so i got angry about it and turned off the television . in this movie , the narrator goes on and on about the woman he is going to marry . it is horrible , even though i thought it should be funny ."|0
i ' m not a big musical fan , but this is one of the few i really love . unlike the old musicals , this time i do n't want to give it too much thought . all of my friends ( and i ) are great characters . they all have good stories and some are funny . you know what ? they can still sing . i had fun listening to them because i was so close to them before they went off on a tangent . in other words , i wanted to listen to them play for a living instead of having to listen to people who would talk about movies and tv .|0
six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses . the first three were not even remotely good . the last one was quite bad . there is a guy that gets in bed with his girlfriend , has an affair and spends the rest of his life in prison . the other two were fairly good . when they saw this film they had no idea that it was just a waste of space . they got their kicks out of making it all the way through the credits . the main thing that really got them down was knowing that the sequel would be something else entirely .|0
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. It started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. As they found dead bodies, or should I say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? At times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert.|1
i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival ( world premiere ) . a haunting , intimate portrait of one of the most beautiful young girls i had ever seen . i wanted to get into that film and find out what the hell is going on behind the scenes . i have found out quite a little bit of what i thought was true . for instance , the movie has an old man , who does n't want to tell us much about his life when he speaks . the director knows there are a few important people in this film , so he tells it like it is .|0
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/."|1
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old. I had half-day kindergarten and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. I, of course, stopped watching when I got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no VCR's or DVR's back then).|1
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! It was showing on a Sky channel over here called ""Zone Horror"" which basically shows crappy B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. Apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was OK, LOL!!! In all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors."|1
This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time.|1
I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I couldn't say it better. The worst movie I've ever seen... and I've seen lots of crap! When I read you comment I thought only about the thoughts I had while watching the movie. When I saw who was one of the script writers I understood it. Balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. And his scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young Americans coming on vacations.|1
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best. I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie.|1
2005 was one of the best year for movies. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence.....Coming up we also got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong....But if this year the only great movie that came out was Everything Is Illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. The first movie as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles.|1
I've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we just don't need.Rating is a 2 as I wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Dull script matched by even duller acting. I've heard Billie Piper is OK in Dr Who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance!Please don't let this put you off Austen or historical dramas.|1
superhero movie ( 2008 ) is the most recent in the long line over ` ` parody ' ' movie movies which are so bizarre . it is a very large production that takes up only about half of the film . the plot , characters , culture and genre are completely predictable to such a large extent i feel it best to stay with the original story . i have not heard of this film before but believe me when i say that if it ever comes out my head will never recover . however , i am happy to see that one day this may come back to bite you in the butt .|0
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who dally with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually come up short. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.|1
this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it ' s not difficult to see why . there are some very nice lines about the people who do n't like the movie . there is one question in the end that seems to have an angle that is more entertaining than the rest . why did the director write this story ? what else was she doing on this movie ? all we know about this movie is that it can make anyone laugh . so , i will tell you a secret . there is nothing funny about this film .|0
"For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. This is a disjointed ""Cliff Notes"" version of Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching.Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book? The one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench."|1
this movie was terrible . you could n ' t fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie when the movie starts . i have a strong opinion that the actors are pretty dumb . it might be possible to do something like that after seeing the movie for a while , but there is no way i would ever try . the entire experience is just too horrible . why did n't we go to the film with some other characters ? maybe it would have helped us all to have some fun on an otherwise dull night .|0
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play.|1
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie. However, not more than 5 minutes later, I was already gouging my eyes out. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. The one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. However, I didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I guess anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie?|1
Having watched this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for Goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. While I do understand that Mr. Forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, I was left feeling that there was just so much of Goya left out, so much of his humanity.|1
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes.|1
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. The father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama.|1
have seen this movie today . very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist . the story has gone on for almost a year , but not so much as one - sided or half - sided plot twists . there are lots of good points to be drawn out , including the two characters that were portrayed at the end . i wanted to get something off my chest , but decided to say nothing until after the film was done . i also thought i had a right to ask him questions , like why he came back to his house .|0
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black.|1
rachel and chuck yoman ( valerie harper , gerald mcraney ) , decided the city is too busy and dangerous to risk having someone who looks a lot like don ghanes try to run off for a night or two . they had set up a party for one of the other local teenagers in their hotel room but i 'm afraid there 's no point in trying to do anything that will get them back in . it just seems like the most likely scenario would be a couple of kids sneaking down the street doing something so stupid . i was n't really looking at what happened after they left , i was just watching .|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy.|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky.|1
i do n ' t understand why this movie was released , it looked like something that you show your mates after they go off to college but what do you make of it ? are we all in love with the same actors , or are we just seeing the same movie ? did we ever see the same film as others , and there was no reason for me to think that a movie made on the bus would have been good enough . then again , if i had spent time watching it at the local cinema instead of at home i would be a lot more likely to put my hand over my mouth .|0
this film is bad . not so bad it is good . just bad . it is however hilariously bad that the director is to be found here , i would n't have thought they got off to a crappy start at all ! how could people like this movie be good enough for someone like me ? what is the premise of this film ? what is the premise of this movie ? where did we find this movie ? when did it get out ? where are we going to find this movie in this film and what will it do with it ?|0
gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure / sex movie . she wears her hair in a buzz cut and goes to dinner with some of the best friends i ever knew , but is constantly on the verge of losing her mind by the end . if you 've never seen a film that shows people getting along with each other without having an actual love affair , how do you understand so much about it ? it 's like she has no idea what it really means to be gay , or what it actually means .|0
saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons , i had hoped that the sequel would go much smoother . there were some really bad moments but no worse than these . the most depressing thing was how the movie seemed to come out without any help at all . i do not particularly like the second part of the book and i am quite disappointed in the third half of the series . however , i still think the story will be good for you . it is pretty awful . i just hope you can keep your word and put it into writing .|0
"I think ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most overrated horror film out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well-directed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like ""Gone With the Wind""!I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby Andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is)."|1
"I caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.There are situations that are left for your interpretation to ""find out"" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.The technical aspects are very good."|1
i made a promise that if ever i posted a comment that was less than complimentary , then later felt compelled to edit it so that it will not hurt anyone else . this film is the worst thing that has ever happened to this movie in my life . there is no way that this is going to make up for any of the bad things that have happened here . but i do not want you to be disappointed , and i can tell from your eyes that you are trying hard to hide what you really want to say when you hear about this story .|0
this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen . it just was n ' t funny . my wife has not yet been released and she is in a lot of trouble with the law , which makes me feel bad for the fans who have lost their way to see what she is made of . there are many good ones that i have seen over the course of my career , such as this one , but i do n't really enjoy them very much . well , some of them were hilarious , but i never saw a film that could be construed as funny .|0
as if the world needed another seagal movie . add a bunch of actors who , well . . . are not very bright . but that was all they could get from the film . so maybe you might want to keep an eye out and see if they have any news about this . i do n't know if it really makes much sense . in some ways it feels like it should be easy . after all , how else could there have been a whole group of them here in the first place and they could have just been passing through on their way to the grocery store .|0
this particular film was one that i wanted to see in theaters , but never got around to it . a good movie can just get dull and the actors are not very interesting to watch . then , on top of all the other things that had gone down in hollywood , i did n't get to see the story from the start . at first i would think there were strange characters ( who lived in the movies ) , but as they became more obvious i saw nothing odd in them . then i realized what kind of people they have to be to work with such a great film production company .|0
This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés.|1
"Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this ""world premiere."" What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production."|1
the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old . i remember loving it and being impressed that they were able to find such a great movie . it started out just like we had in the original , but it played out far worse . it was full of horror scenes , which i did not understand , but i liked the show , so i watched it from my place on the floor . i really enjoyed it . there was a girl named laura who came over one night and talked about how awful she felt for her brother .|0
an under - appreciated , unseen gem . estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant , heartbreaking fashion , the way we can all get along so well as a group . if one person wants to keep this up , just give him a call . it 's not like he even knows that i am a woman . his wife was very attractive , but they are not married and there is nothing sexual in the way she looks at him . for instance , when she says that she ' s not interested in what he has to offer , she really is looking forward to seeing the big screen .|0
I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there's also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert!|1
This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget film) is much better . I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film. THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing.|1
I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest.|1
"i think ` ` rosemary ' s baby ' ' is the most overrated horror film out there . not scary , interesting , or even amusing , but it could be quite a letdown when you get through the movie . 
 "" at first i hated the movie so much that i just decided it was a waste of my time because it would be more fun on tv . however , later i started feeling bad for some of the other women in the movie who had made their feelings known to the movie . i really liked the way they spoke and how they dressed ."|0
Okay they tell you it's real. They don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - It's not real in the way you were hoping for. The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). Therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage.|1
i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club - - you know , those hip , hipster rock - and - roll groups that come out during the night ? no . it 's not like that at all . it 's really one of those classic film shows about a young man who comes out of the building and is killed by an animal or a group of bikers . it is not funny , so let me finish . this movie was supposed to be good , and i thought this was the most awful movie i could have hoped for but it was a total waste of talent .|0
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she was supposed to be a depressive, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more a depiction of a self-centered, worthless sh!tbag than a victim and survivor of depression.The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her. Sorry but I couldn't buy it. This is straight to video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.|1
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with.|1
"after seeing the harry potter movies , i ' ve been a fan of the trio actors rupert grint , daniel roesele and steve carradine . 
 "" what ' s wrong with you ? ! ? ! "" i scream as i slam my fist on the table trying to get their attention . they just look up from their screen and stare back at me in terror . it does n't help that i really wanted to know what he had to say . i hate when people lie to me . it ' s not worth the price of admission , even if it was true ."|0
"I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life, I cannot believe that I wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. Who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where those ""men"" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film."|1
"this movie was cheesy and it was more than that . it was about this guy who gets a curse and dies . "" i look up to find my mother watching the movie . her eyes are half - shut but her face still has the same smile on it . 
 "" i did not come here to make friends or anything like that . you have got to believe me when i say that if this movie were a reality tv show it would be a good one . it was just another way to waste my credits . i watched the movie for some time and decided to check it out ."|0
irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski ' s trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as a result . i am not a fan of that movie , nor do i consider myself one . however , i do know what it feels like to wake up every day without a television . so , i believe there is no reason for me to dislike this film . it is not too far from the truth . you just should have seen the way michael chaplin looks at his wife or how she acts around her kids .|0
The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat.|1
"my mother frank begins as a warm , amiable comedy about a middle - aged catholic woman ( frank , short for "" god "" ) living in america where her family has always had an eye for color and clothing . the film is based on a series of religious studies that were done at the behest of one of the founders of the american church . she is told to stay away from the religion and never engage with any religious groups or political groups that she might be able to relate to if she wanted to ."|0
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. Yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles.|1
Ah the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often I think, do you ever show good movies? OK you have given me the great 'Heroes' and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. I checked out the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact I am half thinking that this is a pseudo name).|1
First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning.|1
this movie has some good performances , as others have pointed out , but suffers ( as others have pointed out ) a great deal from the premise . i found it rather hard to see where it all began . i could not believe that these people would ever want to be actors . their roles were so terrible they could only be seen and read in the movies . no matter what we thought , or did , or saw on tv , they just were not my first choice for them . there was one other reason i liked the film .|0
"From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy ""beginning of time"" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth!"|1
Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I'm spending time watching the thing. I watched the emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world was the Empire Falls (excellent name)TV movie up for any awards? It truly had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend that was an OK (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? OK direction?|1
i am not understanding why people are praising this movie . i did n ' t like it at all . i was just trying to save some money and get my life back together . that is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i wanted to go to college but i did not want to do so . i think i would prefer to spend time with someone else who cares about me . there was nothing romantic in the movie . i got an idea and decided to read through a couple of titles . the first part was a little too bad .|0
what an awful movie . full of cliches , perplexing scenes , very bad acting , and an atrotious script that makes it difficult to know what to say when they have to . the ending is so boring that you can only watch it for about half an hour . i 'm sorry , but i have to give you a chance to relax and enjoy this movie . if you want to watch this film , i would like you to think twice before you do anything silly like watching something like this in the flesh . please just take the time to enjoy this movie .|0
supposedly , a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less accurate than another . there was only one major story , which is quite the problem . in this particular case it seemed that ufos were sent on a wild goose chase before they reached the country . the author said the film had not been released for nearly a year and it was not yet available in any type of book . i wanted to make my name known at first , but i could find no record of me being able to write the screenplay .|0
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home? How does it even get to be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and I use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? I'm all for DIY film making but come on! That doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie.|1
its all my fault . they all told me i should avoid seeing this movie because im a huge fan of the show and it took me two hours just to watch it . when i finished it , i felt that i was getting out of the habit of watching it but i ca nt help wondering what is going to happen when i die . i mean i have seen this movie many times before but never watched it in person . i am not sure if i wanted to watch it in front of the cameras or if i just wanted to feel some type of emotion other than being mad at myself .|0
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending. Heartwarming performances, action, humor, and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget.|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.|1
norm ( an ) ally i do n ' t mind remakes . there are some pretty good ones out there , so it is possible to find more than half of what i think there are . but that only makes it all the more interesting . this was not exactly a good way to start the book . i would have preferred something better . but since i am having a difficult time doing any other thing , i will say this . this book really stinks - it smells like a dead animal that has been eating its own tail for two days .|0
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset.|1
this film is great ! being a fan of ` ` the comic strip presents . . . ' ' i just knew i should be in that movie when i was a kid and not now . . . ' , i am going to take this opportunity to say thank you for doing so well on this one . but i can not thank you enough for the very first three months of my life . it also shows that people who believe that they are safe from the law have a hard time believing what they are seeing .|0
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary. It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds.I spent a few years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced Japan to get it. I was watching this with a well-travelled friend who's never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief.|1
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end.|1
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. The script left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara like rip-off of some Saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. Nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. I'm just amazed I found this at a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old VHS movies.|1
the opening scene really got me into watching the movie . however , not more than 5 minutes later , i felt like i was watching someone die . in my mind , i can see the blood and gore being poured out of the body and onto the ground . this movie could n't be better as it is the best thing i have seen in a long time , and for the first time ever , i actually get to enjoy it . when i say watched , i am talking about three movies at any given time .|0
"My son Adam (5 years old) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He like this film a lot. He particularly liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.Having seen the ""Vampire Rock"" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.Few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the TV cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. You either like this or love it."|1
for connoisseurs of bad movies , galaxina is a true gem . with truly horrid dialog , acting , and dialogue i 'm not sure what this movie even exists for . still , there are a lot of interesting characters . i hope the book will bring me out of my funk again . although i could make a real money as an actor if i knew what i wanted to be when i grew up . that is until i found out about the horror in which i had to leave home for so many days . at least i 've met some cool characters in the movies .|0
buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films , and they do n ' t make movies like the ones we just watched . this is because it 's more fun than what i saw on television , except for the fact that there is very little comedy in this movie . there were a great number of scenes where the characters seemed to be doing something different than they should have , which is totally unlike the way some of their actors act . i can not say i understand why either one or both of these guys are working for the dod .|0
i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd ( and it ' s follow - up { female prisoner scorpion series } for over three decades . however , after having spent two years trying to find a sequel to one of these videos , i simply couldn ' t take it any longer . in the end they all ended up being filmed at the very last minute and i decided to go with the original plan . if not for the film , this movie would have been a disaster . now there are lots of bad movies like this one .|0
When the Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager.|1
something not - so - great . ` ` silence of the lambs ' ' remains demme ' s only good film , and i ' m of little use to you at this stage . i ' ve seen better but i don ' t seem to be on it . perhaps you should leave the film in the back of your mind . that ' s the kind of movie you like to watch . i ' m not much of an actor . i did once read one of my father ' s many book reviews .|0
who said it had to be believable ? do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit through the worst of the movie . when they come out , you probably wo n't know what happened . i am so excited about seeing this movie that i forget all about my homework . i go home after class and ask if there is going to be something in it that i can watch while i write a story on the internet . nope . just an old book with a picture of the dead guy sitting by himself at the end .|0
"This movie was pointless. I can't even call it sci-fi, since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space. ""Max Q"" isn't even set in space for the entire movie. The story/plot is unoriginal, the cast isn't anything to write home about, although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film... Furthermore, it's not particularly exciting or well-told. At least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally bland."|1
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test.|1
why do people make bad movies ? did n ' t anyone working on the picture know that what they were making in this movie would be so great if you watched it ? there had to be someone who could help us . i just wanted to go back to the old days where everyone would laugh at those films . i still remember watching them on television when i was first here . we had no one to laugh at , but that does n't stop people from acting and doing terrible things to improve their performance . the director of this movie made me memorize this movie because it is very funny .|0
"This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother."|1
well , first off , the twins are exactly the same . there is no one is girly and one or two girls are good , but i do n't see anything wrong with having a lot of other girls who look great in those pictures . secondly , we have to keep it simple . this movie is all about little girls and boys . i can imagine that most teenagers would be looking forward to seeing someone like us make love on a big screen somewhere . as a matter of fact , i was hoping that maybe if i saw some action in this movie , you 'd want to watch it .|0
wow . . . i suspected this one to be bad . . . but now i find myself just at a loss for what to do next . it makes no sense at all . the movie was stupid , really ! there were only a handful of real characters that had anything in common with this particular character ( although the fact that he was the most gorgeous guy you could think of made me think that his character was nothing more than a little old woman ) . as we were leaving the theater , i heard a voice speak and when i turned around i saw a young girl standing on the sidewalk .|0
"Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France-we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. Polite, patient, genial. Although my French is testy, I got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the ""old"" terror growers interviewed-esp."|1
the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes . example : when dave retrieved his keyboard from the trunk of his jeep , he had no idea it was just there for a minute . he could have gotten it for some other kind of purpose but did n't . that is to say , he could have gotten it for anyone , but not him . i would never let that happen . i mean , why waste this much money on you when you could be saving money for a better story ? dave thought he could find something better - a more believable ending .|0
"What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's ""madness"" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction."|1
"MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous ""Enter the Dragon"" from '73, this one is an effort from South Africa. The villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a Baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the ""Dr.No"" or Han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany."|1
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when I came out I immediately checked into H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say I have been off the Hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since.|1
OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games aren't what I would brag on if I was over the age of 15. Cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. Just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't loose my girlfriend in that. Grease being the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical.|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best. She's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992), by the way. However, there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For instance, in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. We also shouldn't forget mentioning Extramarital's three main actors.|1
i ' m sorry but i just honestly can not see why anyone would actually like this . it ' s stereotypical of all the movies or movie stars in the world , except for the ones that have a good laugh . you ' re too young and naïve for this type of crap . the film was written by an old man who didn ' t know how to do anything else . the director explained that there is only one thing worse than a movie where the characters behave as though they are on some kind of medication or something .|0
our family ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience ) enjoyed ` ` the guardian ' ' . kevin costner is extremely interesting . i never heard of him , but i have heard about him in the school book club , or on television . it is one of those things you do n't really like to read for the sake of finding something interesting in it . in this movie , there is nothing very interesting about the way people are acting . they are not acting at all , they are just pretending to be actors .|0
"Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.Directed in part in a style similar to the ""Sympathy"" trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust."|1
it ' s hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon - like epic that for some reason has become a horror movie . the plot is really lame and so are the characters . i just want to laugh , but i could ' t do it in front of the whole class when they all had to watch this crap ! i wish i could find some kind of film that was funny . no matter how hard i try , i can not come up with anything even remotely funny at this point . everything about this movie is absurd ! there is nothing funny in this film !|0
Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. Paranoia reigns supreme as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's sanity. I've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know.|1
the movie is great for venezuelan tourism , birds , birds and more birds . only 1 piranha . nice to know how they can be eaten . i thought i was having a great film but i did not really pay attention in the script when i first heard about it . this one is awesome . the story centers around a man being killed by an animal . apparently there are some bad people who want to kidnap him . he goes off alone and tries to find out what went wrong with his body . he is very badly beaten as if someone had put a gun to the back of his head .|0
this movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate . my nieces have watched it non - stop since they ' ve seen it , but in this case we did not like any of the movies . one thing that i think is strange , there are no playstation 3 games to try and play at all . instead , we just watch video clips of everything that happened in the two weeks or so before the outbreak . the main reason this movie was selected is because it has such an easy and well - made storyline . i really loved this movie .|0
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. The movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. It had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.In short, I'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again.|1
I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve, and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. The extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is.|1
jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it . the only difference between the two , was that they had a little more entertainment value than their former leader who died in front of him . i am sure that most people would be able to find some humor in this movie if they were allowed to watch it once a week . there are times where i actually think that i will go home and die of boredom , but i know that my wife does not agree with this film .|0
` ` rouge ' ' is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own . it is n ' t just any story . there is something to this . it is the first thing i noticed about these characters as i was looking for a plot line . well , when you work with an old guy like me , it 's not so difficult to figure out what he is reading and what he has put in his garbage can . i am amazed at how many people watch this movie ( most of whom have been watching it since the early 1970s ) .|0
I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What were you thinking making three hours out of it? It may have a quite good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. It didn't have anything.It's got this strange, crazy science man with Einstein-hair, the classic thing. Not real at all. And a man keep getting younger all the time.|1
why ca n ' t a movie be rated a zero ? or even a negative number ? some movies such as that are not worth seeing , so let me try and get one straight out of the box . if this film is really good , i like it , but i hate having to watch it . there are too many characters here for me to just sit and watch it . i am in love with this film , and i am actually very disappointed by the fact that we will be watching it at this time .|0
film critics of the world , i apologize . it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public who will take advantage of you . if you do that then please get back on board and do a better job of helping me deal with this . let 's not make this harder on anyone else in this book than it actually was . so here we are again at the top of their list of bad decisions ( and good ones as well ) . the main thing i can say is that when people have a problem they have an awful lot of times to think about what happens next .|0
i must admit i was n ' t expecting much on this movie . i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i expected . i know there are some moments in movies where you actually have an idea for the movie . i did think it was going to be great , but of course i never got around to reading everything about the plot or how it was done . well , i did read most of the book , but not enough . after all , i could n't really write any of the scenes because of the way the script was set .|0
"breathtaking at it ' s best , intriguing at it ' s worst , francis ford coppala ' s groundbreaking epic ' apocalypse now ' . "" what ? "" i asked . "" did you just think this was funny ? "" i turned the tv back off . don ' t tell me you were in a movie that made you fall in love with your boss and lose your virginity by kissing him when you had no other options ? of course not . i knew it was true . so why could it not have been better ? i couldn ' t help but chuckle to myself ."|0
Let's get right to the heart of the matter...This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead Actors look like they were forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in pain.|1
thank god you ' re here is painful , positively painful . the title is apt , in a sense , for this whole scene portrays some of the characters in the book . i really wish i had seen it sooner . i was so happy when it was published , i actually missed it ! however , i do hope that you enjoyed the film as much as i enjoyed the first two episodes . please be assured that i would love to share this movie with you after this is complete . if not , maybe i will leave you a review .|0
you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting , but it ' s far from boring . i ' m afraid that the best comedy we have in the world is this one on the black comedy channel . so , let ' s try to enjoy the movie , instead of worrying about how people are really acting or whether there are any clues as to what happened to their characters . while the plot seems to be good , it has just been too short . the ending is more than an example for all to see .|0
"from the start of ` ` the edge of love ' ' , the viewer is transported to the striking world of "" the middle ages "" . after all , this was the first film produced in many years . i could understand how it would sound , especially as it has a plot twist , but these are just that : comedic films . so when i saw this show and realized that most of what you see is fake , i wanted to laugh . i had no idea what the movie really was . it looked more like something you might see on a cheap sitcom - nothing fancy about it ."|0
all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid ! it is pretty boring , and filled with all kinds of stupid plot lines ! you should see some of the characters who make me want to laugh in their faces ! the plot has to be one of the worst comedies ever made . there was so much fun that i just could not get enough . i ca n't explain why i am sad or why i am glad when i have a break in my afternoon work for two hours . it just seems so unfair that this film will last longer than the rest of mine .|0
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. The quality was so pitiful that I couldn't stand watching it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like Chris Hegedus.|1
another movie from swedish hillbilly country , which is always the northern part . if black people were shown this film , it would have been one of the worst horror films ever made , i could tell you . i know it is wrong to watch a movie like this but sometimes it is easier to think about other people that do it and they do it in the same manner . i really am not looking forward to watching this . it is awful . i ca n't wait to get home and read the reviews at the library on wednesday .|0
most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie ! it takes a long - winded bore to do this job , and i ca nt help but be amused at what is about to unfold before me . if you have a camera in your hand you can look through it at any moment ; but if you are watching the video you wo nt notice the lack of quality . the worst part of this film is there was n't much of a sound . the only things that saved my life were the voices and the laughter .|0
walt was particularly fond of quality . so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited film ? it is not as if there were any better than the original . the director said that he could take a break on the program because he needed to get something out of the way in order to keep filming , even though you can see him through the screen . i do not know why people have to make movies they love so much or why they pay for them , especially when they are trying to learn more about life and their children .|0
This film works on a lot of different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch it I'm not sure who to go call first--my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue.|1
this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all of the sequences . it did n't work . if you wanted to see something so bad you were going to watch it on your cell phone . i could n't get the movie down because my mind was in a place where it wasn ' t real life . i didn ' t like the way it made me feel , but at least it gave me a better view of the film than before . i loved the story and even the character .|0
a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . taylan biraderler ( taylan biraderler ) is one of our favorite films , and you can see why so many people like this one . it has to be a pretty good story . there were three characters who acted as actors in the film , but only one character was able to sing or play music , which made it very boring for the cast . we would like to give you a summary of the main characters of this film , but i really ca n't .|0
"Okay, enough. Every time I think I've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that I think that no one could possibly find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual inane ""Undiscovered masterpiece"" ""GREAT film"" - I mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox/MGM/UA DVD. There are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning."|1
this is one of the best martial art ( kung - fu ) movies of all time . if u love martial arts and you 're a great person to get along with , you should try it . i was thinking that the movie could be a little bit of an experience for you because most of the action is coming from the japanese boys and girls who are on the block . while this film is fun and funny , some of the characters do have a rough edge . i just ca n't understand how people can act like so many normal people .|0
This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves.|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2!!!). I could find nothing to redeem this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor but I doubt that's why shes there.The dialogue is truly appalling.|1
"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this ""movie"" left me stunned in my chair.It's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.This is the worst movie ever."|1
a remake can be successful . an adaptation can be successful . it is n ' t relevant whether its a remake of another movie in which the film is made with the same premise , nor even if the plot is similar to this one . just because there is a certain amount of work to do and we may get tired of seeing it do that does not mean that someone else can watch it . this was actually quite easy . the first 2 episodes were fairly interesting , mainly because people had no idea what i was talking about .|0
one of the movies i just did n ' t want to see . i got it in the sneak - preview , but i couldn ' t make out a word . so i looked at the movie , maybe because i wanted to read the titles , and when i tried to move forward i ended up falling asleep on the couch . i was tired of getting up early , tired of walking around the house , weary from sitting in my room for too long . i went back to sleep , not knowing what day it was or what time it was .|0
As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon.|1
i ' m sorry , but i can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought these characters were . no wonder they were so desperate to get it . they ' re such poor actors ! it was a waste of money and money for them to give this crap . even if you like the book , you should at least try to make up for the fact that you spent your time reading the same boring stuff over and over again . do not complain to someone who spends all his time on writing about something in a book he didn ' t even read .|0
"There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. This is the typical, ""I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army."""|1
Just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review? Yeah.I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to put into the script. I doubt it'll be published considering how poorly I worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. The sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.|1
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged?No.But that is not saying much.Like perfume on a pig.Seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.He lands in Prison and is befriended by a Gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.Its good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas it seems. Then an eastern European territory as usual.|1
As a fan of nearly any period drama, and at that a huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaption. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short. It felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtly to the relationships, particularly that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location. Despite having looked forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas I turned this off after an hour and went to bed.|1
as was mentioned by others , could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see it being filmed in london ? of course , my question is asked by all . i am not just looking for an answer to my question , because i do not have one . the director and the director are at each other 's throats , arguing about the merits of the film . i feel bad for people like this , thinking they should be doing something more important than watching this film , rather than watching this film with them .|0
"Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for ""Glory Enough for All"", a British series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was ""Danger UXB""."|1
i started to watch this show by accident , but i love it . the fact that main character is a zombie does not make him more of an evil character than anyone else in the movie . you see , we all live together in one big warehouse - like place and work out in there . it 's kind of odd because zombies are not supposed to have bodies with flesh , but they also do n't have arms or legs . actually , if you look closely you can spot the difference in the way they walk and the way they move . zombies ca n't talk either .|0
"This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around.His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his ""Penguin"" days from Batman."|1
two actors play rival gangsters in three films , the final of which is a sci - fi film , that nods and shrugs like it could be called a movie but it 's not . one day while i was waiting on the bus to come back from the theater for my train ride , i spotted some young people walking along the sidewalk . it was a friday night , and the streets were fairly empty as most of the stores were closed . as we drew closer to them , i became more and more nervous by the second .|0
I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot.|1
movie title - tartdate of review - 5 / 26 / 02year of movie - 2001stars - dominique swain , brad renfro , bijou ( the film ) , john lennon , and david kafka . all of these actors and actresses look like a bunch of skanks , and i ca n't imagine that they have any experience as acting actors themselves . when this story starts to come to the attention of other people , it makes me think : what is this ? this movie is one of the worst i have seen in my life .|0
I went to see this because I'd never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, since it doesn't offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. Her parents evidently don't care about her very much, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her.|1
ever since i first encountered the divine ms merkerson as a sex therapist in spike lee ' s ` ` she ' s got a nice voice too . but , it ' s not so great for people who really know about it . i ' m sure that most of the audience have seen this movie before and even if they did , would still love to watch it with me . i ' ll see if i don ' t regret this movie . let ' s just say that it isn ' t a bad idea . i can ' t imagine a worse movie than this one .|0
i just found out before writing this review that ` ` komodo vs . cobra ' ' and another movie called ` ` curse ' is the best movie i ever saw . it was one of my favorite films , with an odd twist to make it more of a mystery than a movie , but as you get to know the protagonist by seeing his face while he fights , the characters are quite different from the ones you see in horror movies or horror movies . for example , they all look identical to each other except for one notable difference : the person in question does not wear a wig .|0
this film brought a whole new meaning to that well - worn phrase ' like watching paint dry ' because this was ' like watching an old tv movie ' . one thing you know for sure is that the film is a comedy and it has no originality whatsoever . at times it makes my stomach turn when i find myself in there looking for some answers to questions i have but i ca n't really fathom why they need to ask that question . the answer is a little bit complicated so i think it will work out better if you just get on with the story and put it all into writing .|0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like ""The Others"") but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I was not."|1
There are movies that are so bad, they're good. Then there's movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. I can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all.|1
"caught this film on tcm in the early a . m . it was amazing . starting out slow but ominously . . . . scott is one of those "" i ' ve been through hell and back "" types . he is an author with a very good story , but has no talent to play it . his first book does not tell him anything . it is completely devoid of material that any of us could use to write it . what we really needed to know was whether this movie was a success or failure . after all , the guy was a complete moron ."|0
"this film was probably the best ""scary film"" i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer, you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry."|1
It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time. The storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I don't even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor.|1
the real life case of an innocent first nations chief ( the indian ) by an winnipeg city officer ( a korean , a japanese and mexican ) . when the police chief tells the victim that the crime was committed by a korean , they tell him that he is not wrong , that the victim could have been killed . but no one can prove to him that the victim is dead . after the police chief shows up , it seems like the story goes on into the middle ages which is pretty typical for the last five months .|0
Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so.|1
"The only reason I checked this film out was to see the ""early"" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a ""gripping suspense"", and it was three-star rated. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what has to be the ""disaster"" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. At one point, EVERYBODY is a suspect, including a frail old woman."|1
i really hated this movie and it ' s the first movie written by stephen king that i did n ' t finish . there was nothing interesting in that movie at all . when we left , i could hardly believe what i found out . not only are they working on a sequel to some of their movies , but they are making a movie that is completely unoriginal as well . this movie sounds pretty awful . i don ' t even understand why the people in this film ( or whatever they were ) decided to do this instead of just killing themselves . it is ridiculous .|0
i wo n ' t waste your time by describing the plot for this , the other reviewer already did this quite a few times . it is so terrible that it is like watching a movie from the start but with a lot of missing parts and nothing at all to make it any different than a film . you never want to see something like this again unless it is really bad . i found it very difficult to edit in the first place , but the book made me laugh . no one ever said i was funny , nor did they even try to make jokes about me .|0
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Sure it moved a bit slow at times. I liked it.As far as MST3K goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker for example.Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously.|1
not a balanced point of view . the director should n ' t express her opinion as truth . the movie has been very interesting for the first few days but soon you can see why people are interested in learning how it was made . we have tried to get into all the details , but i think they have already been too hard to dig and this film seems to be one of the worst i ever watched . i just want to know if there is something wrong with the lighting . i really wish i could figure out what happened here so i would have some way of making sense of it .|0
So, it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people--eye candy. But that's about it...a string of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy?|1
What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role.|1
"""Flashdance"" meets ""Meatballs III"" or maybe it should just be called ""Meatballs IV"". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: ""This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it"". ""Gimme An F"" has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her ""Clueless"" days."|1
a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley . as the film continues , i begin to get a better look at this story for the first time . it is certainly not the kind of film you see on cable television . these two actors are really close together and do not play each other often . they just sit side by side and stare out the window . one of them sees the movie with some interest and is impressed when it turns out to be nothing short of spectacular .|0
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home I raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie Finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas Gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie.|1
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13.Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue.|1
for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis . used too many non native speakers especially jamukha . not that we wanted to listen to this , but it was hard not to notice these people from the very beginning . there were all kinds of interesting characters , even the ones in the movie ' s most exciting parts . they both had great smiles ( which are not usually shown in real life ) and excellent voices ( mostly in a british accent ) . one could see why jamuka would become such a popular name . it was just a horrible movie .|0
"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp."|1
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey.|1
"i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films . living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in which they ' re not allowed to engage in battle . this film is really a horror flick - it is just as bad . it ' s been filmed by the most ridiculous characters from all corners of history . no one would believe me if i were to say , "" oh my god "" . however , it seems that you are seeing something completely out of whack here , so let me make this clear : it ' s not what happens when people watch it ."|0
there is a lot of repetitive dialogue in this movie about ` ` cold spots ' ' ( signaling the presence of an icy lake ) . it is n't very exciting , for example , and certainly not worth mentioning if you can avoid it . here is a picture of the lake on the first film . we are having trouble making sense of it - that is to say , the images are all mixed together with what they look like ; it is like trying to follow a soap opera . the two characters appear to be getting along okay .|0
okay , so i love silly movies . if you enjoy silly sci - fi movies , over the top movies , it 's all good . and then you get a glimpse of the real show . but how about this ? one day in mid - march , when a group of young people are hiking up the mountain to get ice cream , they see two men wearing skis coming towards them ; both are dressed in ski clothes with scarves around their heads , and each is carrying something heavy . the man who is carrying this heavy object also has a knife in his hand .|0
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime. Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other).|1
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money, she becomes Brown's property.|1
i appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ` ` the dain curse ' ' . my role is pretty simple but it is easy to see that this was a little more complicated than you expect , especially for a guy who has never had any of the time in his life to write a book . what 's not to like about this one is that it is such a disappointment to have a real fan when your idea is so much better than the one you just made up . i can tell you were very lucky to get all five - star reviews out of this episode .|0
Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion.|1
it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun : a call girl gets shot in the forehead . no one has ever actually made this happen , but that is the point . i 'm not going to pretend to know what really happened ; i just know it was bad . i knew it because i am a fan of horror movies at the best of times . i learned that in high school when i had to see it on the tv with my sister . it was horrible ! it was so disgusting .|0
the comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies , and let me just tell you - it is not a good idea . i can not imagine this movie happening in this age of many comedy movies . there is some great humor to the whole thing . but the main character is much older than he is ! what we do not understand is how these characters could be so bad as to have been so popular . for example , they look at each other with such mutual contempt and disdain that one ca n't help but dislike them ( no matter how nice the actors are ) .|0
"The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for ""emoting"" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would neither recommend nor watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue."|1
A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with Bugs, his next trainer. If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon.|1
"I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him I would have to take back my promise. We kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.This ""movie"" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100."|1
like the other comments says , this might be surprise to those who have n ' t seen the work of jeunet . let me make a few notes . i am an excellent editor and although most of my reviews are bad , this one is definitely worth waiting for . the original text was edited by the author , but it seems he had no intention of publishing it . his first two paragraphs were about making a deal with some new technology based on the internet . what do you think they would have done with this film ?|0
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. He's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick.|1
"Yes, it's a SBIF (So Bad It's Funny) classic. With a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely NO even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! Camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. Blood looked like watered-down cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the ""human"" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide.Did ANYONE involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was?"|1
At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this film enough, and I'll gladly watch it again.But boy does it have a lot of problems.|1
I love movies...and rarely do I see a movie that I hate...but this was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. Hands down... I cant believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. AWFUL! Do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful.|1
a couple of men are ship - wrecked on a remote island . they are then captured by an insane count who threatens to kill them if they get any closer to shore . that is how the world comes to meet the people , but it also becomes a whole lot more complicated . first you have to read this novel . what is the point of it ? well , let 's find out . i guess it gets boring after a while . i was about 10 at the time , so i do n't really know what to expect , but nothing like this .|0
"This movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is ""going down"" in the America of the late 1960's. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes.If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days,.. just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids! Thank God, his career rebounded before his untimely death.The writers on this television turkey were clueless."|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there.|1
"Man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh#t. I read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself........ Ah this seems like a half decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No,no,no way f*cking wrong. Jesus, if only I could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film, I would be happy. The lead actor had THE whiniest, gayest voice ever.Man!It really was bad....""Amandaaaaaaaa...."",""I gotta save my girlfriend...."" F*ck off!"|1
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.I often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics.|1
"RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955)To me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a Hollywood-remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business... How they're gonna pull this off?Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and went on to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some ""The Grandddady of all caper- and heist movies""."|1
rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the windy city , contrarian director peter dodgson takes it as a good sign to start writing . that ' s one thing we should all take seriously ; not because of anything like this but because it ' s so stupid - sounding . if someone asks you how you know these things , do you actually tell them ? i would have given my right arm to be there for this . i did n't want to spend more time watching this movie than i had to when i first bought it .|0
i loved this film , independent film - making at its best . the cinematography , pacing , rhythm , and acting skills were good , but the overall quality was so bad that you could not see where the movie was going to take place or where a sequel to this production would even begin . there was a great amount of writing on all sides , which gave it an edge . this film is well known for its lack of originality , yet it manages to be one of the few things that are actually entertaining enough to make someone happy .|0
"I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear"" that was shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own ""twist"" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a much better adaptation than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it is a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short."|1
christopher nolan ' s directorial debut is a memorable one . the film was very well received and help land contracts that were not even considered for the series . the story line , where i saw it , is an interesting one . i was not interested in this show at all - it had nothing to do with anything else . however , there is a lot of good stuff here and i wanted to get it out of my system so i will read about it . let me give you a free preview of the movie .|0
My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound.|1
my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of belphegor in the french 60 ' s . . . it is a good story , and i believe you may find the characters more believable than the characters themselves . as with most of the previous works , the plot remains consistent . this is just one of the things that i liked about the movie - it is not very original . but it has its moments . so do the rest of the characters . even though i did not spend time watching it , i found myself enjoying every minute of the scene .|0
black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car with three guys in it . i 've watched this film for years , and you ca n't help but have a strong desire to stay on the cover . if you can , though , please read this movie . i would like to believe that there are two people who truly loved each other , but that does n't really seem to be the case . firstly , i hope to never hear any of this movie .|0
"One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many people think the 'Woodstock Generation"" remained important throughout the 1970s; actually, it was all over at Altamont in 1970. By 1972, 'underground' rock or the 'counterculture' had moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black sabbath, and David Bowie, early metal-heads and the so-called 'glam-rockers,' who were all 'peace and love' - not."|1
"This ""film,"" and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: ""P.U., stinky poopies!"" Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. That said, there are a few bright spots. The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be."|1
i remember the events of this movie , the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968 , in the late 1970 ' 60s . but it is a film that does n't really happen . so what if it was not supposed to be ? why bother going into detail when you have already seen every one ? anyway , let me give you a heads up that this film has more or less hit rock bottom since 1995 . by the time you see the video , it is already on its way to be re - released in 1981 .|0
the kid - at 39 years old russel duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has never lost his way . in this film , it is hard to imagine who could have picked this character . i can not even imagine what he does for a living . when i first saw the movie , there was no point in saying anything . all i could see were some of the worst scenes ever made . the plot was too awful for me and i just did n't have the heart to say anything more .|0
lackawanna blues is a drama through and through . it details the life of a strong woman by the name of kim , but the main story is something about her parents ' murder . i would like to ask a few people if i can help any other way , but most of them are completely clueless as to who kim actually is or what her real purpose for being in this town was . some people think that kim 's parents had killed themselves so they would n't have to deal with their own lives , while at the same time they did it to protect their own children .|0
"i just viewed eddie monroe and i was very impressed . the story was easily paced as the plot unraveled , but not in any way interesting . it is certainly a good story and i wish it would have a little bit more of a feel about it , but there are some things you need to understand before you make an honest man out of yourself . firstly , i had to go through a series of many interviews on my cell phone . i really thought it would be good for me , but no one understood the concept of "" talking to myself "" ."|0
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer.|1
oh gawd . i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front room . this is the first video i have seen of myself acting at any movie since it started . i had just begun to make a lot of movies on my way to school when i was attacked from behind , literally dragged off into the arms of some man - woman . that was not even remotely funny . i think you should know better than anyone that this movie does not have a happy ending . we get a bad rap for this one .|0
Yeah, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting as well. The whole worm-looking-thing was really creepy in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] Anyway, lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode,The Good: The parasite thing. Awesome!Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww... <33It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear.|1
"Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic ""writing"" sure will.A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. Need I say more? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special."|1
when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr . coulomb , fbi agent dick martin , is involved in an investigation that may well have more to do with his recent disappearance and the whereabouts of the person who took him . since then he has been on the lookout for the elusive john ' s father and brother . both are now locked up somewhere . i hope they get out alive . this was my first visit to the u.s. capitol , and it was a big letdown . i spent many sleepless nights wondering why the president wanted to speak with me about such a preposterous case .|0
"The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it IS fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.This film, in short is atrocious."|1
this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going . the first scene shows a man that has been in love with his girlfriend for many years , but when she discovers him she is just as heartbroken . i do not blame her , there are some good parts , but none of them could have prepared me to deal with this . i can remember once when i was young i would spend every waking minute wondering why we ever went to such extremes for a couple of movies . i think my parents were disappointed in me for having so few choices .|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. Loch Ness Monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. Plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role.|1
There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty.|1
what has rajiv rai done to himself ? once a hit director of films like tridev and vishwatama is now the only actor left in hollywood , he makes sure he knows about everything from film to radio stations . this movie seems particularly interesting to me when i read it in an e - book format . however , i am not sure if i want to read that again after reading this first one . the main thing i do know is that there have been many times where i 've seen someone else doing this production at a time .|0
"for those viewers who thought the 1979 film ` ` alien ' ' the first to depict a male earthling being impregnated by a human woman . "" "" you think i should have seen this ? "" rick asked , astonished . "" why ? it was terrible . i do n't know if that movie ever took place or if it has been edited or if it was all written down somewhere . "" "" well , "" the director said carefully , "" it is not really filmed . the plot is based around the fact that some of the most famous people in history were married to other prominent men ."|0
This is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to Penthouse Serenade just as the opening premise (Hoppity's coming) may well have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name Disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect.|1
wow . the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid . i realize that this movie was supposed to be great . it was really good ! but i thought it was too good to let it go to waste . i mean , it was n't as bad as most movies are . well , except for one . ( 1 ) you can hear the music playing in your ears even when you are watching a movie and you do n't have to see the dialogue or any words that come from the mouth of the director . this movie is totally lacking in originality .|0
You know, I really hate IMDb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. But here we go. Editing time!Holy moley is this bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow I've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is just abominal. It's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him.|1
in thailand , the americans connor ( colin egglesfield ) and his girlfriend amanda ( meredith monroe ) quarrel in 1991 - 2001 - 2005 . ' s as if they did n't just meet in an american movie , but had been dating for a year . while i thought this movie should be over with by the age of ten , i think it is one of those things that only happen in movies when it is on a huge screen where people are being interrogated and then interrogated for information . i am not fond of this movie .|0
it ' s a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution . sure , it ' s horror and stuff , but i was more interested in what the rest of my book actually said . that ' s an even bigger deal than it ' s had to be ! i just don ' t understand why it ' s taken this long to edit out the whole thing . maybe there ' s no reason why this one should have been any good at all . if i were a fan of these two books , i wouldn ' t care to read those two .|0
"You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to Japan as his career winds down. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager (""Japan's Clint Eastwood""), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball."|1
i watched 40 minutes and could n ' t bear it any longer the television went off and i returned to the living room and put an end to the movie . this time i was really disappointed because there were a couple of funny movies that i would have enjoyed . i tried to pay attention in the next few minutes with my ears but it just wasn ' t going to happen , so i switched channels . i was looking forward to having the show over on screen . unfortunately , i spent the rest of the day watching old horror films .|0
"Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in ""Save The Tiger"" is Oscar-worthy, I feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.This is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member."|1
"This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these ""super human"" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies!"|1
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the 'Battle of the Tough Guys'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably.|1
i caught the first screening of driving lessons at the tribeca film festival . rupert grint shows he can act a bit better than his friends and is a great guide . i was hoping to see this film because i did not think that it would take up so much time . but , here goes . what if we are on the wrong road ? who could we possibly be looking for ? there seems to be a lot of people in this place as they pass through every day . one of them has the most boring character i had ever seen .|0
i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious , these are actually very interesting characters as well . i thought there were some interesting characters , but in the end it turned out to be just boring . for the rest of the film , it was only about three minutes long and it was not one of those films you can really get used to . i have always liked this film even though i usually despise it . i do enjoy watching my favourite films with other people , but what is the purpose of this movie ?|0
Well well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it by all ways. It's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA. So copies disappeared into the underground scene. All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. So it made this flick unique.|1
"As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the ""Millennium"" series) and of course Lorenzo ""Renegade"" Lamas, I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film. Sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. Sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from Microsoft Flight Simulator.The cinematography sucks as well. Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look."|1
watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning . and that 's because there was nobody here when it aired . if you can not get an image of this film in your mind , please use your imagination . no , really , i did n't make this film . i thought that a movie about two young men ( who are supposed to have been born in new york city ) will give you a real feel of what they look like as a couple but it didn ' t work .|0
well , great costumes and a wonderful ` feel ' for pre wwii italy . but what happened here ? i really wanted to learn about the film so i got a couple of things straight from it , not because i have any special understanding of this film . it is as if it is a work of fiction / movie . the dialogue is in such bad form that they were forced to give it an hour or so before they had to give it a go . the plot was very good though . we all watched it for some time . it could have been at least four years ago .|0
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par.|1
well , this is about as good as they come . there are arguments about whether hitchcock was only a cheap cover for the movies . i know i do not get along with my fans , but that does not stop me from being impressed . if you will allow me to start off on this journey with no real intention of giving it a name , please do so and watch this show ! ( i hope you love it ) . let me start by listing all the reasons we should not be seeing this show . first , there is the guy who runs it and the rest of the other directors .|0
The positives: It's shot pretty well. Has some interesting peripheral characters. Likable main character (albeit weak).The bad: Plot/story. Editing. Characters wasted. Jessica Alba.I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I don't dislike Jessica Alba--I really wanted to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable.|1
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
"This forth film in the ""Angel Guts"" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.Nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. Her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. But when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer."|1
"Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon,""High Sierra"",'41 along with Robert Ryan,(Howard Wilton),""Golden Gloves"",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection."|1
when one of my friends recommended this to me , raving about how well it was filmed , the underlying meaning of this book is that if i had been on the receiving end of every single detail , i might be in more trouble than i am now . i do not like to go into all of the gory details with such uninteresting facts . but as a writer , i really loved this series . it seemed so surreal to me that i found myself wanting to buy a copy and see what they would think .|0
Not the best of the WIP's, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. Yet the acting, dialogue, preposterous scenarios, and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm. As much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors go to Sybil Danning. Also, special kudos to Henry Silva, who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously.|1
this movie will not be considered for an academy award , but if you enjoy a movie that does n ' t make sense ( it should ) then i recommend this film . if you did like it or have some experience in it then you should at least read the reviews and get a taste of what it is going to be like . the only thing that gives any credibility to this movie is the fact that it has been edited and put on a dvd player . this movie takes place on a beach about 30 feet off the shore of florida , with no one around to talk to .|0
"its my favourite film because there ' s so much going on that you do n ' t see at first and so many of the characters seem to get it . what i don ' t want to see is a lot of action in the middle of some movie that doesn ' t make sense or interesting . "" we both chuckled at the pun and i got up from the table to go check if dinner was ready . as i entered , i saw a group of teenagers watching the show , and they were all sitting in the corner ."|0
my mom and i went to the ft worth premiere mainly to see george strait , but ended up getting an eyeful of a guy dressed in a white suit . it would n't surprise me if his face was not painted with black tar . that was the last thing i saw before my brain started functioning again . this was one of the biggest shows i had ever seen on television . i felt sick when i first saw it . they made me watch this because i thought it would help me feel better . after all , where else could it be to get a decent look at a real dead man ?|0
"As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The ""creature feature"" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone? ), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying."|1
If extreme activities (and I don't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts's obsession to prove himself against great odds. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.The filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him.|1
"Imagine every stereotypical, overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters. Throw in a mix of ""period"" music and wailing electric guitars during the ""rumble"" scenes. Then pass the time trying to figure out (or care) which of the Deuces is going to be killed in the (anti)climactic final rumble.I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical, or Oscar-nomination vehicle."|1
given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to the same plot . i hope this film goes well , i really do . i also hope that i get it right . i mean , you ca n't just sit here waiting for someone to show up and start acting like a psycho . i guess it takes some work to make sure that there is one person who knows what they are doing , so if you can figure out where you have been for the last few months , then you are going to want to come back in another century or so .|0
` ` valley girl ' ' launched nicolas cage ' s career and was an 80 ' s version of ` ` romeo and juliet . i do n't understand what any of them are talking about . i ca n't think of anything that could even compare to the movie . however , for some reason it was written so poorly . i have never seen this book before but it sounds interesting . it is a work of fiction . the film is obviously a production from the sixties and the acting is just as bad as the movie . i am not sure why i have ever thought this story would be worth reading .|0
"low budget mystery . a shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction . she was caught in a nightmare . we are watching this now to learn more about "" the plot "" ( you ) and how i can give you an update , or just watch it on dvd . also , do n't read too much into it because i doubt it will be interesting for long . i am here to see what the big story is about but i never get a chance to watch the play - off so i may as well have been studying the show ."|0
apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in . i have not seen all of their films , just the first three . i will let you get this one right . there has never been an original film and i am fairly certain it is because they did not really care about the movie . it is too horrible for words . the characters are bad , the plot is horribly flawed , and none of the scenes seem to be believable . what do they want ? why are n't they acting or acting at all ? why is n't this a good film ?|0
although this was the first hunter s . thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the involvement of an excellent director who had many films to watch on his private viewing network , and most of the acting was not very interesting . there were some good times , as well as some pretty bad ones . however , one thing about these movies that was a great deal better than anything you would find in hollywood is the number of errors that are caused by the actors who actually make up these movies . what do you believe about this movie ?|0
"the thing which makes ` ` fire ' ' even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry , is its lack of an explanation as to why "" fire "" would have been made so interesting in any case . but i do n't expect this film to be fun or exciting , and no one wants to play a movie where it does not really have a plot or plot at all . however , if you love this film , please find out what kind of people ( or creatures ) that are trying to create a good story that requires great imagination ."|0
i love this movie . yes , the main character lies , but that ' s why it ' s called ` ` the whole mess ' ) is not the best movie i have ever heard . it ' s not bad in some ways , but it still has a bad cast of characters and even less appeal in others . it ' s a really dumb film . you might want to get out more . oh well , if you hate it , just wait until i get a chance to show you one of my favorites . or maybe you would rather watch something new .|0
i ' ve seen some bible - based trash . this one tops it all . to make matters worse , it lasts for at least five minutes until the movie comes to its breaking point in a film where the main character becomes so obsessed with religion that she ' s willing to kill herself to get it . how do they know when to stop taking their own lives ? and who can tell what is going on in this movie , anyway ? if we didn ' t know better we would think that this was just a bad horror flick , but i ' ve never had much interest in any of those movies .|0
"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this?"|1
after a meteorite lands in ` ` boston ' ' ( really somewhere in the isle of man ) , a hideous horror film plays through . it 's not what i wanted when i got on the show , but i was so desperate that i thought there had to be something better out there . it 's a terrible idea for a movie director to look at one of his films and make a mistake like this . i know i do not live long , but i certainly did have a lot of good things going for my life before this episode .|0
A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy,the sensible elder brother.|1
Okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. Mr. Cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess?|1
"The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief, too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first ""chase"" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well."|1
"stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so i feel it must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen . why ? because we were going to visit a movie premiere that had gone on for months ! this movie is very good , and i hope you will like it . well , i was just waiting for the right guy to pop up out of nowhere while i was getting ready for the premiere when i found out my mother and brother were missing . "" "" oh my god !"|0
"When a movie's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. ""Soultaker"" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.The plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be."|1
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty.|1
` ` scientists at a remote lab experiment on ( insert scaly creature here ) and create out of control monsters . ' in this film , i am very confused about what the plot really is , especially since some of the scenes seem to have been taken from a tv documentary that was released sometime around 1982 . while i am not looking forward to these movie sequences , i am glad they were made by one of the most talented actors in the entire production . as well as being an excellent director and a great writer , he has done all of the right things , so why bother with wasting valuable material ?|0
Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.|1
Great acting, great production values, good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For instance, we're very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.This is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books.|1
since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution , one should sit back and enjoy the ride . there are times i would rather be anywhere else . as it turned out , the magus went on a journey through the land of djelibeybi , where he spent three decades in the jungle trying to escape his captivity . this trip made me wonder about him for some reason . how long were we on this trip ? why had we never met before ? why did we not get more information from him ? was there any other purpose behind this trip ?|0
anyone who critiques ' jacqueline hyde ' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it ' s intended to portray . there was a lot of ribbing about her for getting into bed with him , but no real violence . she even did some good with the sex . she really didn ' t do much in the way of action either - at least nothing that would put any of these people down . she didn ' t go on any dates ( not one date ) . i guess i just couldn ' t understand why so many couples would have an affair with such great sex .|0
[ contains spoilers ! ! ! ] garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut . they basically did n't even notice i was there until this day . but , i 'll let that one go on record as an embarrassing anecdote for the viewers . so , to be quite clear : this is not a scene from the matrix which can possibly be described in such a way as to make you want to puke . this is a scene where garfield acts like he has had a life all his own . he does not even have to speak much .|0
this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who , as a child , specifically asked for something because it appeared they had lost their money . i ' ve only seen two films in my life and i never quite get the feel of them , though i suppose it has to do with the fact that they ' re pretty boring . i just don ' t really know why anyone would like these things . we have lots of movies , and then there is the reality show , where you watch every single character at any given time and learn about them by looking at them .|0
i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper . sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies . i think i read some of the dialogue , that is if anyone has been reading any of the dialog . but i got ta say , i 'm surprised that you could ever come up with a movie in which one of the main characters tells the same story over and over . at least , that was the first thing that caught my fancy . i thought it looked good , so i ordered it anyway . i did not know what to make of it or how to make it look better .|0
The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by.|1
i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences . i guessed the film will be interesting . in fact is quite good , even better than it is for me to admit . the main thing that makes this movie interesting is the plot . when you look at all the stuff that you are learning from this book , you begin to think a lot of what is wrong with this movie is right there in front of you . if you ca n't see how great the movie is , why not take a look and see what everyone else has missed out on .|0
"this is a totally awesome movie ! if you have n ' t seen it yet , you damn well should .

"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an ""intelligent person"" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported ""genius"".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them."|1
most people will consider that yul brynner ' s greatest performance was as the ruler of siam in the king and queen ' s house ! i mean , really ? is that supposed to give a sense of importance ? this is one of my best productions of the year . it ' s an undistinguished scene with only a few words thrown in at the beginning and ending , but it ' s so hard for me to concentrate on the movie when my stomach is doing flip - flops all the way to the center of my being . i ' ll admit i don ' t have much patience for the film .|0
"Obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the ""Blair Witch"" wave.This movie was set up like all the ""reality"" haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately (and I must admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the ""participants"" going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups."|1
this is a pretty obscure , dumb horror movie set in the 1970s everglades . it is really stupid and unoriginal , but it serves its purpose . while the movie is not as bad as the films i watched before , it is rather boring . i have seen plenty of horror movies in my life , and i always found it hard to believe that even a small child could be so stupid as to write down a plot like this . it has to do with their mother or sister being killed by a bunch of kids .|0
i awarded this presentation 4 stars . they are all for the script , which has been butchered beyond recognition . i am not sure how i got here ; i just came in looking for something to put on the spot as i sat there trying to think of an excuse that could be a good thing . this was supposed to be a film about a girl who finds her life in limbo . well , what a crock of crap it was - she had never seen this movie ! no matter how funny it was , it still did n't make a lot of sense , or even make any sort of sense .|0
this neo - film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century american films that all seem to involve corrupt people , but as far as i know , there has never been anything like this movie . in fact , the only reason i saw it before was so that i could spend some money and find out what went on . it was an odd thing to watch at 3 p.m. , but it did make me feel a little bad about myself . then when i got home from working on my manuscript , i immediately saw the story of a family with three younger daughters .|0
"The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That's the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of ""liberties"" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable. )The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area."|1

From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war.|1
i thought that this movie might be a good spoof , or at least a good independent comedy like friday night , when a young girl is arrested and tortured . if you see anything that would help , do yourself a favor and call the number on the back . there are some really bad movies out there but i think i would rather go through life watching them than watch it in person . i am not much of a fan of movies but i had to get used to the idea that someone was trying to rape my friend and her boyfriend .|0
this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen . probably ` ` okul ' ' is the worst part of a movie , as if every single character involved in it will turn out to be something else . i saw the film and it has a nice theme with no drama whatsoever . this was one of those things that should not happen to me . well , actually it was bad . the plot was totally uninteresting but there is a very good reason why all of this stuff is supposed to come out at any given point in the films .|0
"I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in ""Tigerland"", and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough ""leader"" character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Flash forward 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose."|1
"i have for years remembered a song ` ` just a couple in a castle ' ' ( ` ` no . twenty miles from london ' , "" she said .

i simply can not understand how any who fan , or just plain anyone could find this awful , lazy - minded city so appalling . there are hundreds of places to be seen and not one has the slightest idea what you are talking about . it is a lot like the movies where all the actors are forced to do things they despise in order to remain alive . everyone tries to look good while everyone else seems to be doing horrible things . no one wants to participate in a film because they are afraid to put their fingers in the paint .|0
First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie, I can't comment on that.However, I DID see the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on that Channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.I've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so.|1
this movie was made by daiei studios , known for its gamera movies . it is about a samurai lord who fights his opponent , and kills him when he gets too close . the character looks like a man with dark hair , but does not fight at all . as a result , there are several films made in an attempt to take the film back from daiei 's critics . after watching the movie , i learned that daiei knows how to use his sword properly and that he is a very strong - willed warrior who goes after his opponent .|0
although i was hoping that i ' d like it a little more , this was still certainly an impressive film . there is just so many different styles of music , video games , etc . i have watched most of them , and they were never really as good as the ones i watch now . if you saw this movie , you would have probably laughed out loud . let me tell you what i didn ' t know about this movie : it has some very bad scenes from the first ten years . actually , at times it got worse than this .|0
"If you want to truly experience the magic (?) of Don Dohler, then check out ""Alien Factor"" or maybe ""Fiend"", but not this. Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but ""Nightbeast"", which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor, is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor."|1
if this movie had been directed by a man , he would have been jailed . while adrian lyne was very attractive - i should not have even noted the way in which he treated her - there was something strange about her that seemed to pull him in deeper than i would like . i thought she was pretty , and that made her intriguing . unfortunately , her appeal fell on deaf ears because she lacked any genuine interest in other men . how could such a young looking girl who looked like she was in her early 60 's want to fall in love ?|0
still have n ' t read a single dan brown book , but i watched all his movies adaptations . i wo n't lie , they were cool . i actually enjoyed watching them in person and felt like i had finally come home to a good story . i would say that some of the characters were great , but no one could tell us who they were . i was surprised that even though most of the plot was crap , it ended up turning out fine . there seemed to be less about this film than before , so what did that mean ?|0
I'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog. The film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight some more. There brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship.|1
I always loved this film. The music,story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte' after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam.|1
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time.|1
i am from romania . . . and for that i apologize if my english is not so good . i just finished watching the first of many movies at home - a movie that i had no idea how to make , let alone which ones i liked . i did not even realize it until i sat down with all the others . this film is the best comedy i ever saw - though it is one i do not have the energy or imagination to describe . i was very disappointed when i watched it yesterday . i thought i was going to sleep through this movie !|0
There wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie but that's about it.- The movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.- My understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age.|1
as is the case with many films of this ilk , my non catholicism got in the way of my good humour . no doubt , some of these people are going to have to pay the price i am about to put on tonight . however , i have a better idea ... i will make a few phone calls and introduce myself . you know , an old movie that comes from the great american cinema theater . well , this one has been working for a few years , but it 's not so bad . there is very little drama at this movie .|0
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.OK what about the plot outline?|1
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it."|1
"******Spoilers within******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clichéd bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself, ""Let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?"" Yup, I was right."|1
"This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (""will the show STILL go on?""). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film."|1
"There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. It was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. Compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. I kept thinking ""it must get better."" It got worse. And worse. How on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews I see of people actually loving the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad."|1
"I grew up watching the ""Bowery Boys"" on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. Still it was fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs would beat the crap out him. The East Side Kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am repossesin about my childhood."|1
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids.|1
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January (2005) I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so unlike her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.|1
I would not recommend it whatsoever. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except The two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did smack of Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers.|1
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. The actors - I think all of them are amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it.Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. The lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: ""I´m the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual."|1
"This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her ""Follow Me"" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place."|1
"I just realized why the colors and sets in ""Sakuran"" were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn't call it acting."|1
this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that , i believe , is not equaled today . the colorful theme , from which a few people have managed to convince others how they are ' making it big ' by putting their personal lives at risk , has now been cut into pieces and put back together for a very good story . in the past few days i have watched some of the worst scenes i have ever seen . it is only after i have watched it that i get a really bad feeling . even as a professional wrestler , i have never experienced anything like this before .|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls.|1
"On the positive, I'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called ""buzz"", and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would've been amazing."|1
"i was waiting for this movie for a time . in the first day of the air in turkey , it had to be a new movie because it did n't have any plot - or even any idea what it was going to be about . we were so engrossed by the film that i had no idea what to expect when the director said , "" okay then , let us begin . "" after a few minutes of looking at the images , the director explained how the movie could be good . there were some pretty bad scenes , but mostly it was a fun and exciting series ."|0
i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now , but having just sat down with this man , it does feel very nice . for one thing , i have no clue if this is something of real importance . that should be easy to explain since we can all make up some story in our imaginations , but alas , there are too many pieces missing . the book is so much more than i could ever imagine . at the bottom of the page and on the right - hand side , you can see the whole movie .|0
this was a sordid and dreary mess . i needed a shower when it was over . it goes something like this : you go out with your partner to be married , get pregnant , meet the parents , run off to paris and then live with them for a year . in the end you move into a crappy apartment and start thinking about what you wanted to do in life . you begin to believe that if you are not good enough , everything will be okay . the only way to survive this is to have fun !|0
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them. It basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. After viewing the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. IT'S NOT ENTERTAINING in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women.|1
i really love this movie . it has a very real feel to it . i believe it was never based in reality , at least not yet . as you go on reading this , you are going to find that most of the characters in this book are actually more than actors or actors . here is one of the most realistic parts of this movie , where the character goes off and meets someone who seems to be trying to get him to commit an affair with her . he tries for a while to win her over . when he gets to her house he finds out she hates his mother .|0
the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960 ' s broadway musical that became famous because of it . i think you have a few people who want to see it , and i 'm not one of those . they 're just as interested in seeing the real action as we are . the opening scene was filmed by an african american woman dressed in a very bad indian dress . she walked into the middle of the studio without trying to be cool or funny , and nobody else did . the show had a great cast and crew .|0
personally , i do n ' t like a lot of b / w movies , but there ' s something magical about this movie . and it ' s just the way it ' s acting . when it ' s playing to you , you get so excited that you actually have to pee your pants . if you ' ll admit it , you ' ve been waiting all this time to find someone who can ' t resist making fun of you , for some reason . well , i ' ve had enough of being bullied in school . i don ' t have to endure any more humiliation .|0
"This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a ""10"") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie."|1
julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson , while on an adventure in france . this movie is even better than one of those stupid horror movies where no one knows who it was until the director figures it out and tells it how to be a hero . this is nothing like any of the movies i have ever seen , and it has my heart pounding so fast that i almost feel sick as i watch the movie . there are some interesting scenes but most of all i just can not comprehend their meaning .|0
hehehe . this was one of the best funny road movies ever ! i laughed so i fell out of my chair and had to be on my way home from work in order to see a movie that i have n't seen since 1973 . at first i thought it was a bad one , because there were too many times that we were all laughing and trying to watch the same movie . but after a while they started to get really good . it did not end well for everyone , though , so i decided to keep watching .|0
i still remember watching satya for the first time . i was completely blown away . here was a movie that could only have been done at a single hour and she had made her way into it with no thought of what the credits were worth . this is the worst film i have ever seen . not because i watch movies as a kid , but because i saw one on dvd . i hate movies like this , but this movie was absolutely disgusting . how could you just watch someone make an entire movie by themselves ? even if they do have a couple of good acting skills .|0
"the reviewer in variety said this was ` ` overwritten and overlong ' ' , and i kind of agree with it . "" "" that does n't really tell us what we have to worry about , "" mark said , "" especially when you get into a serious situation where an entire world is on fire because of your stupid tv shows . there is absolutely no sense in wasting time or money on those silly movie ideas ! "" mark paused for effect . "" okay , let 's just put the movie up and then go back to listening to some other dumb crap that is not important ."|0
I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out.|1
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city. A low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. The finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then.|1
a film by almodovar - sends a tingle down my spine every time . the capitalized print which opens the spanish civil war is extremely short , but i have to give it to him that he gets the gist . the plot of this movie is not particularly interesting and seems to be pretty simple . when i was 18 years old , i watched a series of tv programs about the history of the roman empire . they are full of political intrigue and conspiracies . i had just gone off to college in the states so i was curious enough to watch one of their shows .|0
of all the movies in the history of movies i ca n ' t imagine someone sitting down and saying , i am sorry . i just do n't know if it is worth doing this . well , what can i say that would work ? we need some action , a new genre to try and make people laugh . who ever said you had to be an athlete to earn a $ 150 a movie like this ? i have never even seen a basketball game , let alone actually watch a movie . as far as anyone wants to know , i got no interest whatsoever in watching a tennis match .|0
the concept : show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of l . a . preparing for the family get - together , it is not as bad as i had been led to believe , but i ' ve only seen one or two of the things that you can ' t make out , so it is a dead giveaway . the story is good though . at least they know who their father is and what he did for them and where he went . my mother is a very nice lady , but there are a lot of negatives on her character .|0
the greatest tragedy man faces is that , capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal . from this day forward , i think my life can not be any more boring than when i lived in new york city . at least there i saw some good movies and enjoyed a bit of entertainment during my time here . it was n't really the kind of film i expected to watch , but i suppose i thought it would improve my mood . i felt i could learn a great deal by watching this series .|0
this is a film that has to be taken in context . it should n ' t be seen unless you ' ve got a good eye for it and the plot is more than just a little ridiculous . this is actually a bit of an absurd idea , especially as the scenes are so disjointed , but the actors are not even close . i don ' t know which is worse : watching these two guys together , or watching the two guys in front of me . it appears that neither of them can control their actions at all .|0
"Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. The actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.This production offers the disclaimer, ""For dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts"", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a Bible story which needed no drama added."|1
After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time.|1
wow ! ! talk about a film that divides the audience ! this is a real love it or loath movie , so you should n't be surprised . in fact , i really think this movie is something to be excited about . do you think that it was just a ploy to get rid of some poor actor who did not make it as well as he could ? after all this time , there is still some merit to this movie . and , it has its good points . at times , i have felt like this movie is meant to be about hollywood .|0
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer.|1
"Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical ""junior high"" experience. They make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. I can't stand the fake French accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually ""fall"" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parenthesis? Because its all stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit the Mary-Kate/Ashley mold?"|1
up at the villa ( 2000 ) * * 1 / 2warning : you may find some spoilers aheadit ' s hard to believe that it didn ' t just jump off a cliff or even a cliff and fall into a crevasse on its way to the surface . what i really do not understand is how this thing could have gotten here in the first place . however , all of this is well thought out but still not worth seeing so much as an explanation . let ' s watch this movie where they go to the museum of natural history because there ' s no reason to leave anything out .|0
i was expecting a lot from mr . amitabh bachan ' s role of sarkar , but am disappointed . being a ram is the worst thing that could have been done to it . it is an unflattering and boring story set in a remote part of africa . as i was reading it , i knew this was the book for me . how dare they make such a good movie when it was not their fault we are not even at the same stage of life . the whole plot was contrived by someone who thought he or she was going to live out the most incredible life .|0
"The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. It is obviously much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. As long as the material's right.The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D"" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage."|1
i had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory , non stop . i just love these movies . i was n't very fond of them myself but i like the story they have . in fact , i have seen almost every part of this film . i enjoy the stories , but prefer to watch them in person . what i really like is the dialog of the actors . while the scenes are somewhat different from those i first watched , it does not make you want to be a vampire ( or an alien ) as much as it does .|0
"To paraphrase Thora Birch: ""I kind of like this movie. It's the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film"".This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD, you could do a lot worse."|1
Watched this film at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. A simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot.The film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.|1
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud.One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
"To start with, I have done some further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. Secondly, This was a very low budget film, created in the Rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. The producers of Rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, ""surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop)."|1
forget any angst - ridden documentary ! this film is really an out and out comedy about a 40 - yer - old porn star whose only crime was that he could not use his sexuality . there are so many characters , so little of the original dialogue . i ca n't even get into the plot . all it gets me is more bad movies . the acting is atrocious . the plot is completely wrong with some parts . i am having trouble concentrating . my mind goes back to how much fun it was playing as a teen , and how glad i am that the movie is over .|0
Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the dialog. And the music was nothing great. Anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. And what does a Kansas teen know about shopping in Soho....couldn't we have had a better line here?|1
man , i ca n ' t believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . okay , it sure as hell ai nt like the movies in this movie where the guy has a bunch of weird people in his face with pitchforks . this film was supposed to show some kind of horror genre , but there is nothing that i am prepared to watch in this particular scenario . so , let 's take it from the perspective of the most bizarre characters i have ever seen in all of my life . first , we are told they are evil , yet here we are , talking about them in the cinema .|0
"After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another James Toback-directed mess called ""When Will I Be Loved"", I've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.I like Robert Downey Jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.Heather Graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.Such a crappy script."|1
so im not a big fan of boll ' s work but then again not many are . i enjoyed his films for the second time and had been reading him as if he were a book . now i can see how this would have been an extremely good job . he made a good movie . i loved every part of it and was amazed at how quickly he managed to make it sound almost musical . i also enjoyed his movies which is one of my favorite authors . i love all of the books that he has published . i do n't think anyone has seen the whole film yet .|0
"for several reasons , this movie is simply awful . other posters have listed some of this movie ' s historical characters ( the first one to appear was in 1974 ) and they are quite depressing , but i will not stand for it being the first film that has made it this bad - on my end . the title is atrocious : a crime scene with no hope of success . "" i do n't understand why they wanted to take out their anger on me as if i am the devil himself . i want to be mad at this movie ."|0
the plot : michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct , and is looking for his 1st born son of a senator to take over . he was working for a film company where he thought he could ' d make a decent film . it ' s just not happening . i ' m glad that he went to work for the show , but what happens to him when his father discovers him dead in the woods ? there ' s no way that this will ever happen if you ask me . i would much rather die !|0
another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner . technically , it ' s horrible . the acting is bad , and the actors mean well , but it has little to do with their own talent or character . i think you could say that they are actually very good actors in this film . the characters are extremely difficult to tell apart from each other . the dialogue is awful and there is no sound . i was thinking maybe we could write a series about this . i can ' t decide if i would be more upset if i won ' t see any of the characters play so well .|0
"although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome , ' caligula ' is not made in the style that it is in the painting . as you may know , "" caligula "" is an american actor , whose story is totally different than any i had ever read . he is very popular in america with his co - stars and movie critics , who enjoy a good acting career . however , when he gets into a film , his ego gets the better of him . this movie is all too much to handle , and he has no idea what he will get out of it ."|0
I've never understood this type of spoof movies. You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots.|1
"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end."|1
"y ' know , it ' s very interesting watching this . . . half the people involved with it are now dead . . . anyways , i am afraid that we will have to leave this show . i was hoping if we had some time to talk later in the week , i could just say that this is so boring that we would n't want to watch anymore , and then i could tell you how sorry i am for everyone 's loss . please give me a call tomorrow or the weekend after . thank you for coming .

well every scene so perfectly presented . never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost any movie , and it definitely is not an easy one . i just could n't tell which of the four characters was the real villain and which was my character . after the movie i sat in the audience and watched the scene from the beginning . i tried to avoid thinking about how i missed out on watching the movie . i looked up when the credits rolled and noticed that there were only a few people left in front of the camera . this was pretty awful .|0
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice , bouncy jugs . but that is not enough for me because it is such a disappointment . there is just so much more here to do than just sit about waiting for women to look good . it seems that all i have to do is listen to someone else play music on some stupid ' radio ' set . and then i feel sorry for the first guy who shows up on my floor . i had been watching this movie for 20 minutes , and still it did n't really register on me what it was about .|0
Sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. The movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall. If the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non-stop for a week, the music will.|1
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Have it scripted by a 10 year old. Have the acting done by A-Level drama students faking really bad US accents (in the Isle of Man!) Add monster special effects that the lovers of B&W Dr Who shows will appreciate. Result: duff film. Throw in Samantha Janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!|1
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite.|1
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture I can only think this is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. This movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.|1
i ' m not here to tell you ` ` armored ' ' is kubrickian , hitchcockian or fellini - esquire . nope . referenced in this story is a list of the characters and locations for this movie . my name is not listed anywhere in the movie but i have been chosen to be the starring writer of this film . it ' s an old movie with a bad plot and terrible dialogue . it was actually a great movie as i ' ve seen many more movies in my time but there ' s something really awful about it .|0
"What a mess--and I'm not referring to the ""destruction"" in the title. I could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there weren't any palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it at that.Hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on IMDb.. OK, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing."|1
"have to agree that this movie and it ' s talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve . here is what i did try to explain to you , the film is not a success . in the end , i was pretty good but the character is mediocre . at least she does n't show any signs of being an "" evil "" villain . there is also nothing about her demeanor that would be believable otherwise . as for the plot , i tried to come up with an idea but could think of nothing that worked . she is totally out of his league !"|0
What can I say about this? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End? Wasted Time, wasted Money.This work a disaster is historically seen. Only some examples:* Augustus often is named 'Gaius' - his First name (Pronomen). But the old Romans don't used this Name. Correct would be the Surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. * Livia was shown as tyrannic Wife. But this historically wrong. * Iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one.|1
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle.|1
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. This film goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society.|1
As kids movie it is great. For the family it just sucks. I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all ages. This movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was however a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka.|1
John Knowles modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, are one of many subtle, and subtly is the watch word, themes of love, hate, jealously, denial and regret. The 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - A love story with war looming in the background. The 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story. What is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes maybe it is arguable, a gay love story.|1
lovely candace bergen as the widow perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik raisuli played by one of the most powerful hollywood stars ever born . there has to be a good explanation for why these aliens were released on the island of san francisco but i just ca n't see anything . i think this movie should be thrown out because it is so boring and does not make much sense . what can that possibly relate to ? why did they get taken from their world ? why have they been raised in such a bad environment ? why have they been given all the help needed to keep them safe ?|0
one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made - for - tv movie , it would take an hour to watch . there was n't a single thing written on the film : no pictures of actors or actresses , nor any scenes in the book . but i could n't help but feel like this movie was doomed to fail eventually . i mean , what else could be said about a bad movie ? if you read the reviews , then let me tell you that it is a horrible story ! i am not sure how good the script actually is .|0
well well , at last a view of this underrated flick . but you ca n ' t find a good copy in this store , it seems to me the whole thing is on the wrong track . i just want to see who would make such a huge mistake . there is no way that they could have made this kind of show and gotten away with it . i am not saying that people should get away with something like this , i am saying that there are certain kinds of actors that deserve to be treated better , but some of these actors simply are not deserving of the talent that they have .|0
in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple . hulk hogan would take on roddy piper , or bobby kennedy , to make the game a nightmare . at least these are some of the worst films i ever witnessed . let us get this movie out of the way right now . it 's not that bad , if you ignore all the obvious things that we see and listen to during the movies . they have a very decent script , which should make the movie interesting . but then again , for all intents and purposes there is no ' premise ' here .|0
watched this film with an audience of . . . . 5 in total ! had a choice between lakshya and asambhav . . . and , to tell you the truth , i didn ' t think he would take it well at all . there was not a single question in that film that he could not or wouldn ' t understand ! he ' s a real character , as you can see : he plays his own roles and is very much one of us . his character is completely different than any of ours ; his character is a complete stranger to me , and even more so from my point of view .|0
Spoiler with plot explanation: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy (that pops out from nowhere, and no questions asked... ) that went wacko, and Casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death. With every frame movie gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending seams completely dumb, it has nothing to od with the movie itself, i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s**t this way or other, so it may as well have a stupid ending.|1
this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie , but apparently not . so let 's go with one of the things that scares me the most , i think this movie probably does not give a crap about how we live ( though i have to say some of the stuff ) . there are a lot of people watching it . when the movie comes out , you can see just how different it is from the others . in fact , if i was to take a really good example and watch this film , i would call it the ' 80s .|0
i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off . knowing this was a blaxploitation film , i am happy to have seen it in the first place . let us see if this can be retold by one of these characters that will come from the movie and try to emulate it . please leave a review at your favorite retailer where you would like to see more of this film . do not hesitate to post an email here : http : // infinitywsstl ( e ) . all of the subscribers are invited to join our indie / sci - fi magazine .|0
in short this movie was awful . i understand it ' s a disney movie , which are generally shallow movies with mediocre effects . but to be honest i had hoped for more of a high quality comedy . i did not expect any of the other cinematic stuff that could be thrown in . it was all so boring i wanted to shut it all down and try to figure out something better . the best i can find is an interesting film that has a lot of elements that seem like they are making a mistake . basically it reminds me of a bad soap opera , with no action .|0
sorry , after watching the credits , i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf . however , it did n't come off very good . it looked more like a comedy than an acting director . there was a bit of a laugh - out , but only one of its critics was funny as hell and the guy who gave it a go has been gone for over 30 years ! that movie was in the fourth or fifth grade and everyone knew how great it was . so i went through with it .|0
Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.As per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that's gotta count for something!|1
"a group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals . when they have discovered it they decide to bring it back to civilization . but there are no animals here , the land is covered in thick forests and jungle . this was obviously a bad idea . what is one thing i want to take away from this movie ? do n't you find that very disappointing ? "" he turned around and began walking again . 
 "" i 'm sorry sir . i did n't know you were a fan of this movie ! "" i replied ."|0
"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt""."|1
when i was five years old , it was my favorite television show . i remembered it was on channel 8 so i would not have to watch it for a year . i liked what i saw because it was the only show where people from other worlds actually watched it . this show is a movie about a couple of humans who do not believe in aliens and want to take over another planet . if they did , let me warn you that there would be some really good things about this movie as soon as i watched it . we are allowed to watch all our dvd movies at a certain time .|0
Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD.|1
"i saw this film on 19sep2009 at the cambridge film festival . the beagle ' s only in a couple of weeks because he ' s so adorable and such an easy - going dog . when i told my mother that i was going to see a movie , she had me turn it down until after the next day . "" "" well , you should be proud , you ' re actually going to see a movie ! what is your first impression of this film ? "" asked don ' t you dare tell me you didn ' t enjoy it ."|0
"Barely came trough the whole movie... Acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. Felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled trough. They even screwed up the sound. At certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. It would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.Oh and PS: I don't know what's this guy ""Uwe"" capable of creating..."|1
"Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is ""manager"" Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him."|1
i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film , since it is padded to hell . if it were just a regular movie , there 's a good chance some of the characters would be great , but we will never understand where they get their idea of comedy . in fact , the only one that really makes me smile at these stories are the ones that do n't even make any sense . each one has some kind of weird plot , something about a boy and girl who are going out for a run together . the whole thing just feels like a stupid fantasy .|0
ben marshall , a teen ager from a religious background , is made aware about the financial situation at home . it has been suggested that if they do not pay for the house , there is no way they can be allowed to get an attorney . as you can see , this kind of thing is very much out of character for him . his parents were poor and their son was constantly bullied and treated like a child . he became obsessed with the idea of being an adult . he started acting like a child most of the time .|0
"This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about ""God"" and ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.AVOID IT!"|1
"This film was utterly horrible. Stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. Whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. Reminds me of a hack student film, BUT WORSE. Who ever produced this should give up now. I know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this ""fantastic"" as some think ""Dune (1984)"" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. OK, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers."|1
Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. I don't so I thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. Thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in Season 3, and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in Season 3. So, overall verdict? Just read the summary at the top.|1
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do.|1
"al pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity . as a result , the film was made for two - year - olds and is written in three days , just so you know . i mean , i do not have the time or energy to spend watching this movie . however , it has one interesting theme : it is still ' 80s . at least 50 years later , people still refer to this movie as "" 1972 . "" what happened after that was rather strange ."|0
Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot.|1
"a very , very , very slow - moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man . not sure if i want to laugh or cry , but i do . 
 ' that was pretty good , ' johnny said . ' where did you learn that ? ' ' never saw it before , but there were some movies that i watched as a kid . i was in the eighth grade when my dad was out of town on business and came over for dinner . he 'd just had his first meal since he 'd found out how many people lived in maine at the same time as him ."|0
I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, not having read any of his book, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us.The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. What? They can't afford a room?|1
i watched this movie and all i can say is this . . . i am not a film student , nor am i the kind of person who likes comedy . if you think it would make me look good , you must be wrong . but i still love it . the first thing i saw in this movie was a very bad movie about a young man caught up with a great deal of money and a group of rich people looking to ' help ' each other . it had no humor whatsoever . the plot was awful .|0
"I am utterly astonished at how over-rated ""Cemetery Man"" is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and I love just about every zombie-comedy I have ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult-classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his retarded, man-child, Curly Joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death."|1
Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped.|1
even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries , odds are you will find this one fascinating . not only that , the idea of being able to see things from a movie is very appealing . i really had no idea what i was witnessing when i looked into the camera and saw it . i watched it on television for weeks after the second episode , but i did not watch it anymore . i am not sure why i watched it , but i realized that i liked it . i thought it made me want to see something new and interesting . so here i am watching it .|0
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen year old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.|1
an untidy man , known as bill , lives in a small dreary flat , with a poster of marilyn monroe plastered above the front door . there is one picture i 've been looking for : her long hair hanging over her right shoulder , a white shirt beneath it showing off a nice hourglass figure . she did n't seem to be the sort of girl who spends any amount of time shopping . at least none that i know of . i thought they had a great time together and now look at her . he is very well dressed , obviously not from anywhere , but has probably spent a fortune on his appearance .|0
Barbershop 2: Back in Business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. The movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.|1
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, like I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK since I like to express my own opinions quite frequently. If something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. This gives me yet another chance to take my shots at ""The Departed"". When one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful."|1
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is, then this would be it. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but rather this year alone, I haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far, be it from the West, or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great premise, but poor execution, relying on clichéd techniques (I think these are the only tools of the trade available?)|1
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha. Too many diversions from the actual history. Terrible terrible subtitle!!! I wonder where and who did that subtitle. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was soooo bad! Described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. Honestly, I'm wondering if the film critics of Academy award is that lenient or what?|1
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. Then again, are these really suicides? It seems as though there's a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that, making for a very weird looking specter. Recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit.|1
"Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film ""A Death in Venice. "" Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition."|1
This movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good. It is truly appalling. Its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but alas they were serious. Made for TV, but not worthy of even that. It contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh will he save the town from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I cant explain how bad this is. Awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy.|1
"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as ""the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times"" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is in there too."|1
i am so excited that greek is back ! this season looks really eventful . im glad that casey is coming to stay , although the idea of having to drive him up there for his bachelor party makes me laugh . i guess he gets a lot of attention during the course of the trip . i was n't in the habit of seeing other girls with their girlfriends , but i did try to get a better look at casey since he has no boyfriend . on the one hand , maybe he would rather have a friend over than an actual date .|0
i was a huge fan of this series. Yesterday i watched it again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} & Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. This series shows what good, clean comedy is.If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10.|1
any fan of russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub - par performances phoned - in by mashkov and bodrov jr . the films are not filmed for that reason , but because there is nothing else to see on it . i am disappointed with this one , though no - one has ever told me how long it took to find them . the film was made in 1938 , so there is really a lack of interest in the quality of the movie . the story is simple : they are working on a project to save japan from falling apart and destroy the world ( including the human race ) .|0
i agree with all the comments posted so far : this movie was a waste of time and energy , but it certainly makes up for all the movies that have gone on at other times . the main thing is to do some work here and then see how it plays out . what i ca n't figure out is why the producers of these movies thought they could make something like this film . if you believe in bad actors , it takes more than your imagination to make this movie seem real . this movie is supposed to be funny and exciting .|0
"Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called ""Half Empty."" I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest Sequel, or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies, we go to be entertained  and ""Half Empty"" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it."|1
"As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who, well... are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget. Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films?FBI capture two buddies and send them to ""New Alcatraz,"" where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests.First rate acting all around, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys."|1
i bought this video on a throw - out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as a great musical . that is , if you can find it anywhere , and even if you never do , let 's just say i saw it for myself . i really did like the film . it has an interesting blend of romantic comedy and romance . it had a funny theme , too , but i got the feeling that it was just something that was going to get me off the hook after a while .|0
What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow .|1
"After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of ""Belphégor"" before."|1
What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot.|1
After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these.|1
if you were enjoyed by watching ` ` guinea pig ' ' - then you ' ll like this movie to ! ` ` i am very , very afraid that i have seen too much of ' when it comes time to retire ' . i mean , how many times in the last 50 years did anyone say that life is so unfair ? and do you realize that every one of those things was a mistake ? there is just something about making a movie that you ca n't let go with . it ' s as though the whole thing has been thrown into a garbage truck and pulled off at the end .|0
i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic . it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against their mothers in front of a gym full of people who do n't even remember why they were there the first time around , but it is too predictable for the situation to be anything else . at least , that 's my impression . as you can see , it did have a rather good beginning . the main character was an old man with bad teeth trying to teach his son how to ride a pony . he also had an odd relationship with his father .|0
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like ""Pistolero"", ""Comanche"" and ""The Gent"" I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while ""CC Rider"" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable."|1
"Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a ""run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc"" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.There's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse."|1
"me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the mall , which i thought was so dumb . the movie did not have any fun at all . there are really two people in the movie . it is supposed to be a joke but i can see why it is called "" comedy "" and they do not laugh when they were watching it . the plot is bad enough . but the actors are awful . the movie is very boring , and the story is unfunny , but the acting is horrible ."|0
firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu . i can say with conviction that these three have never been shot at without a great deal more than a handful of shots thrown at them . i found this as hilarious as most of the other film i 've seen , it was not until after the fact that i realised what an embarrassment it is . i ca n't imagine what happens if you allow a gun to go into a person 's head because of the amount of shooting involved in it .|0
this may be the most tension - filled movie i have ever seen . in fact , it ' s so nerve - wracking , i have no idea what they are thinking . i suppose that is probably a compliment to the movie itself - but really , i ' ve had more than enough pain in my life just today . there were about 20 minutes left of the film before i turned it off . i could see it on tv as soon as the credits rolled . i must have dozed off for 5 minutes because i wake up sometime after ten .|0
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure.At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational.|1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.|1
steven seagal is back ! here with his third film released this year . of course as a one time screenplay , i could have made it for an even bigger story . however , i never had any trouble getting my own movie to go on the market . and as you know , i was at the house of usher before the movie started so i did not really need to make it for me . after the initial shock , i started to feel a little nervous and unsure . there were a few reasons why this was wrong . first , the characters were not that great .|0
"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years..."|1
That's all I can really say about this film. It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series. The action is pretty nice in general. The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Pretty good in general, there... The problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff.|1
i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h . p . lovecraft ' s ` ` the lurking fear ' ' that was shot in 1873 ' as if to say , you are not a man who understands horror , or what is expected of me , so why have you kept it from me ? how can i tell my readers about the real monsters in this book ? they know only one thing : no one lives forever . this story is based on an original manuscript and has been produced by many authors . the main problem with this book is that i can not get the proper words into it .|0
as a fan of c . j . ' s earlier movie , latter days , i really wanted to like this film . the characters all seemed so easy to understand and i could n't get over how easily they were able to change . it even reminded me of the movies we read about in the 1940 's . i remember thinking that was a lot of fun . you can hardly see what you are watching but the scenes are so animated that it is difficult to believe that they have changed at all . here is a scene where the protagonist is attacked by a man from the government .|0
"What? - that was it? The town sheriff (John Agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? With instrumentals by The Wildcats, ""Night Fright"" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. Remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb."|1
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, I still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans,and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Medieval times. Lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion.|1
steven segal ' s movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema . i have been tragically bored with every one of my own movies over the past two years . some of the actors are not so bad , but this film was just like any other . i do not have much to recommend it at this point , but what i think really is that it would be more exciting if i had seen it on a bigger screen . i am sure anyone watching this could take it as a little too far , but i still wanted to make sure i did n't get an idea of what it actually was .|0
"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: ""Police Squad - in color"", you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you ever seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry."|1
watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there . let me say , most of the other reviews were good . but for all the work i made in those days , it is not worth it to find out about what you have seen here today . so i think it would be very nice if you would tell me what was going on at least once in a while . how could i ever appreciate such a beautiful movie when i was so busy with my own personal life ? do you have any questions ? well , here 's the first thing that came out of your mouth .|0
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ""gem."" This one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on VHS from an arcade on 42nd st. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. But, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse film. This film could replace water-boarding as a humane method of interrogation. No, I take that back - I would prefer water-boarding."|1
i found this movie to be a big disappointment , especially considering the cast . the characters are not believable . the character is extremely difficult to get close to . you will find out why in time . just watch this film for yourself . it is probably the most boring one we ever made and i can hardly believe that anyone would want to go to any trouble to see this movie . there was a lot more than just an outline of scenes where the leading lady gets all flustered . there were lots of twists and turns , some very unfunny , and i have no idea how to describe them .|0
eve is an eye opener , because of the great sceneries and the tech - no music in the backgrounds , we have to write a couple of words about it . however , as far as i know , she is a good artist and can make her own mistakes . this movie has not been written yet . that is why there is so much drama involved in the original film , but i guess i just never get enough of it . if you could see this movie after watching it at night , you would not believe how bad it is !|0
i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it . it was one of those movies where a bunch of teenagers go in and start shooting people like they are cattle , except for the part that is going to cause a whole lot of trouble . if i was you i would have stayed in bed , or at least rolled over , or tried to sleep . there are other ways to get up early ( like walking around the campus in the middle of the night , or driving around the city with a guy who has a girlfriend ) .|0
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That's reason enough for me.She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. And said parties becoming drunken orgies.All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. And Emanuelle beds most of them.Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this one. He just ripped it off and used the same cast(s).|1
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).|1
Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. The actor i liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.Plot is a little uneven, about Lt.|1
"unfortunately a boring flick , and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg public domain version . i could see him on the screen , standing up , saying something like "" this is just so ridiculous ! what the f * * k ever happened to this movie ? where does this happen ? "" or "" why am i not surprised that they are trying to kill you all right ? "" but i think it would make a lot of sense for me to be shocked at one point in my life , when i first found out about the movies ."|0
this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending ( or maybe a crying game at least ) , but if it were to die out , we 'd have had to stop . the film is not even good enough to catch my attention . i ca n't imagine how the characters are going to know the plot and what they are supposed to be doing , but who knows what has been going on all these years . it does not help that there is an awkward moment where one man just asks his wife if she would like to go into the forest and find a beautiful place to live .|0
i love this movie ! ! ! this beautiful , charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable simplicity . it has a lot of wonderful twists and turns , such as playing the role of the girl who loved the star and being a hero . this movie is so much fun to watch ! however , the more i watched it , the more i grew concerned . it was like watching two people who could barely talk . every word out of their mouths - and that 's saying something ! - was funny and funny .|0
this was an interesting movie . i could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - ewwww , that film is bad ! i would not want to be part of a horror film or anything like that again . so why should it be different ? because i think you can get a lot more action if you keep watching the same tv shows over and over again . when you do n't know how much longer it 's going to take to make a sequel then you may want to find something else to watch . i 'm just trying to get the basic premise right before i go to sleep .|0
i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies . the more bizarre and imaginative the film , the worse it gets . this movie is nothing like what i had hoped to watch last night . instead of being full of fun comedies ( although i guess there is an ' in ' when you think about something like that ) , it was just as annoying and depressing as before . i feel like they are telling me to put my heart back into my body , but i ca n't quite figure out how to do so .|0
I can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much. Well, I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan. While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man!|1
( spoilers more than likely . . . nothing really important you could n ' t have figured out yourselves ) yeah , it was a pretty long shot . . . one of my biggest fears was that the entire movie would be made up in a matter of minutes . and if this is the worst movie i ever saw then what else could it possibly be about ? well not bad - very good , even - but there is no other description to describe how awful it was . it seemed to have happened while i was watching the film .|0
if you ' re looking for an accurate portrayal of che guevara , the cuban revolutionary who helped aid fidel castro during the first world war , this is the man . don ' t be fooled into thinking that you are in love with him . i do not know what was in your mind when you agreed to come with me . you were just a young innocent girl having a bad crush on a boy . it has been over twenty years since you last saw him . his death would have been much harder to bear had he not been there to guide you out of it .|0
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as I could but this one I felt was so below par not only for Hitch's films - aw heck, I'm being far too nice here. This pictured really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carole Lombard, but I have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey.|1
This was a nice film. It had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. The storyline kinda reminded me of The City of God. But this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. It had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south Africa. The actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked Estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable.|1
pot - seeking pre - teen joshua miller ( as tim ) throws his sister ' s doll into the river while daniel roebuck ( as david ) sits down and watches . it ' s not very funny , but all of a sudden i feel really bad for these guys , especially daniel roebuck . he has just lost his sister in a tragic accident that was supposed to have been his fault . they ' re going to stay in touch with each other ? what the hell ! i ' m going to lose some money over this ! well , i can ' t do that .|0
i find this film meretricious , tentative , lethargic , and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid . however , in this instance it was a good enough shot to get me off my guard for a moment . i was not looking forward to the evening , but i did enjoy watching it and saw nothing else so far as the film . i decided to look back at the first few chapters and read through them all . i had a feeling there were some similarities in the scenes , but i still found it strange that the characters who were doing this movie appeared to be more character than actual person .|0
"This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of ""extras"" delivering a film that turned out to be ""okey dokey"".Kermit's melancholy ukulele number ""Rainbow Connection"" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was beat out by Norma Rae's ""It Goes Like It Goes"". I'll pick Kermit's song any day!"|1

Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it.|1

This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie.|1
sometimes there ' s a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe . this is one of those movies you like to watch the most , i can ' t say what genre it ' s on , but i believe it ' s one of the good ones that ' s never been released . well , i know i don ' t have to tell you all about the worst show of my life , because i didn ' t look forward to seeing it with my two roommates and some of the others .|0
"Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a ""forbidden"" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding."|1
Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed.The plot centres around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. In order to do so, he teams up with a clan of Ninjas, led by three masters  gold lamé ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants.|1
i expected a lot more out of this film . the preview looked interesting so i decided to check it out . first off , you will have to look at the plot : the story ' s all in chinese characters , and the dialogue is strange . the narrator ' s description is odd ; the style is different than the way it usually was , so it ' s hard to find any similarities to the original versions . but there are no similarities that can be seen in any of the other movies either , only the same parts .|0
man , what an awful film . as with many terrible films , the structure of its awfulness lies in the way it seems to have a negative connotation when viewed by any and all people who were not present . there is nothing inherently evil about the movie ( though it has a very bad ending ) but i just ca n't understand why someone would choose to turn out the lights at the beginning of something that could potentially be so bad . if only one person on the planet wanted to go to the cinema , they could have been able to see it .|0
Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- I particularly like the two doofuses playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very feckless and yet sinister. Some might gripe about the need for a strong Ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward hits the proper nuances. Amazing. Simply Amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times I've watched it.|1

it carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of vietnam and into the wild - eyed look of an american soldier who wants his comrades ' brains to be removed from their heads . no doubt the stories have some kind of meaning . as a historian , i could n't help myself . the first part is not for me to read , but for the movie . i thought at first that i was reading wrong because the main characters were more in - depth than most people would want to tell the story .|0

"Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.On this ""Turkish"" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely Hollywoodish to me), Altioklar is trying to be some sort of Tarantino."|1

Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? That's not funny, that's just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.|1
like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure , the image of the cranes that are trying to escape from the water were all but abandoned on the spot . i 'm not sure what kind of movies these people would like to see if they did n't get to watch this film . the first thing that caught my interest was the idea that maybe there is still a way we can stop this thing from happening . or maybe it only has one reality , the real one . after all , i really do not know why i am looking at pictures of the island in australia .|0
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable.|1
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco's powerful message. The film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people.|1
This movie was a major bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well.......I think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors.|1
I saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and I didn't know where it had come from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here at IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is great, I believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. And the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining.|1
"honestly , i do n ' t really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show . it embraces the idea of a man being involved with an african american woman .

"" "" i would like to point out that this show has never been made into a reality tv series ."|0
this has got to be the most god - awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched . it makes mel laugh , and when she sees what is coming next , she tries to put her hands over her ears to stop the sound . i feel sorry for her . i do n't blame her for trying to save my life . that was a terrible day . after that , i fell into a dreamless sleep . if anyone could make me fall into a deep well of despair , it would be sean . i mean , he 's so good - looking and charming .|0
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. The issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).I also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable.|1
i have not seen and heard the original version . i am no russian , but i am learning right now . i also had the pleasure of writing a novel about an american and his girlfriend who live in florida . this was my first one of these when i was 19 years old . there was no movie or movie about the film being made . it was always a big surprise for me to get out of bed at the start of the week and actually read the book . i liked the title though . it sounded so romantic .|0
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the Old West. Except it's not the real Old West, of course. It's some sort of Future West, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them.So, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies.|1
"""Hood Rat"" is absolutely terrible. This is a urban version of ""Willard"". I just can't believe this movie got made, let alone distributed. Someone in Universal Studios thought that people would watch and like this ""movie"". The only good thing in this is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. The one thing I hate in movies is sped up action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Every scene transition is some fast motion special effect. The director should be banned from making movies forever."|1
` ` black vengeance ' ' is an alternate title for ` ` ying hung ho hon ' ' aka ` ` tragic hero ' ' ( i do ) . the story goes on to tell of a boy who has no idea that his mother and he are about to go down with a train . it 's so bad , you 'd think somebody would see this coming . at first they did but after a while things started to get interesting . two young men in uniform came up to them and invited them to stay at their house in norfolk for the night .|0
there was n ' t much thought put into the story line on many fronts . this is a good action movie , just as bad as the one in which we watched it before . if you want to see the sequel ( no pun intended ! ) you may want to watch the first episode where they get abducted and have to find their way home with an alien who claims to be related to the aliens by his own skin . if you do not watch this for yourself , i can only say that it is a truly shitty movie .|0
Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. When jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her.|1
i am sorry to rain on everybody ' s parade . just a little background about me : i like and respect my job but not much . i have worked in the same industry for 25 years , but never had to see this movie as it has been so far out of print that i do n't even really know how many hours you can sleep through . i have seen quite a lot of film films at my age , but this one showed me a lot worse than anything i had ever seen in my life . it was probably the best movie i had ever seen or thought i would watch .|0
it ' s true , no one really expects anything from sequels . but even by that low standard this is not as bad as i had hoped it would be . it just doesn ' t add up to an overall horror film . the first two scenes are extremely predictable . there is nothing much worth writing out and in the middle of them , there ' s a dead man on the stage who falls asleep before he kills anyone . the plot is very simple . you can ' t expect to know all the plots or what they look like .|0
this was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea . . however , it was just a little odd to watch that particular movie with my parents . why did we get in the car with them ? i mean they could n't have been nicer if they had invited us along on a cruise ! no matter how many times i tried to see one of those horrible movies , i failed . there is no point in watching a terrible movie about the bad guys . there are enough bad guys at the party that i really doubt any of them would help us .|0
another great musical from hollywoods golden age ! i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are going out together and they meet up after their first date with someone they never met . as a matter of fact , it was not that far - fetched but it made me see why my friends were attracted to each other . in fact , i had to watch this because i am the only one with an interest in watching such a wonderful film . the main character is a girl named amy whom he falls in love with ; she has two sisters who are very pretty .|0
for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing . all the acting was very well done and the story of the crime was fairly simple . i felt that it was not important in any way , yet i have to admit that it was nice . there were lots of great scenes . some of the director has great taste . so much so that it is almost as if he made it his personal mission to set people on fire at least several times . i can not see how someone could watch such a boring film and actually enjoy it . i feel that the plot is rather dull .|0
this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . its attempts to parody various sports movies are half - baked and half - hearted , but it succeeds so far in making a decent film about something else altogether . however , we have had enough of those shows for one night . let 's go to the cinema and watch an adult comedy . i hope you will get on with the movie . here are some reviews of this film . please enjoy it . the characters are all very nice , but they also really are a waste of time .|0
"This self-important, confusing b+w ""film"" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. There's no room for plot when you've got ""visceral imagery"" and ""subtle"" allegory. To me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades."|1
i love this movie . it is the first film master p have ever done . it is based on this movie . for the next two weeks he will sit there alone with a large bottle of cheap wine , watching the television show all day and thinking about what a stupid movie it is . when he realizes that this is a very dumb movie , he gets pissed off . then he starts to cry because he can not believe in this movie . after a couple more nights of being bored , he starts spending time with the rest of the band .|0
"I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I wondered to myself, ""Why have I never heard of this movie?"" Then I turned over the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters."|1
i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically . anyone who calls this ' the movie ' just can not believe how silly it is . it is not very original at all . and as far as making fun of this movie , i really ca n't say you would be able to get anything in this movie that makes any of this funny . it is quite pathetic really . if you are looking for something more interesting than that movie , let me tell you about the last film i had or saw that could have made it worth seeing .|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title ""The Broken Skull."" Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, ""Evil Dead"" kind of way.Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying ""hunh?"|1
tediously long dreary cinematic waffle . i could n ' t believe how bad this film was . i watched it merely as a waste of time and money but i was very disappointed with the ending . i did not get a good look into the story , even though i don ' t know what it is to watch an awful horror movie that has only been released for a few weeks . however , i guess if you were going to watch this one ( at least it will be fun to watch something that plays out like this ) , you wouldn ' t want to miss anything .|0
i seen this movie when it came out . i thought what an average movie . i have now realized i never saw one of them , and the only thing that i did see was a couple of movies with people dancing around in red plastic chairs . this is just plain weird . there are no lines or plot lines which could have been made up . it does not make any sense at all . i have never seen a movie like this ; i have read a few books and seen some movies where they do a lot of acting to get people to pay attention to the movie .|0
I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form.|1
i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal - mart in the bargain bin for $ 5 . 50 , so i think i may have paid $ 25 , 000 to get this movie . why did n't i see that ? i thought i had been too busy trying to figure out how to save my money . but then i saw the whole thing in a movie ! it looked like a nice movie . even if it were based on reality , who would care what it really is ? and when you come back from the dead , you can actually read about it in new york times .|0
so , this is the worst movie you will probably ever see . it ' s up there with ` ` crossbones ' . i ' m surprised you did n't know that in your own youth ! i ' ll bet you don ' t have anything against it at all ! you ' ll probably laugh and cry if you get a taste of it . i hope you love this film . my mom thinks it ' s a waste of time but i ' ll make it up as i go along when i ' ve been watching it .|0
"I really liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good level-design, interesting and clever enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I am not by default against movie spin-offs of games. I thought ""DOOM The Movie"" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll has done here, is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible (well not the length, the movie runs only a merciful 90 min) The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement."|1
MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc. ), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture.|1
to paraphrase thora birch : ` ` i kind of like this movie . it ' s the exact opposite of everything that is supposed to be exciting about television . i was just trying to think of what would have happened if i had watched it as a kid . well , maybe not even that much scary . the movie itself was pretty awful , but i ' m not in love with it because it didn ' t make much sense . anyway , the plot was basically a bunch of stupid people chasing after each other . the characters were so stupid and inane that nobody really cared what the actors were saying .|0
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow.The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: So if Starbuck thinks she knows where Earth is why not send her out in a Raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust.|1
"I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and ""perfect"". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film."|1
"""Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of ""nanny""."|1
i normally do n ' t like romantic films , but i love this film very much . the story is really pretty in the end and it 's so funny that one of the funniest moments ever comes along on this show . i know you will be interested to read the first episode of the movie and what we find here is interesting . i have just been given a tour of my hometown for the first time ; the town is such a mess with most of the businesses closed or deserted . there was only one road that went into town during the day which was n't used very much .|0
stay far away from this film . the fact that you ' re reading reviews tells me you may have already heard this movie , however i will take a look at this film to verify if you are interested in viewing it . my name is tim mcnichol and i am one of the leading directors . i ' m sorry to disappoint but i ' m very disappointed that i missed this movie on such short notice . i like all of the characters , i ' m happy to watch every one of them as long as they do not try to mess up my character line .|0
"Anyone that is looking for an episode of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI"" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.A murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently."|1
Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders.|1
"I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says ""I miss Elizabeth but I ache for Grace"". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!!"|1
The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons!|1
i was at the premier of the movie last night in rome . i am not an expert in the art of film making because i do not believe it is necessary for me to , but my initial reaction was to have a huge laugh when the plot was revealed and i had no idea how things were going to get out of control . on top of this i was watching a movie that was just too bizarre . i was shocked when they told me about the death of some man who lived here in the hollywood hills and he died in 1971 with his wife .|0
Except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was patronizing and convoluted. Without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note.|1
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb.|1
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut's between important parts. And leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all.|1
previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film ' s plot details than i could . what do you make of this movie , and what have you missed ? it is not at all what i had hoped for . it lacks the impact of a historical comedy . in any case , i do n't think it will be very interesting to read . as far as i know , i have never seen an italian film before . this was one of those films that made me question why i even liked it so much .|0
I was sorely disappointed in this movie. Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. The movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.Dutcher's God's Army One was okay.|1
"Before we start, may I say I hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. Why? Because, after I'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' had appeared on the screen. So don't say you weren't warned.Fred Sears might have directed ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks""), but ""The Giant Claw"" is not that giant a film."|1
this is one of my three all - time favorite movies . my only quibble is that the director , peter yates , has been given the option of watching it . i am a fan of the film so i would not have to see what is going to happen after it begins . unfortunately , i never get to see what is going to happen on the other side . i hope i will enjoy it again soon . please feel free to leave a review on goodreads or on your website for free reviews and / or recommendations . if you liked the movie i would really appreciate if you would leave a review .|0
"No blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.The acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of ""Nanny"", to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own ""Halfway"" house."|1
perhaps i missed something , but i found goya ' s ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama . as to the ghost , i believe there is a great deal more to the story than what is told in any other genre of film . even if the director doesn ' t care for this movie , i don ' t think that he cares enough to pay much attention to anything except his own selfish desire to get rich . at the beginning of the movie , they are able to find ways to have their way in the plot and take some of the fun out of the scene .|0
"If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli ""Okkadu"" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of ""Okkadu"" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end."|1
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot.|1
"Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and ""funny"" a show can be. Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were insufferable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this)."|1
"Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever. This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons."|1
So, you wanna be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or you're REALLY into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes.|1
This movie has an outstanding acting, by Marilia Pêra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. The children weren't actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it does happen till today.|1
We all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. But Raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless Carnosaur series, does not even ATTEMPT to have any enjoyment in it. Its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. Where do we start? Well... the sets are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages.|1
i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life , i can not even fathom how it ends . however , i 'm sure you would find it more interesting if you were n't such an ass - kicker and could give a shit about the film . i just wanted to let you know that i ' m really sorry about what happened to your car . i honestly did not care for the story , but i was trying to be a good friend . i never meant to get you hurt , but i guess i made the mistake of opening my mouth too far .|0
i went to see this movie at a book signing in lexington , ky last night . after a wonderful review , it was perfect to stay out until after the movie . i could feel the mood of the movie changing with each character being mentioned in this story . my eyes started to glaze over . i looked at the clock and noticed it was almost six . there was not much time left . i would have to go back to my office and watch another scene . i had never seen anyone look so worn down . i decided to go home to change .|0
"Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa.I saw this movie, waaay back when I was eight, in 1996. Back then, CGI films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. Also, back then we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, I've held reaally fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is clearly a robot."|1
it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv . i only wish i could take the time to enjoy it myself , but it is a horrible movie . it was so bad in my first year at school that i ended up getting into a lot of trouble with the girls . when you get your first film from someone who does not make a living by being a good actor , you learn to appreciate the good quality acting . i just ca nt understand why people who spend money on something as expensive as this would need to buy it .|0
Piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. It starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest. For all I know it could be Florida. At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith, who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light.|1
...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no thread to follow. I guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky.Not much more to say, really.|1
awful star wars knock - off with a slightly more comic tinge . robert urich stars as the leader of a group of men that have no idea who they are or where they are going . his name is david , so he really did get it right . this movie is based on him trying to help other people in various situations and find ways to make up for their mistakes . some of the actors ' names are quite funny , you can say that because they are all pretty good . what a waste of money ! it 's one of the most useless films ever made .|0
"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated ""Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)."""|1
well , that was sure a waste of dave mckean ' s talents , was n ' t it ? do n ' t get me wrong , i liked the guy , but he was one of the greatest guys i had ever met ! and as far as movies went , this one was awful . the actors were just as terrible as the audience , with bad lighting , bad scenery and no acting whatsoever . they did n't have the same talent as the other actors , although i guess there is more to show here .|0
watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good horror movie . as soon as i heard about it my heart almost leaped out of my chest . how could this be happening to me ? all of these other film titles have shown that they are not really what we were looking for . and then there is james hendrasen , but he seems to be doing an excellent job of making this movie better , if not better than any of the other movies i 've seen in the past few years .|0
there are two things that i noticed in this film . ( this is not a spoiler , just a comment on the movie and an attempt to make me laugh . ) at the conclusion of the film , it was about a man who had some problems in his life . he never had very much money , and when he did , they were usually pretty high . as you can see , he ' s been in the army for several years , but he doesn ' t have a family to go home to during the holidays . instead , he lives in a small town in south dakota .|0
my two daughters ( ages 11 and 13 ) and i were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie which was based on a bad comedy . in truth , it was one of the biggest horror flicks i have ever watched . i remember watching this movie when i graduated from high school . i am sure it would have made more sense for me to just get a job or even work part time but there is no chance in hell that i would find any kind of job that would keep me from getting old .|0
rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion . what makes this film so unsettling is that the characters do not have much to say about the plot , but in a few seconds the actors begin to become lost in a scene where everything goes horribly wrong and they end up dead . the most interesting aspect about this movie is how bad things got . i mean it was bad enough as it was , but this film should be worse . the only reason i ca n't see any comedy at all today is because some of these people actually look funny in the film .|0
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (! ), but KvC ain't quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there.|1
some of the secondary actors try , really hard . and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely . ' he had been so engrossed with the film this time it took him a bit longer to absorb the rest of the speech , his eyes were half - closed from the sun and his ears were numb . but he could have done with a cup of beer . as soon as the last character came up on the screen i turned to face them . they were very excited about how the film should be played .|0
mr . bean has always been my favorite . no matte how many times you watch the same thing , the same one , the same number of different movies . but then there 's a big difference between doing it at home with me and watching it on your own . i do n't understand why i had to watch that movie because i did n't know what the theme was for this movie . if you liked this , go to see it in new york when you 're bored . i mean seriously . this movie is more like a horror film .|0
"i do n ' t know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in , but if you were to go over to their homes and ask a bunch of people around to watch the show , they would just say "" oh , no , that 's boring "" or something like that . well , it turns out that this movie really is very old school ; the actors seem to enjoy it as much as anyone else . the main theme is : we must have had better taste when we started this film than we did when we first made it ."|0
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. There are petty crooks, political prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army plus some dangerous criminals.They are thrown into battle ill-equipped, untrained and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure.The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting.I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing.|1
Being a former MST3k watcher, even I found this movie unwatchable. The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow--they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a couple of bucks and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent pieces of film-making I've ever seen and that's saying something.|1
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. Actually, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. It isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.The story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent.|1
The girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. What I'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. Lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. And if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: They are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion.|1
shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids , this movie centers around some freak named jack . they call him an ' artist ' - who ? that would be cool ! but the problem is that his paintings show he is not very good at art . i really think it is more accurate to describe how he is doing . he just doesn ' t know how to act like someone else or even how to express himself . there is a lot of stuff wrong with this movie and everything that goes on afterwards .|0
so many of us who are devoted to the ` ` art ' ' of the motion picture will disregard or forget the concept , but i can not . this is an act of injustices in my time . why should they give a crap about it when it has nothing to do with any real substance at all ? i just like to see how that compares . i have seen a lot of good movies recently , but these were pretty stupid . and i saw no reason to think the movie was better than what i thought it would be .|0
jurassic park iii * _ _ _ adventure sam nell ( the dish ) , william macy ( happy texas , fargo . it is also very hard for a writer to write down a story that they really did n't want to play at . however , let me say that i have my moments when i think that this is going to be a good first book . perhaps i should just leave this movie as i can see no other way . anyway , if you would like to review the script please consider an attempt on the person who has been watching the screenplay .|0
"it was 1983 and i was 13 . i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were at the movies . there were some strange things going on , i could not take my eyes off of her . she kept looking over at me like she just saw something funny . so i got up to help her with the movie . "" "" then what happened ? "" paul asked . 
 "" after i helped her pick out the movie , i took her hand and we walked in the direction of the beach house . we walked about fifteen yards before a dog started barking right in front of us ."|0
I thought this was a great action flick. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. It got me thinking, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking butt. I just hope to see Geena in another film soon. Seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long.|1
being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary , i was eager to find out what was going on that would make this movie so entertaining . i just wanted to see it because i thought i had seen enough of these movies to last me for awhile , but then again i did n't know much about tv or acting . however , after watching this movie my curiosity got the better of me and i started asking around . the director was very good and he gave me quite a detailed description of the plot and characters .|0
Apparently this movie was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminded me of how when I see that someone has been murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I move on. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point?|1
I've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. When a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress playing Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it.|1
there are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few . let me start with a little comedy in which a protagonist who gets kidnapped or killed is forced to kill several innocent people during his escape . the plot is fairly boring and you can see why the title of the movie is so good . however , since i am an expert on medieval - style medieval film production i had to look up some parts of this book and get them based on what was actually done here .|0
i think trash really sucks . i watched it a couple of weeks ago and i have n ' t seen that one in a year . it 's actually quite funny . the only thing i can see is that it looks like garbage . you know , maybe this movie will end up with my name on it . do you think i am crazy ? i really hate to admit it , but when i saw this movie , i was shocked at how many people seemed to want to talk to the audience . the whole show just made me so uncomfortable i thought i might vomit .|0
wow , did this episode start on a stooooopid premise ! the enterprise is chugging along when all of the lights go out ! this is a movie that i saw once on the radio . i knew it would be better in person . i had been so worried about seeing my dad and his new girlfriend again that i have completely forgotten to bring any of my own movies home . i do not know where they even are in this world . how can i possibly use this film to get away with taking part in something this stupid ?|0
"ok . . . . so , by minute 15 in the film , there ' s still no dialogue . this film arrived to me after i left it a day ago ; i didn ' t even notice it coming into my head . i was only in it because i wanted to see some action and got caught off guard , but then i remember that it was supposed to be a surprise . "" don ' t take this any further , don ' t take it any further ! please do not take it any further ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"|0
"this movie was obviously made with a very low budget , but did they have to make it so obvious ? ! ! "" what are you talking about ? ! i do n't understand any of this ! "" i asked in disgust . i sat down on my bed . the television was off and there was even a film in the ' s ' . i looked over at the tv for the first time since waking up . the screen showed a bunch of kids playing soccer . there was a big crowd of adults and kids that were yelling and making sounds ."|0
Irvine Welsh's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh, all with a few of Welsh's trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.|1
this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv . i own all 9 seasons on television . what a crock ! this is not the first time i have been here and watched this film before . i just hope the script is good and the characters are real . i hate this part for some reason . i really want it to be over so i can get away from here . but i am stuck . if you want to see this movie , or even watch it , you need to get an idea of who is in control here .|0
golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there . a sexy comedy , this one was much more funny than the real thing . as i read the play i started feeling sick . i tried to pay attention and try to think of why it would be funny . that 's all i ever did while acting . i had a few moments of panic on the way to the theatre but i quickly got used to the character . when i first came to the scene i really felt sorry for the actors but they just looked so sad .|0
this was a random rental at the video store . but i was impressed from the start . wooden camera and tripod were one of the few pieces of film i had ever seen . the quality was just about right . if it could have done a better job , i 'd have been able to take a picture of what i was thinking when i first saw it . it 's a sad story that makes people wonder how someone can live in this country without having seen or read all of the movies they watch . however , it has proven useful since my friend bob is currently writing a book on the subject .|0
this really is by far the worst movie i ' ve ever seen in my whole life ( i ' m approaching about as close to the real thing as a man can be . but it ' s worth it to watch this movie ; i ' ll admit that it doesn ' t have a lot of humor at its best , and you know what else ? it ' s the most absurd one i have ever seen ! there ' s nothing amusing about this movie . i think i just wanted to see this movie because i found it too funny to look at again .|0
this movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made . it is a story told in a steady , positive way and has been shown countless times over the last three years which i think would be impressive if it was n't based on a bunch of old cliché crap . it is completely lacking in character . the whole plot is boring . the only thing that really catches your attention is the man who lives next to him . as he sits in his car he is staring straight ahead , ignoring all the other kids playing with their toys . his eyes are turned away from the tv .|0
i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick . the shonky production values at the end of this movie are almost as bad as the ones in the first part . but if you want to watch any of this , then you have to watch this episode . it does not exactly fit the bill of good movies , but there is one thing that makes it great . the characters never do anything remotely similar to the films and the plot goes nowhere with them . it is really too bad that they are so far gone and will never re - emerge again .|0
"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. This movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. Steve's rendition of a dying cat during his ""I love what I know"" serenade had me vomiting for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying. ""You messin' wit private stock."""|1
I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was.|1
in the twilight years of his career , charles bronson forged long - running partnerships with several directors , most notably j . for the first half hour or so , we talked about film and acting , and what we were going to spend our money on . he always had a plan . he was never one to go out and buy anything that i would have described as cheap , but this movie took me by surprise . how could an actor possibly come up with something like this after only seeing it a few times ?|0
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, Don (William Hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish.|1
"A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in ""Double Indemnity,"" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher."|1
"Not a box office success; no-one really knows why. It may have failed simply because of its title. It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Hard Weapon"", ""Die Lethal"", etc. - talking about ""the long kiss goodnight"" will get you nowhere. But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie. A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on."|1
"the first time i saw this was when i was with a date , and she thought it was an awful joke . i felt sad because it actually was n't funny at all in that way , but it is funny on a much larger scale for people who know about movies . this movie was probably made in germany by the nazis , where it featured some of their most notorious "" crime fighters "" . what i heard from one of my friends and co - stars came across as something out of a sci - fi film , but i knew better ."|0
this is a new barbie movie . the graphics were really good . they made the movie seem partially realistic . i like to watch this movie when i 'm in college and i like to see how it happens . it has a lot of interesting characters who come together to make the movie even more entertaining . if you want me to tell you all about this , i will . i would suggest that you keep your mouth shut about this for the rest of the film so that you can get an early start tomorrow .|0
hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie ! ? ! ? although i have n ' t seen any of this kind of thing in a while it is pretty impressive . i ca nt help but think there are more movies like this than just the one that made me want to go into this video , and i could actually understand why people thought this was good . this film is bad enough without having to watch it . it is so depressing . no one seems to be watching it . as for the plot , i am not impressed at all with how it came about .|0
Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that David was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts.|1
first i got ta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code . sure , there were some decent comedies but not many great ones . i 'm a real fan of james bond films . my mom used to sit with me every day and watch them as she always did . it would be nice if your mother was watching those movies like she usually does . i am an adult , i know that i should be able to have a parent watch these movies so i just do n't see what can be done with it . besides , no one likes the movie .|0
First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie. 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven.|1
this is a tough film to review , since several factors need to be taken into account . let ' s see if i can figure out what they really are ! the first thing i ' ve learned from this film has been that we have to follow our own rules , and not allow ourselves to be corrupted as well . it ' s hard to understand how anyone or anything could become a victim of something that does absolutely no good . it ' s like watching a movie in which everyone else is acting perfectly . you can see them , but nothing happens .|0
strange , often effective hippie zombie flick , starring the unforgettable husband / wife team of alan and anya ornsby , this very same movie . the plot was good , the characters were well - known , and i like to think this was a good story , although i am disappointed in myself for not seeing something about this character that would give us some clues as to why he or she would have become a zombie . there is definitely something fishy going on , but i guess there is n't any time to find out if it has anything to do with zombies right now .|0
Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence.|1
went to the preview engagement of ` ` grand champion ' ' today ( dallas / fort worth , austin , snyder and a bunch of other towns where you ca n't find all the right phrases ) . there were just too many questions : ' what is this supposed to be about ? why is this movie so awful ? it seems like the most fun movie ever made in hollywood . i think some of the people who work with me for the film have gotten their own plot and feel like they 've got the upper hand when it comes to the big show .|0
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that).|1
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old.|1
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) FX was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. As is typical with these D movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. Hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really really big step down from Babylon 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' It was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also.|1
All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, I really do. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. But this was hardly even funny...I mean, I guess it was, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks...terrible. And the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13.|1
i must say , when i saw this film at a 6 . 5 on this site , i figured it was too good to be true , so i went back for a look . well , i mean , i was standing in the middle of this room , surrounded by people who were acting out an action movie that they had been watching before , and then there came a knock at the door leading to the stage . it took me several seconds to realize it was not a person knocking , but a man .|0
this movie had very few moments of real drama . after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral of doom . i have always been an emotional person , but i can hardly believe that this is not a movie made in the 1930s or ' 08 . it just gives you the feeling that you are on the wrong side of a guillotine and that some kind of cosmic joke is afoot . i ca n't believe that this will ever be over . there is absolutely no sign of anything happening and yet i feel that the whole movie was horribly boring .|0
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps to himself. He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes.|1
this is one of the better feel - good films of 1999 with kate capshaw leading an all - star cast about a small child who loses his mother . the film is extremely well known but i do n't have any idea what it was made for or if anyone else would care . also , i ca n't tell you why i think they were in it . i really do n't like this movie and i want to get my hands on some of the film . however , i can only assume that there are many other films similar to this one as well .|0
` ` rififi ' ' is a terrific heist movie , and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since . this story was based on the film in which it is shown that all the characters were just acting out their parts in a staged way . so they were obviously not actors at all - they were just people who could be read by others . i saw this movie several times over the last few years , and never quite understood how the script worked . it looked more like someone playing a game than an actual movie .|0
"This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the head-banging music this movie revolved around. Chris/Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME!! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery. The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride."|1
jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs . cobra . no guesswork here . a giant cgi has been created in 1910 to build a bunker for the enemy . it is obviously going to take another year to get that bunker back up on its feet , but i ' m beginning to wonder if there is anything at all left of it after being blown to smithereens during the early 1990s and 1950s . what about the two - dimensional images of a movie scene ? they look like the same movies we were expecting when we first viewed the set .|0
"despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi , this film does a lot to get me laughing . you can call it "" comedy of errors "" for one . the plot is bad . there are not that many scenes to describe but i will say that this is the first time i have seen such a low budget horror movie ever . even the characters look like they were out of place in the middle ages . the lighting is terrible . it could have easily been shown in a different frame of mind ."|0
surprisingly good and quick - witted adventure that features kelsey grammer ( supposedly in his first lead role in a feature ) . on top of this novel , the story is fantastic . the author does n't waste time talking , he just lets it flow . he is one of those people who do what they want to do and not think twice about it . but i can see how bad the story would be if it really did end up with her dead sister . at least when you put it into an episode , it will be worth watching for a while .|0
'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different portrayals of the characters, but in this one, they are simply hopelessly in love.) The film is pretty slow-moving in some places, but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well.|1
this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series . i did not even get a chance to try it because my wife was busy taking care of some stuff so she could be home at bedtime and would be happy to watch it with us . but i really like these movies and enjoyed them . i also enjoyed watching the action films which are good enough to make you want to go into the movie room , where you can see what you want to see if you look at the camera from the very back .|0
i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about as much fun as anything else you could have seen . but that does n't mean i am in love with the movie . the main reason i chose to watch the movie is to see some of the very popular films . most of the ones i actually liked were quite boring . when i saw this one i thought maybe i would not get into the movie until later so i really did not want to watch it after all .|0
Great book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude.|1
"I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. No one else was at all memorable. I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child. I even think I had a plastic ""Seaview"" that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub. Long time ago.As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards."|1
"""Admissions"" is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make her overworked mother not notice, she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the acting is first-rate especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put in great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the ending."|1
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash. The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly.Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it. First off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot. It cranks everything up and just goes. Next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat.|1
Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs.|1
We get to see who the good guys are. The union. And who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. This is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. The plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. It's boring and pointless.|1
"i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out . they showed clips every day of this film and then in the early hours , while i was asleep . "" "" how do you know if it 's good or not ? "" she asked , trying to sound as casual as possible . 
 "" because i 'm a very good movie critic and i can see what they are doing here . "" he said proudly . 
 "" so why have you been acting on this ? "" she asked suspiciously . 
 "" well , i just thought you would like this film better . """|0
"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the ""rest of the world"". Story based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during WWII was the prisoner of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps. Borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter Tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. He describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation."|1
I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!|1
"This is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word ""credit"" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman."|1
this was touted as a sequel to crash dive , which was a very good film in the low budget of all the films i have witnessed . it has an excellent dialogue and is much better than its counterpart . you may be surprised at how well - written or well - written this book actually is . i can only think of two people who will find this hard to believe . for example : tony carradine and gary campbell . they spent hours going through their list of bad movies to find the best comedic comedies . so they agreed to stay in the basement of the house and work on a few new ones .|0
the reason why this movie sucks , have these people even read a bible ? everything in the movie was so boring , no matter what it was about . you would think after watching that i would get bored with it , but i really wanted to see how it could be written . this movie did not go well at all . every word and action scene is like trying to write a book with your eyes open . i tried my best but could n't keep from getting excited at the prospect of reading something like this . when we arrived back at our room , alex took his time getting out of the car .|0
i go this game and it is alright i guess . i just expected a bit more . the main difference is that these people do not know they are dead , so they are very good at making us think they are going to pass on the information about themselves . i would like to take you out today but we need to look for an hour of relaxation before we try this show . i want to see what everyone has been doing in here since we last saw it . most of them seem to be enjoying themselves and the show as much as i do .|0
i ' m a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one . i find it very hard to understand how an intelligent human could put up with this kind of nonsense . however , the point is that everyone understands that zombies are not stupid . what they ' re truly dumb about are their personalities . when i was in middle school i went out to meet my brother . we had been friends for about two years and i liked him as a fellow jock . he was very good looking and had his hair dyed dark brown .|0
"Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak). The ""cold-turkey"" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from Saul Bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein."|1
` ` the racketeer ' ' stars carol ( deprived of the ` ` e ' ' that usually appeared at the end of the novel ) , it made me want to write for real . i spent an hour each morning working out every aspect of my book in a split second so i could get into the main plot line . i was very excited when i finally saw the first two titles and then decided that i might have to re - see the film later . you do n't get to go through this movie unless you can come back to the beginning and discover the whole plot .|0
one of the best sitcoms to run on indian television along with dekh bhai dekh and idhar udhar . great . i really want to watch this movie . what a waste of time ! why do n't you start off slow , and then move onto the real story ? well , it is not very good , but i will be glad to watch it again when i get home . i wish i was going to see this movie . i have never seen so many interesting things on such a short period of time in my life .|0
"This movie makes ""Glitter"" look like ""Schindler's List."" Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting a P.O.S. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer/director/producer/actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project gone south, ""Hell Ride"" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on Bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in."|1
i find it amazing , that so many people ( probably poles ) have voted for this movie , giving me the perfect excuse to come out and show them i am not bad at writing . when i see the title , i want to make a good impression with the actors . i think i would have done just about anything to do that . but , if i was allowed to really enjoy this movie , i would like to thank everyone who has helped me on countless occasions . my mother is much better than you are in this film , because she knows her role as one of the world 's leading actresses .|0
i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the world as it truly is and that is where i will stay this time . ' ' my pleasure sir . if there is something else i can give you then please do not hesitate to reach out to us anytime , day or night . we really are very impressed with your ideas on how the world should be lived . so please feel free to visit us anywhere and have a good look . in the last two days i have seen a lot of wonderful things that i have never seen before .|0
as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it ' s not going to contain any historical material about the movie , i believe it can ' t possibly be any better . i hope it didn ' t give you a bad feeling because if it hadn ' t , there would be no need to come out with this movie . at first it did have a great film . the plot was good and the characters were entertaining , so the ending was good . but i ' ve seen worse movies and had never found anything in the films that actually impressed me .|0
most american remakes of european films are pretty poor , but this is in a league of its own . the main theme of this movie is an old western and i like that movie well enough but i think you should have seen all the terrible things that went on . it was just too much for the kids to take into consideration . it was one of those awful scenes where there were only a few people in front of the audience who actually understood what was going on . when i watch it i see myself as someone who knows how to make a film .|0
the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film . mike myers as the cat in the hat is no good , and i am left with my mouth open , wondering why this movie makes it that bad . maybe it 's because it has been nominated for an award for the worst movie on the planet and is n't really any good . but i think it is because it is the most boring thing that has ever happened to me . i was sitting in my chair and looked at the tv when this movie started to show .|0
"Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this ""film"", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. And where did they find these ""actresses""?"|1
"The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...I first tought: ""Oh No, I don't want the trail that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent killer"". But this turned out to be even worse. Typically in this American film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. I want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. The audience isn't involved."|1
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle.|1
i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie , but was profoundly disappointed . pulp has very little storyline , it just goes along with the rest of the stories - and there is plenty of stuff to go around . the only reason the film was not published was because it was not good . in fact , the only time i saw the movie was at the premiere of the first one . this was on friday afternoon and i decided to stay out late on saturday evening . i went to see a movie about a girl whose son was killed in vietnam .|0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today. Horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. I will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference.|1
See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White. They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. But, watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind.|1
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent.|1
in general , i prefer horror movies that creep me out so much i ' m afraid of everything for the rest of my life . there is even a good chance that when this film is done , it wo n't be as good as our first few films were . i don ' t know why i was willing to give it a second thought . at least i can watch it and keep an eye on the kids . i would have rather gone home and seen the show , but alas i am not allowed to see the movie . however i will tell you what i saw .|0
"""THE KING OF QUEENS,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. For that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong."|1
"i hate to admit it , but they were right to sack schrader . the opportunity is here to build a new empire . the problem is n't going to be how to use the money , nor how to turn it around . you just have to watch it happen . that does n't mean we ca n't find a way to fight back . we just have to see who gets killed first . if you are ever lucky enough to make it to the top , do not waste your life trying to get away with murder or any other acts of petty revenge .

"""Tragic Hero"" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. Also, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time.One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable."|1
three american lads are backpacking their way around europe , challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and games as they can in the space of one day . it makes no difference when they end up in the middle of an indian war . the action will not have any relevance to the main plot if there is no major plot . for example , we do not yet know the reason for the british film making . let us assume that it is from a previous life . the time has come for a new film , which is more or less the same .|0
"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the 1930s.Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate."|1
awful , awful , awful times a hundred still does n ' t begin to describe how crappy ` ` biggest loser ' ' s movie could have been . this movie was the worst i have ever seen . when you watch this movie it is hard for me to remember the first day i saw it . i didn ' t see much of it in high school , and now all i can think about is making out with one of the new york city girls who happens to have a boyfriend . why would i want to spend the rest of my days with guys like this anyway ?|0
This movie is simply bad. First of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. It leaves you with questions when you're finished. Sometimes that's OK, but not in this case.The acting is nothing to write home about. The adults does a OK job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was worst. Well, to be honest I'm not sure that was the lead role. Never quite figured who this movie was about.|1
"Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. ""K2"" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing."|1
i wo n ' t go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating , plenty of other people have done it . but to tell you the truth , i am just as confused as most people . i remember when we were all kids , we would watch a bunch of movies that made no sense to anyone in the movie . we did n't like them and could n't believe how much they annoyed us . one day , one of us asked his friend what they were doing . he replied that they were watching a horror movie on channel 3 .|0
"THE OTHER is a supposed ""horror"" movie made during the 1970s. It is not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, which starred Nicole Kidman.The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as ""the game"". One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be ""good"". The other one - Holland - is supposed to be evil.The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel."|1
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I only wish Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms...sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. There isn't much interesting going on here but Mr Ford and friends are eye candy.See him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune.|1
The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. He does -- I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments I found amusing -- Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions laid on productions by the Hays Code.|1
"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about ""cold spots"" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (""it's getting cold!"") Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary."|1
"It seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. Some manage to do so with great talent. Hervé Hadmar doesn't. On the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very ""décalé"" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade."|1
this movie was boring . very much like underworld , only even less interesting . it ' s not much of a tv show , is it ? ! i think it would be better if you could just make a movie with some really bad scenes . let me tell you what it ' s like . the movies were always so bad and the comedians so unflattering that you would rather watch an american comedy than this one . ok , you have to agree . this movie is worse than anything i have ever seen before . why do we care about such silly films ?|0
fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team , who are supposedly in contact with the soviets on a mission to extract valuable petroleum from some frozen tundra or whatever . i 'm not sure how the story comes out but we all know that the story did n't end well for the russians . it began with a bunch of russians going to see this movie . you can find any film in the world and have seen it so you know there is something important in it .|0
One of the movies i just DIDN'T want to see. I got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.Also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.|1
this homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by edgar allan poe . there is no more dialogue than the last two movies i watch . the film is based on an old , abandoned railroad track which leads to a huge bridge . the construction here was very bad , but it was better than the alternative . when you get to the bottom of the chain - link fence around the train yard , you find some kids trying to climb over and a bunch of teenagers chasing each other with sticks .|0
crispin glovers ' way of acting ( and not only his ) is tremendous . you really want to believe this guy . it was great to watch him film , but we had a better chance of catching the guy off - camera . i never expected anything like this . he obviously has some very high expectations for the film . i just assumed he would get the full story before filming it . it is nice to think there are many good parts in this film that do n't look quite as bad as it did in the first place .|0
Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short.|1
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career.|1
The Calu-what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name as well. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. Starting off with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well I can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. Poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever.|1
i ' m guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book . given the number of characters and subplots in this movie , you ' ve got to figure it was not an easy movie to write . the premise was fairly boring . the scenes were predictable , but they were all rather boring when viewed from different angles . the author is really trying to make some sense of it ( he ' s probably just playing along with the plot , as there are so few words to describe the scene ) , and he doesn ' t know what to make of how the plot turns out .|0
"Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best ""If Walt Disney had hailed from Texas, he would have made Grand Champion"" The movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (G rated) This is a masterfully crafted ""simple"" little film made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb."|1
"""The Planet"" is an astounding piece of film making. For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original sci-fi films for a long time.Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well planned action. From the opening space battle, to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above it's budget.To start with the special effects, while certainly not ""Revenge Of The Sith"" standard, they are on level, if not above, the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape."|1
Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town. The audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director. Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7, I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!|1
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development.|1
"One of the reviewers here wrote: ""Good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. Even better ending. "" All I can say is, ""Ugh."" This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian- considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So, what I am about to say is not biased by the""Christian content"" of the film. I'm not gonna bash it because it's Christian. I am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie."|1
well well , i had seen a lot of reviews on this one , and a lot of promo always goes to show how successful the company really is . so it was a relief when the movie turned out not to be bad and that it got a good lead role with some nice characters , but also a lot of crappy acting . it just did not do it justice . if you liked this movie , which i am sure we will have in the next few minutes , at least enjoy watching it . it was quite a long shot though , i guess you can imagine what it does to actors .|0
this movie was chosen , quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store . it really is not that interesting or interesting but the premise has some good character . the main thing i noticed about the show was that no one wanted to sit up there watching this movie and i thought we were all idiots for being interested in something that was so much better than anything else out there . it was very annoying to watch and it made me wonder how people would like to see this movie over and over .|0
that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow . at least ed wood ' s misguided attempt at making his life a little better will be worth noting , although in part it ' s merely an attempt at being clever . what is really difficult is the fact that he couldn ' t even make a good impression on someone who was trying to impress him . not only doesn ' t seem to work when you ' ve been in his shoes , nor can he play a game where he has to take everything in stride and give it his all without letting anyone know about it .|0
"this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentieth - century fox because it ' s one of the few works that still sells , no one can tell you how bad it is or how big the movie actually is . i mean there are really people who don ' t watch a film and do not understand the story behind the plot . the main characters are all actors with nothing on in common other than what they say to the viewers when they ask "" why ? "" . the acting seems to be fairly good since they look pretty good for someone in their late fifties and sixties ."|0
eddie fischer was simply bad . possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a small building and shot all of them , one by one . i found it hilarious how many people seemed to see him shoot them in the head with his rifle before he got through with it . well , if you are having second thoughts about film , please just wait for some other actor to show up . even if someone happens to be good at this type of film , get used to seeing these horrible movies for the last couple months .|0
adam sandler ' s movies are my favorite comedies . the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie . and , even better than that , i watch this one at least two times before i finally get to go to sleep because it ' s about all those children who were trapped in a place they never wanted to be . i just ca ' t understand how this movie should have any impact on someone like me when i already felt so safe and secure there - with them . well , i can ' t think of many other words to describe this film .|0
"I love old ""monster movies"" for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird.The ""science"" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest."|1
as an ex ( nuclear ) submarine officer i must admit this is my favorite submarine movie ( even exceeding one hundred dollars ) and i thought that the movie would make a better movie for you . if it 's not , just look what you 've done now . you have gone out of your way to make this movie more fun than it could ever be . the first three films are about kids who get hit by a meteorite when they come down from space . some of them will probably go on in their careers .|0
i attended a screening of this movie . it was wrought with cliches and very unfunny jokes and set ups all over town that made the mood in my head worse than ever before . when the credits began rolling , i started to wonder if the movie was even worth putting up with anymore . what were the odds of me having to watch another ? one of the best parts is that i could see some of the scenes where people are being tortured to death and they are not doing anything but walking around killing each other . it just does not look good .|0
"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone)."|1
Okay,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him/her but think a little less. This is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. THis is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. The only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is over an the top, nonstop, laugh your rear end off it is so stupid, badly made movie.|1
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that's the way it should be.But on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out.|1
this movie is a disaster within a disaster film . it is full of great action scenes , which are made especially to promote the story . i just wish that it did not make me want to cry . so what am i going to write about this movie ? you must think i really need to get some money from my dad . he does not have all that much money , and even in his retirement he still spends his time on the television . well here i am , at 30 , eating out of an open bag .|0
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. You get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, I imagine that caves are dark.|1
eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie , like a remake of any of the old ' attack of the aliens ' books . i watched them once , but they were all too much for me to take seriously . i did n't watch anything else from then on that night . in fact , i have seen enough horror movies to know what was wrong with these stories . it 's as if you are supposed to pick up a dvd and read the title before seeing it . there is no story there at all .|0
definition of documentary : a work , such as a film or television program , presenting political , social , and economic aspects which i have tried to avoid all these years . it does not exist . the world is a different story . but i have no doubt about this . there must be an explanation for this one . i do not see how the plot has n't been changed since 1953 . well , in the beginning , it seemed fairly easy , but then we started losing people . that did not take very long ! i was hoping that they would just leave me alone , but they were relentless .|0
To paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard Moe and Larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant.|1
I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. Of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr. Frankenstein's did. There is always something they didn't anticipate. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here.|1
i have seen this movie three times . going back to vcr ' s , in the 1980 ' s , and after a couple of minutes they came up with something that makes my jaw fall open . there was this girl from the audience , who was at her worst when it came to sex . she made me laugh and i thought it was cute and hilarious . but not really . this movie was full of crazy shit . the scene is so awful that it could be done if you had n't been such an idiot .|0
Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film.|1
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. I mention him only because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks JUST LIKE HIM playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate.|1
this movie actually almost made me cry . for starters the fake teeth . then you spot a nice plastic or drawn picture and start to laugh like you want to tell the joke , but you ca n't really do that , it just is not funny . so you turn around and get mad because you are disappointed by the acting . i will give you the real reason why . it is not funny at all . after seeing the original film , i got a good laugh when i saw it , but there were only about three years left before i could make it with any semblance of an authentic sense of humour .|0
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for ME. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly) .|1
"i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. It was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom ""hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid"".Um. Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! It is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then."|1
There are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) Copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns.|1
If you're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original, it's got some now. (Although I will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.)|1
"I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. As I lived this situation and get lost in it, I hope a similar story would inspire me. My major concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) the triangle forms ? - Why (c) & How (d) the triangle degenerates ? (a) The movie offers a plain answer: ""because it's better !"". (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together."|1
"As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.It's on par with Sam Raimi's ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. You'll see the similarities at several points. Most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best."|1
i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing . the dvd cover looked like something out of a horror movie . i had seen these movies many times , and in my experience they are bad , but nothing that is really scary . i wanted to go to the film theater for dinner , so i went straight to the restaurant . i saw it was not as good as the one where you sit at home while your child is sick . what an appalling sight that was ! why would anyone put such poor quality food into a trailer like that ?|0
okay , make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film , but i actually thought it had a good ending to it . i have seen some good movies over the years , but i can never really tell how bad one of the others is . the first part of this film was very bad . i just ca nt believe that someone who lived through life could be involved with such a horrible movie . i feel so bad for the people in the film . the director has always seemed so nice , like he liked me .|0
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It is VERY cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean I believe a guy I know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It is that bad. I noticed the name from whence this cameAsylumand I will NEVER rent anything with that name on it again!!!|1
natile portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about one of the greatest novelists to ever walk the earth . you can see for yourself that they made an excellent book , and are both extremely good characters . the premise is well planned and the plot is interesting . there are plenty of clues to the story that i would like to see ( and find ) . i am very excited to hear that this film has so much potential . i also want to know where this film will be filming and if anyone else knows .|0
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. A sick film that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money, any money at all. If anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! Your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. I beg of you, DON'T!|1
i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed , but this movie was not as great as before . i thought it a little too boring for my taste . the plot is just too dull and repetitive to keep up with . in the end , if you look hard enough you will see that the plot is just a bit too low key . this movie is not like any of the others that have taken place in our lives . some of these scenes have been on the television for years .|0
"yes , maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that does n ' t take place here on earth . i really just do not have enough facts to fully grasp the scene and i would be more comfortable saying this story was made in some other country . so if you wish to see or hear from one of my favourite movie creators please call them , as they can be very annoying when they insist on playing along with the actors and acting . i had heard about the "" bad guy "" and wondered where he got his money ."|0
wow - - this movie was really bad ! you talk about formulaic , typical movie plot ? watching this movie , i realized how badly it sucked . as i sat there , the idea of spending a weekend watching one with an audience and some friends got me thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a few friends at the theater , too . i mean , even though i knew that movies were not exactly popular in america , they sure were good at making people feel like they could fit into their lives on a regular basis .|0
despite the all - star cast , this attempt at epic fails . it comes across as a set of flat cartoon images that would make you blush . no matter how much your heart yearns to watch them , you ca n't have any desire to see the movie . besides , i thought it was pretty cool to see someone try out for a reality tv show . i mean what else can you do if you 've seen a movie like this ? there are plenty of comedies but they do n't come close . i watched one in high school and it got worse after the third episode , just like the first episode .|0
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. I just watched this film on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming film, with wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney then the film would be considered a classic, however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone, the film has slipped through the cracks.The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and was released through Paramount Pictures.|1
this is a laurel & hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a lot on an old man getting killed to make it worth watching . why ca n't i enjoy this kind of entertainment ? i have to admit that i 'm a fan of the film even though i never saw a copy . what i would n't give for one of those sci - fi shows that get me off the hook . i could see myself running home and telling my mom everything , but there is no way i will watch this .|0
this film tries to skewer the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s . guy stone is a different story , i will give him that . but there 's more here than meets the eye . i mean , if you ever want to know whether a movie like this is actually made or based on an actual movie , you just check the website and see what kind of reviews come out at the start of the series . the main character is as bad as he looks , and not very funny either .|0
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here is how the movie starts, Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is A OK as long as it only targets soldiers (In case your wondering, Men) However the virus back fires (Big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. Then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man.|1
"A moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan, and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" Really. A specialist in ""Oriental history"" who doesn't speak any Japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? Please. This looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary."|1
being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage , i have stumbled across this little treasure . action , romance , and so on . well , here is where some interesting tidbits are made . firstly , one of the first things you should really pay attention to is that it does not matter when someone is trying to get away with murder . they just do not care for what happens to them . there is absolutely nothing to stop them ; no plot or plot , no story , no idea how to save their life . but then again , many of us see this movie as a bad movie .|0
"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program."|1
naruto the anime tv series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies , and a third one is currently available . i love these things , but can not figure out why they make me sick to my stomach as an actor . in spite of having spent some time here before , it still seemed like a waste of time . on the other hand , this show was really starting to freak me out . what if i had to do it again for the rest of my life ? i was actually thinking about turning the movie off once more when something caught my attention in the back of the studio .|0
charlie chaplin responds to open auditions at lodestone studios . rival ben turpin arrives at the same studio , obviously hoping to be seen as a successful writer with an audience that can appreciate his acting talent . while this movie is really a waste of space , i am grateful that i could get a good cast based on this film . it is also true that the movie is pretty depressing , because i feel very disappointed in the production process . i always expected to be able to come up with a good script for one of these movies . but , alas , i was unable to come up with anything better .|0
If any movie ever made Italians look bad, this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I s--t on your grave. Seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly Mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right?|1
okay , it features one lovely blink - and - you - miss - it - joke ( when the dead are rising from their tombs , the names of all the gods in heaven and hell : i do n't even know what to call them , let alone make any kind of reference to anything that is real or interesting about us ) . also , the film is not very funny at all , but it has some good stuff , so there 's no reason to get excited . i would have laughed , if i had been on earth .|0
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others.|1
Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably.|1
"To think this film was made the year I was born. To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of ""homeland security"". To think this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides."|1
let ' s face it , a truly awful movie , no . . . i mean a ` ` truly ' ' awful movie is worse . the actors - well , you just have to look in their eyes at first to see what they are thinking . when they saw this movie , they ' re probably thinking , ' oh my god , it was supposed to be funny ; but this was so bad , it made me want to crawl into a hole . this is going to go on for hours , maybe even years .|0
"think jumanji but with a death curse . a bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that they had been working on in japan for years and end up getting beaten to death . i thought i was watching an action movie where the guy gets his feet cut off so he could be saved , but instead there are these weird people coming around to try and help him . they say it is the stupidest thing that has ever happened to a japanese man . i do not believe it . one of them says "" what kind of sicko would do this ?

"i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a goreporn pic . anyroad , here it comes on the airwaves . chapter 15 
 "" hey , you still up for having a couple of drinks ?

the internet is a wondrous thing is it not ? i am watching a taped episode of one of my favorite movies . i just wanted to tell you how much better this movie is , but i should have done something earlier . it makes me feel guilty because i did n't get the chance to watch it and was so upset that day . i really like this movie too . in fact i 'm quite interested in seeing the film . i even bought it last week ! it is a great comedy / horror movie . the main character is actually a woman who is suffering from a broken heart .|0
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess.|1
"what ? - that was it ? the town sheriff ( john agar ) blows up the mutant gorilla with all his teeth ? i mean , seriously ? how do they keep from jumping off and killing you when you are in the middle of making them go crazy ? and why did he send him along with me ? "" this is where the story ends . who could possibly know that a group of highly intelligent men would be working in the field of science ? we have n't heard much about what goes on between the apes and humans in their time but there may be something interesting to be read later ."|0
"Heh...I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T&A and the cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of ""Psycho"", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy!"|1
"This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series, creepy beyond words. The tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed, in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie. This episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as ""Home"", ""Humbug"" ""Bad Blood"" and ""Milagro"" for being the best in their respective season.Mulder and Scully's growing relationship is put to the test in this episode: Can they really trust each other?"|1
I love pop culture, but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this. Then, I seen an episode, and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best one they've had. He fits the character so well. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson.I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks.|1
if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture ( if you may consider it ) would be better off going by the script . i have seen many of the movies during the years of the movie but nothing could prepare me for this . in one of them my brother has been kidnapped and his parents are missing . when i was an elementary school class boy , i watched the movie that my mother made me watch ; it was terrible . the whole thing seemed to be filmed on a small screen , not in front of any person who was watching it , and then some .|0
I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work.The plot is a mixing of Stephen Hawking's Book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends, and Hawkings himself.Don't be fooled; It totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. The blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man.|1
less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they lived a normal life . how can a movie about teens be any worse ? what was the theme here ? i saw it one night when i was driving to the mall and thought , ' no , this is so wrong . i never would have done it . ' i watched the movie just to make sure that i was watching something good , but i did not realize that there actually was an actual film for this . i mean really , this is ridiculous .|0
"1 . the largest amount of money spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy 's car to save his soul from death . but then when this guy gets killed , there are lots of people who go hungry . i remember reading a movie once where it came out that the main character was in a "" coma . "" if you 're looking for a hero , you 'll have to buy some books on the subject of romance . i know this movie started out as a romantic comedy , but it had a little bit of a plot twist that left me thinking it was something else ."|0
When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. He is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and American dream-working class hero trash (which I'm not). I don't get it. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on!|1
most movies i can sit through easily , even if i do not particularly like the movie . i am really glad to be in this town as it makes me feel a lot less alone and miserable than when i left . i hope i was not such a bad friend at least . however , you are going to have to forgive me for being a horrible person when i tried to save your life . i never knew any of the kids here who would turn out like these guys , they were just so evil ! what a stupid bunch of losers !|0
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the ""Haaavaad baaa"" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. ""Do you like apples? ""the guy nods or something. ""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf."|1
Yeah great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's Australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur.|1
ok , i admit that i still associate sophie marceau with la boum . that was the main reason i had gone there . it was not to see her and to see a woman i have no interest whatsoever in seeing . she was not just any woman , though . she was the first woman i ever saw who actually looked more than good . she was a very popular movie star of the late 1970 ' 80s . we were both quite drunk by the time we reached this part of the film . you should have seen the other two theaters .|0
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the Germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film.|1
What to say about this movie? A married couple has more then just each other. After playing around for some time things gets more serious. A difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. This movie seems to be very low budget. But a good story don't have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.|1
the most die - hard worshippers of john wayne will cringe when they watch the lawless frontier . even for a poverty stricken man , james grisham may be a lot of fun and has an interesting story line to tell . but this is n't about you . this is about all those people who died on that mountain , and their families . i ca n't blame them for hating jesus as well as any of the rest of us ' s . why did it have to be one of those movies where everyone goes to see someone die ?|0
"ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looked . "" the rest of the morning was uneventful . we spent the entire ride home talking about everything and nothing . i finally got to work in the morning , not only because i had to get back to my apartment but also because i could n't wait to be done with this film . by the time my shift was over , i wanted to head home . there was no need for me to stay after school , so i made my way out to the parking lot ."|0
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews.When Moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this.|1
i would not recommend it whatsoever . it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater , but worse for my soul . there is something wrong with that movie ! ! ! it is bad enough to hear people screaming at each other every time they stand up too close to the actors . why ? because they have all such terrible costumes and nothing else really works . who needs an awful costume when you can get one that is nice and simple ? i love the way the actors move their arms and move their legs from one place to another .|0
"It seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress ""Othello"" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in ""Shallow Grave"" and (especially) ""Jude,"" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on ""Oz."" One would think them both natural Shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: Walker's Othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and Eccleston hams it up appallingly as Iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role."|1
Such pain! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. I wouldn't say this straight-to-video South African/Canadian/UK horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. I tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as I couldn't keep my eyes open.|1
in my opinion , a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and amusing . this would not be the first of many films i like to watch but there were some that might get you laughing if you read what is being asked of you . they did have some very interesting ones in addition to them , so it was a waste of time trying to see which one went on the movie screen . after watching about a dozen or so other horror movies , i just sat back and let my mind wander for a bit .|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (Mahler's 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent fan of Bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in ""The Servant"" however). Note: I recommmend multiple viewings."|1
I don't know which was worse, the viewer's made dopes of, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. Am I to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed the child was a bit dark ? Am I to believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said, hmmm this child looks a bit dark ? Am I to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records, that Lisa Hartman had this wow look on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black !|1
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand).|1
Steven Segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme's. Has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! I mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief.|1
like a lot of the comments above me , also i though this was the average scifi movie , but the dialogue was different , it had to be . the characters did not sound alike , and it was too bad that they were so good looking and even more attractive . after the script was done i left the scene with an empty stomach and started walking down the hallway toward my own apartment . at first i thought there was something strange about the cast , but as i got closer i saw that they were acting in a way that i do not know how to explain .|0
the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it ' s a load of hogwash ( the cpusa was a great idea , and a great production ) . there are numerous other plays from which we might be able to enjoy . i ' m sure there are still some very interesting characters on the main screen - although as you get older you realise there are so many more funny things to watch . my favorite part of the movie is the line between being a child and an adult and thinking that they are watching a family vacation for their friend and his wife .|0
I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction.|1
"i was duped as well . here i was expecting all sorts of man eating pirahnas and what the hell did i get when i tried it . "" you want a coke or can i get you a water ? "" no , do not drink that ! this whole night is just one big show . there are many people who would n't mind being eaten alive by a monster , especially in this movie ; they would simply like it to be their fault . i thought it would be funny to see how those characters react to being eaten for no reason ."|0
While out divining for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm.|1
"I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or David Arquette's ""performance"". It was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER!!!!)."|1
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family.|1
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell pictures for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the movie. I didn't see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY, promising I'd be back.|1
"Okay,I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this!I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD!!!! !This film is so darn bad!I never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but I did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!"|1
***SPOILERS*** Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold pouring rain.|1
My first post at the IMDb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. It doesn't make any sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. I could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rental.|1
"a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away ( sound familiar ) , water has become the most precious commodity to humanity . it is the only thing you can find worth making a living on at the very least . there is something about this story that i would have never imagined , and i had no idea how much it would actually be worth going through if it was not for its value to humanity . the first film i ever saw was one of our best films , titled the "" world of dreams . "" that movie was made in germany by a german writer named george rosenberger ."|0
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer.|1
I'm racking my brain, but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You gotta wonder why John Ford and/or John Wayne never tried it! The plot  While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus), and the rest of the cast/characters enter a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but some other, more fearsome creatures as well.|1
this film is so 1980 ' s and that is what i like so much about it . it does an awful lot to make me think of the movies in the films , as they are basically the same things that were on all those tv channels when i first started watching it . i would rather be watching a movie with no plot or plot at all then watch a comedy with no plot at all . if you 're not going to love this film , just enjoy it , it will make you happy . there was something odd about this film , however .|0
leonard can write lyrics , but he sure ca n ' t sing . nor has he had an original idea in his whole life ! this story is a complete and utter disappointment . i think i 've made that pretty clear to those around me who are not familiar with the genre . there have been so many other times when this story has lacked any kind of emotional or emotional flair , but for some reason , i thought this would be a good part of this story . if i was going to give this one a try , i had better at least attempt to find it on my own .|0
this film easily rivals the emotional strength , the dramatic impact and the top - notch performances of ` ` 12 angry men ' ( which is one of the most famous movies in all of southern hollywood ) . at the end of this movie it comes out that a young couple were having an affair with their former high school friend from college who lived in new york . they have n't been back to see each other since , but some things just do not sit right with anybody . the acting is so bad that it is nearly impossible for a person to act as naturally as you did when you showed up .|0
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ? ).This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr K's era. It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors.This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war.|1
i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded , it talks of violence and what there doing , and how it should be . in one section it is quite amusing , while in other sections has no plot at all , and only an occasional bit of funny stuff that makes sense . i do like the part about a man who falls in love with a prostitute and she does n't know it . it really sucks to watch this film . my father did not tell me about it , and i never saw it for myself until recently .|0
"this one was truly awful . watching with fascinated horror , i kept on asking ` ` why have they done this to me ? '' and ` why do you ' want to know ? "" all in all a lousy film , but i did not find much enjoyment in it at all . what i enjoyed about the movie was its premise . the plot was quite ridiculous . it looked as if the actors had spent their whole lives acting out a scene that was terribly embarrassing . the main character seemed to be a tall , thin guy who acted like a little boy ."|0
i saw this movie once a long time ago , just once , and i did n ' t know where it had ended up or what was going to happen . for the first few minutes i thought it was probably one of those dumb comedy movies that made me think they were n't bad . but as we got into the film i started to lose my patience . i guess the reason i couldn ' t see that movie again was because it didn ' t take long for me to notice that it wasn ' t being filmed there . instead , it was being recorded on tape .|0
i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone . he ' s one of my favorite actors and a good friend of yours . he won ' t even try to tell me where the money comes from . what 's his problem ? ! it ' s not like he ' s been in love with this movie for more than 30 years . how is it that you two can still make each other happy while you go through life without any real feeling for each other ? if you are enjoying this film , why do you continue to talk to people about it ?|0
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. What is just as bad is their inability to FEEL anything about it.Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget.|1
this is most likely the best picture not many will see . it presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized world that we can appreciate but would rather be on television watching than trying to make their tv show , especially if you do n't have a television . while i am a fan of sci - fi film , they are really hard to come by at times . one such episode in which a very young man tries to escape from an unknown enemy ( or what may be his ' enemy ' ) takes the first steps in a rescue and he escapes .|0
yes sure , this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it . it is not much bigger than a movie which is why it is really such an easy job . however i just wish that they had some quality tv and a decent video game system in their store . there will be so many people who come to the show for the money . you may not like them , but it will be a fun show ! i would never say anything about these movies . i think they were made for a single purpose : to please someone else .|0
Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible for a number of reasons:No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends.

bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters . steven ( andy freeman ) can be an interesting companion when he is not having a good day . we have many stories that go back to my parents and siblings , although none of these are worth mentioning ; they were never told to me by any adult in this world . for some reason i just do not know why . i ca n't tell you what they are because i could not care less . it makes no sense for anyone to write about something that has absolutely nothing to do with their own lives .|0
like all of the very earliest films , this ` ` movie ' ' is very , very short - - lasting about ten minutes longer than it really is , so i will go out on a limb here to explain what i am getting at . the first thing they do when they get around to it is put on an episode of one of my favorite movies . there were a couple of times when i thought that i had heard this film before but no one knows how long it took me to realize that it was not actually one of my favorites .|0
not as bad as ` ` billy bathgate ' ' but close . try as he might , warren beatty just could n't get his butt out of a chair . i wonder if this is even possible . i do have a small television set up in the house that would be perfect for the show . i was thinking of letting you watch it with me , but i thought you should see it after what happened to you and your parents . i 'm sure it makes you happy to know that someone else gave you such a hard time !|0
Bought for £1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. PV is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.A vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control.|1
"The sort of ""little"" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. Sort of a ""soul"" version of the more well-known ""The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells"". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas."|1
let ' s get one thing straight : i like much of snipes ' work . unlike his other high - kicking contemporaries who hate me because i make it out of the movie so easy , there is a certain dignity in it all . for example , when the movie is finished it takes about 2 minutes and goes into the movie ' s ending with a scene that should be very interesting but was actually rather stupid . if you do not know the film by heart and have been in it long enough , you might not even notice what ' s coming in .|0
this is an interesting movie . i think it ' s very humorous , although the humor is very black . i could ' t tell at all if this is a comedy or not . i would take my shoes off as fast as i could , but most of them have to be carried in a bucket . the only real thing that really matters is how the action plays out . you ' ve got to understand that this movie has become quite boring and i want to turn it off and go home . no one was looking for a good time .|0
warning - possible spoilers ! ' rock star ' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen . so , how come i 've never heard of such a film ? i did wonder why rock star actually made this movie out of rock stars in the first place . he 's not an actor . and if you 're a rock star then you should know that rock stars do n't make much money . rock stars go for the big things , like gold , jewels , gems , art , or anything else they think would be worth seeing .|0
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job. On the DVD version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty.|1
"First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie ""Embryo"" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Okay, in all honestly, I didn't know all this, but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of ""Embryo"" could have done."|1
I was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do I have channels... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... DVD has spolied me.Anyway, I'm flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it.|1
"whoa . i mean , whoa . i mean , whoa whoa . i saw this movie , waaay back when i was six . it was hilarious . i had a feeling that the plot of the movie was different somehow . i got a strange feeling in my gut about something . i didn ' t know what it was until i watched it and read its title . but then i got an odd feeling about it too .

"Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out the sister is part of a Jim Jones type religous cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. This is another (!) cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if not for Lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior ""The Man from Deep River."""|1
"i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary . one reviewer on four word film review ( www . fwfr . com ) says , "" i have seen all kinds of books and films in this period but it never even started at the beginning . i like the movie itself , but i can tell there are no answers to the questions we want to ask . why did he decide that this book was not for us to read ? is there some reason for him being such an excellent reader ? do you think he should be allowed to choose what he sees or hear about in his book ?"|0

i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie . now i 'm pretty sure there was more to it than that . but it 's really funny . let me make sure i have this straight . i am in the middle of being so drunk that i wo n't tell anyone where i was going . i had gone into my parents ' house for a quick smoke when i felt something grab me by the hand and yank me backwards . i was so caught up in my fun that i got scared and looked down to see what they were doing with me .|0
"I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I was hoping it would end.It had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and Years) together in ""Separate"" beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. He does kiss her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible about it. Very little substance to grab your interest. The acting just does not hold up. He is very passive."|1
The Toxic Avenger, hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, whom is in cahoots with an evil corporation who just want the avenger gone to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less grim, much more comical tone, and a plot line that can't hold a candle to the original.|1
I know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. However, unless you really love this sort of art or are a Canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish.|1
Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue sucks too.|1
"i like steve buscemi . i like his work very much , both as an actor and a director . but i did n't do this . there was a reason i never gave him the money to film in the first place , it was that he wanted to be part of a movie that i really love , so i gave him $ 50 , 000 because he is one of my best friends and i thought we were making a huge difference in people ' lives ( at least until i looked down at the photo of him on the cover of our local magazine ) .

this film has it ' s heart in the right place , but unfortunately , it is n ' t much of a movie . at first it looked so fun , i just could not understand why it would be allowed to have a film like this . i ca nt believe i had to watch this stupid tv show when it was only for $ 2 per hour as a job . it was so bad that i wanted to rip my shirt off and spend the next 5 minutes being sick over one of these idiotic films . there are two things on this planet that i absolutely love about movies .|0
As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was Bad Acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse.|1
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are to late. Apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. I'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to Curse of the Komodo which also sucked. The computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves.|1
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was I wrong. This film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. I cannot comment on the ending because I just couldn't stand watching the whole film. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. So if you are having trouble with sleep then I recommend that you rent this film.|1

The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings.|1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!|1
"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.The cast is nice."|1
to tell you the truth , i do not speak tamil , and i did not understand the film . this film had no good endings . i was really impressed with it - there were many times i asked for a different production . however , this story is just too complicated for me to keep up . why would anyone want someone to make such a movie ? when i found out who was in the film , i thought that they must have done something terrible . the reason why i found out was because the director could not get his plot straight .|0

Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, I was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. It wasn`t just Bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. Add to that a plot liken to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as I`m concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I taped it.|1
In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo comes to London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.|1
"Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot ""Thirst"" - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong."|1
i ca n ' t believe that isaiah washington and ice - t were in this mess ! the plot ( and i use the word loosely here , it was a joke ) is not funny . i did n't know what we would get ourselves into by going out there to watch the show . as much as i liked the episode , i think i was too excited to watch the whole thing . after all , my friends are in danger , and i want to go and make sure they are okay . i wanted to be at the house when the show started , but could not do so .|0
This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War--most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION--a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer.|1
There's a good story well hidden and never really used! The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. What is left is muddled and superficial.Turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.Watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.|1
once again , bugs bunny sacred home is violated by careless people . this time the traveling circus put a good spin on its performance and has made all of hollywood 's critics look bad in comparison . what they did was not to make fun of the actors but instead highlight how their lives have been forced into this world . why do you think we are stuck in this place ? first of all it looks as if there is some sort of battle going on . there is blood everywhere ! that is why it is hard to see anything else through the dark night .|0
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an over used story but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days.|1
dire ! dismal ! awful ! laughable ! disappointing ! right , your trapped in ` ` the cave ' ' with all its bad movies ! . i know this movie was not a joke to you at any point in your career but if you wanted it so bad , you should have stayed in the game and watched something interesting . this is the only movie i have ever seen where it was just funny . when you watch this series , you think it is hilarious because the plot is funny . this is nothing compared to the jokes on this film .|0
"A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" of the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent."|1
"i do n ' t think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about , the main thing is a lot of interesting people are involved and some of them might even be able to help if you just follow their lead and have a good time . as for the rest of it , it makes me very sad . "" with that he turned his back on the screen again and started walking away . she tried to keep up but felt like someone trying to drag her along . in fact it seemed that she had never seen anyone walk so fast in all my life ."|0
this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : ' ' quirky ' ' and obnoxious characters ' - but as it continues to go , it becomes more and more popular with everyone . i am beginning to see how the plot of this movie could be very funny . the first scene was when we all got home from work one saturday morning . my wife and i were in the kitchen preparing a late night snack and we were just talking about our weekend . i have not seen or spoken to my children in over a week and they are always on their way somewhere .|0
in michele soavi ' s confusing art - house zombie film , dellamorte dellamore , rupert everett plays francesco , a caretaker in the middle of a haunted mansion . at this rate i will not make it through the entire movie ! i just hope that my readers enjoy this movie . although i do have a few interesting comments to make as well , please keep an eye out for any changes that might follow . if you find anything that makes you happy ( or useful ) please write to me . we are all so grateful for this special opportunity to learn more about the author .|0
its gon na be hard to make this fill 10 lines . . . . but ill give it a try ( just in case that 's where you got this coming ) . . . i do nt know why anyone would ever like this book , it was such a crappy film and the plot seemed pretty boring when i watched it earlier today . if you are looking for someone who wants to change the genre of this movie , please use your own experience as a guide to read what you see . it is a very short story that contains an element of intrigue .|0
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? This is one of those films. It was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity.In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language.|1
this film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites . castle in the middle , i would never be surprised if that was a double entendre by some of the best actors ever to grace the ' d - series . the acting is bad , the plot is bad , the actors are stupid . you can see why i liked these movies because i could see why most of them made fun of them , but now i do n't care for the premise . it all seems like too good to be true . just what am i looking for ?|0
this is a spin off of pulp fiction . i thought that it would be good for a few decent horror films to try . if you have been reading this , you also know that most of the plot does n't even seem to exist . not that many people get to actually see the movies . as a small - time film nerd , i could n't handle watching them in order to enjoy myself . after seeing the show and knowing what they had to offer , i found myself turning my whole life upside down trying to understand the dynamics behind the series .|0
"i believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of its creator . "" "" who are you and what did you do with your original manuscript ? "" asks the director , who is standing in front of the projector . 
 "" i am the author of an article by a group of writers that have had some serious fame and well - earned money . as a young man , i became obsessed with following this story through to its climax . one evening i decided to try and finish it . i read the first chapter and felt totally inspired ."|0
The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is BORING>BORING> BORING and BORING!!! This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film.|1
This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep.|1
"if good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made . ' "" 
 i laughed as he told me about that film . it was my first time seeing it and i loved the movie so much that i have not had the heart to turn it off yet . i hope it will get better soon , but i doubt it . at least i would like to think that it will get better . i really hate the movies . they just do n't make any sense . why ca n't anyone just play along and enjoy the movie ?"|0
i must have been in a good mood to give this shameful , predictable , embarrassing movie even a 3 for two . it was bad enough being part of the ' rock ' and roll industry but this is so much more ! i think i am going to vomit . i do not know why this should be funny , let alone make me feel like laughing . instead , just because i can not understand the words on the screen , that does not mean i need to read them . if you have an opinion , please share it with your friends .|0
so what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks ? i know , become a sex icon , go to the dentist , and be stuck for three hours . there would have been plenty of time to find myself in a better position to take some satisfaction out of a good - looking girl who actually had something going on . but it has not happened , so i think i am doing all right . let me rephrase that : i really think i am doing just fine . still , i do feel very happy about these movies .|0
following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry , a charming young woman becomes a vampire . not only that , but an old man gets bitten by a crazed vampire . it is n't pretty . at first i am skeptical about the idea of vampires being real - but then i have seen movies of vampires on television and i know what they are capable of . when i saw this film i thought we were going to be thrown out of the country for the next fifty years . i figured there was one more way to keep ourselves out of trouble if we got caught .|0
i ca n ' t understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5 . 2 / 10 ? it really is great , very funny . as you see it , the characters are in a state of disarray and there is no explanation of how some of them get back to their normal lives . the only conclusion i can find is that one of them was trying to turn the camera on the actors , then he lost it and started screaming . all i can say is that at least now i can make out a few of the words that were said .|0
i usually seek to find good in movies , even the bad ones . unfortunately this movie is one where i fail to see how it all started and ends . the only thing left that seems to make any sense here is a girl who lives on the same side of town . as i walk through town i can hear the laughter of my fellow citizens from the theater . as i continue walking i look for something to say but there are no words worth saying . instead i just feel like i 'm in a nightmare . what kind of person would want to die like this ?|0
for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i found that the plot has a pretty good time . in fact there are some interesting stories which i found interesting and i am very curious to know what these two people have been talking about . i just could not get my head around it all . the first part was a great idea , the script was excellent so i think the plot was great . it was funny to see the scene play out so badly . the next part was horrible .|0
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of lonliness is the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away.|1
if you love chan - wook park , you know what to expect . his films are brutal , poetic , tragic and not at all appropriate for a city full of teenage girls . this film is bad because i do n't know what the plot is . i really liked him better when he was singing about people who have been murdered by zombies . but that was the only time i ever heard him sing in such a loud voice as he did in that movie . so far , there have been numerous comedies like this one , but i have yet to watch one of them .|0
Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising.Once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As would be obvious, they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings.|1
"the story is about a psychic woman , tory , who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic experiences . for those of you who have spent time on the internet , you know what i mean . "" "" how many times do they get to see themselves in the mirror while doing this ? it 's disgusting . "" she held up two fingers as if to say "" stop being so stupid . "" "" okay , sorry , that was n't supposed to happen . i just thought it would be more entertaining to watch them in real life , not in the movie ."|0
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I couldn't understand more than about 15%(the fancy English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. Didn't find it funny, didn't find it amusing, didn't find any sense in it.|1
This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet.Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and riveting. His displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow, love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or over-the-top. In fact, some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression.|1
while watching blackwater valley exorcism , i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this film would not end well . however , this film did . the first few lines are all about how many people there were who were being tortured , and how much they needed a trial or two to get out of their situation . i really do n't know why the movie should be such a big deal . i mean , when you have lived for over thirty years on the same planet as your country - what does it matter how many people have been tortured ?|0
if you want to truly experience the magic ( ? ) of don dohler , then check out ` ` alien abduction ' . i know it is an incredibly bad film , but for this one it is a real shock . it is not just a video game movie , but a sci - fi action adventure . it shows the evil queen and the people she tries to keep from getting married in secret . the whole thing is so much worse than the actual movie itself ! the characters are totally repulsive to me , because i like them .|0
the film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere - - in africa , australia , india , europe . you name it . and then there are those who want to have this movie destroyed . they will say that it is nothing of the sort . it would not do any good or make any impression on me , so i just shut up . i saw it on the internet once , and it did sound funny . but what really bothers me about this movie is how everyone else seems to be going about their own business .|0
this movie ' s only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free , and that it had all been done in the early 20th century . there was probably something to that , especially with the number of movies we had watched before . i remember when i was in high school i saw a comedy about a teen girl who discovers her mother murdered . the story was terrible and she felt awful about having to share it with a bunch of people who would rather ignore it than tell it to anyone . the film is completely lame , but at the same time it 's hilarious .|0
Thank God I have fast-forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Whatever: It's a stupid cliché. It doesn't make any difference. There's this guy, javier Bardem, who constructs buildings or something. It doesn't matter. He is handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there is a car wreck but I watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? Car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me.|1
"""Strangers on a Train"" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's ""Speed."""|1
This is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies I've seen for awhile. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks from Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the Chupacabra of legend is much smaller. All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. Why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the Chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do OK??|1
an hulking alien beastie crash - lands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun and causing great pain and anguish to innocent bystanders . that 's how i like it . some of the best films you could make in life were made in this period , which would be no different . most of these movies are made by a group of men or women , but as far as i can see there are very few people who ever do anything for real . the main feature is an old man and woman with one child ; the poor man is being attacked by a large dog .|0
i had to watch this movie for a film class , i suffered the whole time through . i am pretty sure it was not that good , but it really sucks . the movie is so awful that i felt i would rather be there with them . the plot is terrible . some of the characters die . others get eaten . i have to admit that the movie sounds like something that would have been funny if it were done at all . the plot is a total waste of talent , and i can not take credit for making it interesting .|0
just a great soundtrack . really enjoyable music . outstanding cast , great lead performance . worth watching . does n ' t really care how well it plays . it just feels like someone 's giving us some of their money , but we ca n't seem to get it back . is this another one of those terrible movies where they throw away all the money from an actor ? if you were there when it started , why did you love it as much ? what was the point in acting if you were n't going to have something to show ?|0
i suppose i ' m supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt . these laboratory movies ( if that is what you were hoping for ) may not have been the best , but i didn ' t really expect anything different . first of all , the book was basically one of the worst ones i have ever read , and secondly , my father had made a point of having me read every single thing he put in it . i know this must seem strange to you , but sometimes you just want to be around someone who loves you .|0
*Minor spoilers* I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons.|1
there are places for political commentary in film , but ` ` masters of horror ' ' is not one of them . i would be surprised if you had a video of this film to look forward to . no ? well , at least it 's not pornographic , so i do n't see why it would be funny . the only movie in the entire history of cinema written down was the first movie made in 1998 . by the time it aired , it was a little over a year old . after that it became almost impossible to go back to its original name .|0
"with great expectations i went to see this film , spain ' s contribution to the oscar - race this year . part of me wanted to be a lawyer , while the rest of me was excited to see this film because i would like to try it one more time before i had to leave for college in the spring . but as i am being offered the chance to do something really interesting , i thought there was no way i was going to watch this . 
 "" what is this horrible film ? "" i ask the camera operator . 
 """|0
ok , when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations . yes , the acting is great , and it makes me a lot of money , but the plot ... well , it is not what you think . the plot is stupid , as i already knew it would be , because i am always going through these things . i really do not know what they are like , so i could just write a story to help the writer understand it . but that would never have been a problem . the first thing i had to pay attention to was the way the lines were played .|0
"This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round"" theater."|1
Without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. If the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven.One wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast. (Well - not really!) The premise is a good one The situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done, but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor said, they changed writers and handed over to someone else.|1
better than average world war ii - era ` ` who - dun - it ' ' featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and the use of drugs to hide his identity . but for some reason he has not been recognized . in fact , i am beginning to wonder if i was right about him . however , this one does have a certain appeal to it . i can see that this story was originally written at least ten years before its publication , so you may be thinking , ' these characters are nothing more than a bunch of self - centered idiots with no love for humanity .|0
"this movie deserves a 20 / 10 if i could give one . ` ` the hollow ' ' is a great hercule poirot "" ; and the characters are wonderful . there was so much fun when i read them , but i ca n't recall ever reading anything so stupid . i would like to take a walk with you tonight , but i really must see what i can find out . it will have been a pleasure to watch this film over and over again , but now i am going to turn it off . it makes me want to jump up and down and scream ."|0
This is marvelous movie, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes talk. Especially on the silent scenes. The window of Ale is a great one. An the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I have seen. Apart from directing. It has been a quite time I did not watch a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul.|1
"i ' d heard about this movie , but did n ' t see it until my daughter , who saw it on the big screen , took some pictures . then she watched it instead of going back to her friends and watching it herself . that s one reason why i had to follow her down to the movies when she told me we were going to watch a movie with her brother and sisters . she wanted me to get in on the fun .

"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. ""The Mad Monster"" is no exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. The filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level."|1
"The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at ""My Maisonette"". Hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of ""alternative comedy""(I hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on TV today.I'm glad that on a trip of local DVD retailers today ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" was sold out across the board."|1
"I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ""The Dain Curse"". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film ""The Molly Maguires""). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south."|1
i watched this episode a lot of times because i did n ' t get how prue died . this is what it meant to be a cop ; you would think i would know that . for a little while there was nothing more terrifying than seeing two people murdered in their homes . but then i lost my temper with them and they all ended up paying the price . i do n't know why the movies started on a bad note , maybe it 's because they were so easy to watch at any other time .|0
The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations.Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one.|1
"Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement I was able to attend at the ""Rolling Thunder"" screening at the Parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th Dec 2004. Of course the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other movie I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized."|1
Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow.|1
firstly , let me make it clear that i love aircraft , and usually any film with them in is just a parody of what the movies look like , so i decided that i should take advantage of a little quality time to try to get some ' entertainment ' ( or even a chance at something good ) if i could . after all , this is not my first time looking at a p - 10 . they have a lot of people out there that enjoy watching p * * n as much as i do , but this is one of those days when you know your life is over .|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You'd think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising.|1

actually , son of the mask did make me laugh a few times . . . mostly due to the cartoonish jokes he made when he could n't quite figure out what i was telling him . and it just kept getting longer and longer , so i came to believe that it was one of those funny films about people having their faces removed and not being able to move or talk with each other at all . it was also one of my favorite movies , but even more than that , it reminded me of my own childhood in this very town .|0
i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i ' d be able to relate to this film perfectly . its so funny , the first two episodes of this film were almost as hilarious . i ' ll have to make an example of you when i get a chance to do something about this movie . i ' m just not very good at making movies . i ' ve seen lots of films from that time period and i don ' t feel like watching them anymore . the most important thing for me right now is to get it all together and finish my film in time to see the other characters .|0
unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey ( producing and starring ) has been involved with for many years , he had a bit more to work with then the rest . it is his job to make sure all actors are well - behaved and well behaved in public . however , he also has to ensure they get everything they ask for while being treated like children . you may think i would have found something better about such a movie , but no , this film was not bad .|0
Oh f*cking hell, where should I start... First of all; this show is just another stupid American non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. The American way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example).|1
veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding , confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the book . here is one of the most interesting scenes of the film , as you will probably not find it on the cable channels in this part of the city . it started with a guy who was arrested at a gas station for a bomb scare . he could have been killed by his friend or any other person . when he went to the bathroom he saw a large group of people trying to fight off some kind of unseen force .|0
last year was the 200th anniversary of charles darwin ' s birth , and the 150th anniversary of the publication of this book . in this book there are some instances where the story is actually told by one particular person , but that does not change the situation . it has been made a very special film because it portrays the early years of christ as the son of a great man who created a city called jerusalem on the mediterranean sea to save his own life . when christians started believing in the god of israel , they were more inclined to believe in him than he was .|0
okay , i grew up on who , but have n ' t loved a doctor since tom baker . christopher eccleston was a good friend to me after the incident when i came out of the room for a while in a rage because i thought there was some conspiracy afoot . you could see the humor in it all . he and his family were at the hospital that day to try to catch the guy who committed the act . they got arrested by police . i had no idea what kind of trouble they would get into , but i had this feeling that there was one .|0
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art.|1
"Let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : ""Let's see who is meanest"" said with a straight face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny.How do you think Arnold will battle the evil of all evils?Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even Satan expected it they're so clever.After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate) it goes nowhere. Somebody get me those two hours of my life back."|1
"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa delle anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad."|1
the only reason i checked this film out was to see the ` ` early ' ' kim bassinger . that , and because i thought she looked very good in her new dress . i had to admit , i liked kim bassinger as a lot better . it just would not have been fair to give her the job if i had been willing to pay for her to come back to the states and work for me . i love my wife , and i am grateful for the opportunity she has given me to work for her .|0
river ' s edge is an excellent film and it ' s a shame that it has n ' t made more of a hit in the recent movies . i don ' t have much tolerance for comedy and i like the plot , so this should be fun . this is a particularly boring story which was not meant to be viewed by anyone on this stage . you can certainly tell that there is a lot of dialogue , yet it doesn ' t make any sense at all . it ' s just not about love or romance or anything - it ' s about sex .|0
you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one - liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder if this was actually a movie of all time . the story has to be told by someone who really knows what they 're doing . you would think a person would be able to put their ideas into movies at least once before getting sucked into the movie . for me , it 's not that i am such a prude , but in these films , i always find it interesting how fast the characters change or become more animated as they go through scenes .|0
yes , it ' s a sbif ( so bad it ' s funny ) classic . with a budget running into the ground , you would not want a big budget of this size . i know what you ' re thinking , but they don ' t even pay you money for these movies . there is a lot of money to be made in films , and this one will be an exception . this film was designed for people who were willing to learn how to do things . as the story goes on , i can see the plot is just a bit too amateurish to suit this situation .|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I wasn't watching it for free, I would have never finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever.|1
"i probably have to blame myself but i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the book . "" so you 're a vampire fan or what ? "" he shook his head . "" it 's just not my thing . if i were , i 'd be one of the few who could make it to see it . then i would have no problem doing this . unfortunately , i do n't know many people who can do this and i do n't think anyone in this movie could do this . i used to be one of them . i 'm sorry ."|0
Personally, I have no problem with the acting, nor the script. I do have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Plain and simple.One's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. What were they thinking!? Budget be damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke.Of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. Oh well. What is done is done.|1
i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential , but nothing more , because boy did it get me really mad . i hated every minute of it . that 's how bad it was on the movie , though . it was so awful that no one ever saw it . for instance , in one of the most depressing films i have seen in over 20 years , my husband is sitting by the side of the road and his head is bashed in with a hammer . he is dead . the police found him in the woods behind the cabin , and they wanted to investigate .|0
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Modern love...thats for sure. In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants.|1
"i used to think that it could n ' t get worse that ` ` army of the dead ' ' but this load is much worse , "" said bob . he looked around again at his audience . "" and it didn ' t even have a movie plot in it . we ' ve lost all hope of making it to the next big thing . it ' s too late to watch an old film or learn how to make popcorn . "" then he looked at the others . "" if you want to laugh , i ' m a terrible actor ."|0
"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out ""Undisputed 2"". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched ""The Shepherd"", I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen."|1
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know.|1
"I was unsure what to expect from ""driving lessons""- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie."|1
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen ! the plot revolves around a man named tom robinson who makes a movie that you can hardly believe has ever made . it just keeps going right in front of your eyes for weeks . i ca n't believe how stupid it all seemed and how stupid it looked when we saw the whole thing . it seems to me like it should be shot before it plays out . but no . the only problem was , they did not see it coming . first of all , what could possibly go wrong with such a horrible movie ?|0
i rented this movie , after hearing chris gore saying something to the effect of ` ` five stars ! ' ' you should see his face when he hears that line . ' i guess i can see that there are a lot of people who have n't seen this movie in a long time . one thing is for sure , we are going to get to see this film too . and it is just not fair . why could n't we just go out and buy another movie ? oh yeah , i hate movies that do n't make any sense even if i had to choose between a comedy or a thriller .|0
i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died........... the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the spell which send him away but not vanquished. (NEEDS THE POWER OF THREE)leo comes heals them both and so on. they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named tempus to turn back time.|1
bottom - of - the - barrel stinker is so bad it ' s beyond funny . the ` ` plot ' ' is about an american mercenary , who travels through france and america , in order to get information from the cia . he is a good friend of one of our colleagues in washington . i know him because he went on a business trip to paris with me at his last tour . there ' s plenty of things about him you don ' t want to see . he was nice , friendly , funny , clever , and had some great qualities .|0
We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is.|1
the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style , because there ' s absolutely no substance . this film is just nothing like any movie i ' ll ever see . it ' s about a group of characters whose lives are on the verge of going down in history as they try to make a difference for their people . there ' s some serious character - making involved , with some scenes being forced upon others . the main thing is that the protagonist can ' t keep his own mouth shut , and the action gets so bad he loses his nerve .|0
ineffectual , molly - coddled , self - pitying , lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard . after several years , she 's taken the money from her father and moved into a modest home on the outskirts of orlando . she has a beautiful dog , a mix of poodle and dog . they do n't look much alike , but with hair like theirs , it will have to be enough . she does n't have many friends in orlando . i was not surprised when she decided to give up teaching at a community college .|0
this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot . i know , i know . i was just a kid and i still remember when i was a kid . you see , my parents got into a fight . they had been fighting for about three days after they came back to visit me . there was a whole stack of magazines and some pictures of me . my mom said something about trying to make it up to me , that i needed to be more mature than i was , but really she was just trying to make me look like a nerd .|0
directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz . a young mother selma lidz ( andie mcgarvey ) was kidnapped by a man whose name she could not remember , and that is why they were unable to find her at all . as the horror of her kidnapping comes to their attention , there are those who want to go and try to make it better . the story tells more about her than it lets on . she is a good kid , but unfortunately for her , there is no one who understands her and wants to make her feel better in some way .|0
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film. For the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. It seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. Also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. Perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid.|1
i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma . com with the ruining ( which is n ' t really awful ) . i think you can tell what a film was . it was mostly about an old lady that had a car wreck when she was 17 or 20 years old . i think she was looking for somewhere to settle down and take a vacation , but could find nothing worth renting in a town such as troma unless you wanted to rent a house off the main street . i think that was the last movie on the dvd shelf .|0
i can not stress how bad this movie is . this director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making the film , and then he did the same thing that had been on tv since it came out a few years ago . so , we have now seen five films , each of them very poorly done , and are wondering what the heck they were supposed to be doing . i really feel like i should have been watching something else instead of this crap , but i just could n't seem to focus on any of those programs .|0
Don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you.|1
this horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where i thought to myself ` ` this is one of those times where the plot is just so ridiculous , and i am actually looking forward to hearing how it gets made . that is not going to happen . you can not imagine how much i have wanted to hear about such things in my life for many years . the thing is , i really had no idea it was going to be this stupid . i never would have been able to watch any of these shows if i had known !|0
komodo vs . cobra is not going to set the world on fire . it ' s not a hallmark of cinema , or a comedy , or even any other type of drama . i ' m not saying that we should watch it either . there are a lot of films you don ' t like , and they make your head spin . but the main thing for me now is to spend as much time watching the show as i can . in this case , it is really just an episode about the history of hollywood .|0
"One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films, ""Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - American people trying to sound Scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others).Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle."|1
"It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops ""Derailed"" and ""Second in command"" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film ""Until Death"" had no martial arts in it at all!! !That being said, this film is significantly inferior to ""Until Death"" which was a really good turn for Van Damme."|1
A very good film, focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children struggling with this world wide. The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented.|1
i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film . trouble is , the content could have been much more pleasant if i had n't heard that this was only going to be the worst film of its kind yet . there are two major characters and one character who plays a role in them . the third character is a woman with long red hair ( not very chic ) and eyes that look as if they are trying to tear you to shreds . she has an attitude that makes it hard for people to get serious about her .|0
i ' m a big fan of patricia hodge and mariam margolyes , so i watched this show when it came on . the director was trying to explain how the movie works , but he could never think straight . he was making excuses for it , and acting out his scenes . we were going to start filming in an area that would probably not be considered a safe environment by some people . as soon as those ideas entered your head you decided to change the scene and make it interesting . i just ca n't recall exactly why or what caused me to watch the show .|0
Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction.|1
I've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it.I'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. That being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away.|1
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity.|1
OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart.|1
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film ? it was given to me on video . you know , i really felt like a kid in a box and could not wait to see the first movie of the year . how many times have i told you to watch this film ? if you are reading this then we need to stop because that 's the only way for us to do this job . the story is basically one - sided . the plot is just plain crazy . i ca n't believe this ! there is no way i would even consider viewing this film .|0
i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was i right in assuming it was not the movie itself ? there are always things that can go wrong for a story . well , it worked out pretty well for its first one , so i guess there was some small disappointment in having to make a final effort to stop it . however , after looking at the scene where the character is killed in front of her own family , i find that i do not really care if i see any more movies on this screen .|0
we all know that the world is full of dodgy , rip - off horror films . some of these can be a lot of fun . let me try to explain . if you have ever read this film then please consider giving it a few seconds to think about what it is really worth doing . i could tell you more about it when you got into the ' 60 's . i was in the movie for 20 years before coming to los angeles . i saw this movie but did not realize just how many people were involved .|0
This is an excellent, little known movie. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I'd love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players.|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. She just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there.|1
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. Non The main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage.|1
i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person . this movie made me really want to do something fun like read , write or do anything else . if i have learned anything from all the movies i discovered it was that people are so easy to love when they see their loved ones for the very first time . what is wrong with me ? why ca n't i enjoy what is being played and enjoy the fact that some good times come along in the next 10 years ? i had to get back to work as fast as i could .|0
New rule. Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea.Sadly, this movie doesn't. They have the premise that Bounty hunters go out and kill Zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten bounties for one Zombie? Why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a Zombie finger? Not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle.I sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and FX guys.|1
i ' m trying to understand what people liked about mirrormask . i am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film buff . i had no problem watching this one , or any of the others , over the last three months . it made me wonder how many more films would have to remain on dvd for long . if we can find enough evidence to convince a movie producer to sell them at a discount price , perhaps we could even make some other movies . just then the sound system went silent and i realized everyone in the room had died .|0
"a young couple decides to runaway to sunny california . they never reach their destination as they decide to pull off the highway and head out into the woods to find a motel . chapter 17 
 that same night , when i get up to shower and dress for the movie , i am surprised to see an empty bed in my room . this is strange . i have not heard anyone snore in my room for a long time . since i was at home with my mom , i started sleeping in my mother 's old bedroom . i usually wake early on sunday morning because it is always dark and dreary ."|0
River's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one. Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.|1
i was at a friends house for thanksgiving and watched a dvd of the movie , eddie monroe . i felt like it had been filmed in one of those cheesy horror movies that only you can see in any kind of horror movie because they really do n't have anything better to do . when the movie started , there were so many people talking and laughing and we thought it was all some kind of horrible prank . then this guy tells them that he wanted to talk to us . what a moron . i remember him talking about his girlfriend , laura .|0
we all know what chan - wook park can do . if you have n ' t seen oldboy ( or the sympathy trilogy , that is ) i suggest you find this movie a little more interesting . as i stated earlier , it gets better every time you read about it . at least this one has been pretty good , so i could say for sure there are good reasons to enjoy it . here , though , i would like to say that when i first saw this movie , it looked great with my eyes but it soon deteriorated when i saw it was a parody of a horror story .|0
"Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films, and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the ""Wanted"" signs. The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene at the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking, as sound is never something you needed with him."|1
lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people . this story makes it sound like someone else lives there with him or something , but the truth is , the boy has been adopted by his mother . he does not really want to have any friends , and at first he does not seem interested enough to go out with anybody . his mother , however , insists that this story was made up to make her son more comfortable so that she could ' feel ' how awful it must be for him .|0

While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer.|1
i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films . i found the film at first boring , but now it 's very entertaining and i enjoy watching it as much as any person else . the movie has such a good feel to it that i decided to look it over anyway . it takes place in a large room where all the walls are covered with photographs of famous actors , actresses and even some of my best friends from high school . they all have similar appearances , but each has different expressions of the same personality . well , it was actually just one of those things .|0
this telecast of the classic musical ` ` sweeney todd ' ' does not do the production justice , but is still very popular with the audience . i would have preferred to film this in one of the theaters than on the tv channel , but that was not a choice as there was no way to be allowed to stop the movie until after it had even begun . i could have just edited this and played it as if nothing had happened . instead , i watched it in the theater while the others sat around and waited for the plot to come up .|0
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles.|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film.|1
Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.But this movie?|1
this was a very good ppv , but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later , the wwe crammed so much action that i could hardly see the end of the film , and i was too tired and bored to watch it anyway . it took only two hours , just to go to bed at 1 am . when i finally got off the elevator at 2:08 am i found myself in a big empty warehouse with nothing to show for it but an empty office . the walls were made of thick brown bricks , and the floor was black concrete .|0
Hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius.|1
for the record , i hate spoof movies . except for mel brooks and airplane ! because those are classics , you would think they would n't be any better than this . it really sucks . if i had seen this film in the first month of my college career , i may have been able to find a way to spend some extra money on something different , but now all i have is a box full of crappy movie trailers . i do n't understand why people insist on having so many things that we do not know about the movie .|0
A woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. We also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse.|1
so bad , it ' s entertaining , especially during cocktail hour , and believe me , you ' ll need a good shot for this . i ' ve seen too many of them in my life ( as a child ) to count . however , there ' s nothing like seeing the best movie ever made . the worst thing that can happen is someone getting eaten or worse . if you are going to be an actor , you don ' t want to put yourself through that sort of film - unless you want to be the most famous actor in hollywood .|0
this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd . i loved those six movies because they had a wonderful plot and dialogue . the best part is that it would never come to an end for anyone . if there is one person you can trust to keep the story from going too far into the past , it is me . i do n't remember reading much about this movie until now ; i hope i have n't overstepped at all . i love my friends , but they are a pain in my butt . what 's so weird about these stories is that they actually work .|0
warner brothers produced this 3d extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 . guy madison leads them to the film , but he has no ability with a camera or even a radio , so he plays along like he ' s a star . there is just nothing i can do about what he is doing , other than show it to my readers and tell them to put it on a website . i guess you can say i ' d rather watch these movies than spend the money . i watched most of those shows while growing up , but i ' ve seen many of the others .|0
this movie narrate the story of john belushi , based of his biography ` wired ' , wrote by bob treacher . there is no other film like this in any of the theaters i have visited and been in over the past two weeks . a great piece of art is shown on one of these shows and it is a real letdown to see the actors acting so poorly ( as if they really knew how hard it was to do what they were supposed to be doing ) . the play is not very realistic but it seems to go off without a hitch .|0
This movie sucks so bad. Its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained American twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. As for the bit where they make the French President drink 'bad water', that was just lame.|1
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.|1
I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. What was John Landis thinking?I know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! Even kids hate this movie. It's pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.I think the only reason The Stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.|1
"this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with ""cat from outer space"" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!"|1
it was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the ` ` thief ' ' was just an ordinary man , who worked for the police . my own father said he heard this story but did not like it . i ca n't explain it better than that . i loved that movie . it 's a terrible waste of time . all i could see in the movie was that they were running around looking for someone , and that someone may be dead . i wanted to cry , but my eyes would not move . the story is almost funny .|0
but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time . i got this dvd cheap , with an awful number of reviews from some of the other shows and people who made this movie , and it just had to be the best ! i mean , what does that even have to do with anything else ? why would anyone make a movie like this over and over in their own homes ? well , there was definitely something wrong with the premise and it did not go very far when you think about how bad the characters are compared to these guys .|0
for those that might send me nasty e - mails , shove it . there is a trend in hollywood where those who do not follow this film are given the bad guys role , but then there is also a trend where those who do join in have to go with their friends to the movies . what really sucks is that i ca n't figure out how to get into this movie , let alone how to get into it . i am going to have to watch this thing until the morning when i wake up and think about getting on a plane to california and having my vacation from this world over .|0
This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(John Candy)to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then I honestly don't like him at anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed.|1
amazing , amazing , amazing . what more can be said ? jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the screen . when i first read this piece it was just one of many other movies i saw as an undergraduate student . and even though we did not really understand each other at that point in our lives i am sure there were a few nice stories about me who were interesting enough to interest us . no one had seen me yet . i must admit that i have seen some of these films and enjoyed most of them . they were good .|0
"I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through. It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the ""good bits"" taken out. Bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: ""He's hot."" ""He has a girlfriend."" ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" ""No."""|1
Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting cast.Never saw this one before - am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs over the threshold. If I continue watching, it will be just to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper.But after reading the other viewer comments, I'm not very optimistic.The opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously done in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous.|1
ohmygawd ! ! ! the magic garden is perhaps one of my most vivid ' 70s childhood memories . two hippie chicks from a trailer park are in love and there is no way i am going to let that get out of hand again . what happened to this movie ? why did this movie become such an issue with the entire population of new york city , or the united states ? it would be bad to see this movie on a first date . i do not have any particular liking for anything that involves sex , but i could say that it has its moments , which include a lot of sexual activities .|0
"then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . i got the first part with the spanish version but the second one is a little bit worse . it 's boring and takes place in a small town on the north shore of the sierra foothills . there was a big party at a house near the mountains where two guys are having an "" incident "" while driving their car down the road . not all of the people there were young and attractive looking . most of them were drunk and acted stupid . some of them just looked scared and did n't know what to do or say ."|0
i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie . i actually ran across this movie by accident . i mean , really . it 's amazing how quickly you find out a bunch of new people are coming in for the show . there are about twenty other people on stage and i could guess that any of them were there to try and get a glimpse of the film . when i saw this movie , my brain turned to mush . i was totally into the idea of all of this , but now i 'm not sure what to do with anything .|0
this is a really silly job of miscasting - - about as bad as hepburn playing a chinese woman in dragon lane . i mean we all know this movie is not a good one . i am disappointed because i thought we were working hard on this movie . it was actually very easy and made a lot of interesting films , although not for the reason you think . if you did n't read that movie you would not have noticed what it was about . so now i am getting ready to go home to get some sleep .|0
"Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever for leaving. The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming ""Exterminate"" then)."|1
this movie reminds me of ' eternal sunshine of the spotless mind ' and ' garden state ' not because of content , but because i really like these films . you may find that most people like to watch the unoriginal movies they see when they look at the pictures on the walls . there is no way in hell a person can watch this movie for more than five minutes without being depressed or depressed . if it does make you want to just jump up and give a thumbs up , you must be prepared to suffer through a hundred hours of mediocre comedic review .|0
one of the best , lackawanna bluesgreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those movies that should be written for a few more decades , and it is not . i have to ask you , why so many people who want to film this are allowed to make these films ? this is ridiculous . all of the actors - they just look like they have lived here for ten years . if only there was some sort of explanation for why so many of these films were made . i do n't think anyone has been in the theater in over twenty years .|0
if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film , i would have told you it was a bad one . as it is , it only took about 20 minutes . in addition , at the rate this movie is going , this movie is almost over . the credits are pretty low so i am not even sure what the ending is when the plot comes together . then , i went and found an empty room and got my laptop . that was very disappointing . i had to look through all of the videos but there is still no answer , which i think is great for me .|0
if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie ( grumpy ogre , annoying donkey , cute kitty ) you would know what it was for . no wonder i had never seen this movie . i must have passed out at some point because when i woke up someone had been in the living room talking to me about how bad the movie was . they told me i was making too much fun of their movie , that i should just turn it down and leave them alone , but i wanted to see it anyway . i saw this film a few years ago and it was awful .|0
This movie was painfully awful. Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods, walking thru the woods, or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two kids who discover two 'horribly mutilated bodies' in the woods, return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really really night, its dusk, its pitch black, its day. All the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind.|1
jingofighter i agree with some of your comments , but i have to disagree on a couple of things . what if the whole story were true in some way ? what if the people that lived in this region are not who they appear to be ? how would it be possible for them to make a movie based on what is really there ? why do people get so angry when something is wrong with an entire movie ? why do people hate everything and anyone that they see ? i mean no one is doing anything to help people in this country . why do people hate each other ?|0
i recently viewed a copy of this ( under the title ' eaten alive ' ) talk about dreadful ! any person who claims to be a movie star would think that they are just joking . as a matter of fact , we have found out quite many more horrible things from movies like this than anyone has known . let me go first and try to remember them all . in my day it was a simple , boring documentary on the world war ii special operations team that fought a battle between saddam hussein and his own government in vietnam .|0
"Not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie. Gunshot effects are downright horrible. Acting is ""meh"" It is nothing like Far Cry, other than names and the very basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting are completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in northern-ish America in the movie).I loved playing Far Cry. I loved the story and setting."|1
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice.|1
"the giant claw is in fierce competition with films like , ' robot monster ' and ' plan 9 from outer space . ' what about this ? "" he continued to stare at it for a second , then shook his head .

i was laying in bed , flicking through the channels . . . and boy do i have channels . . . 500 of them , all of which are boring as heck . there are a lot of stories about what happens when we become adults , but then again how much of a waste of time does it take to figure that out ? anyway , i could use some help from someone with experience on this thing . i am not going to ask for more than just one hour because i do not want to sound pathetic . please let me finish before you make any judgments .|0
i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel bored and left out . i have to say , as i look down at this scene , i am not quite sure that i would have liked to watch the movies because i could not figure out how to make sense of the ending . after watching this movie with my wife for awhile , i discovered that although the characters in it all seemed so interesting , it was a little like watching a film about a young couple who lives on a lonely mountain road .|0
"although i do n ' t like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago , i still do n't like it . i have to sit through the second half of this movie with my mouth hanging open and am not allowed to say a word . the character who is in the middle of an act does n't make sense . i ca n't stand that guy because he makes me sick . when i watch this movie i find myself thinking , "" how could he ever be in a bad comedy ? how could any of these people get into such a horrible movie ?"|0
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary, then later felt different about it, I would return and make known my change of heart. So far, this is the first time it's happened. I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a tad surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner.|1
i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many people in the history of cinema . i mean it ! i have never seen so much pornography in my whole life as this . i ca n't even explain to you just how awful this film is or where it 's supposed to come from . for example , what was the movie called in those days ? oh , i did not watch it at all . but i will show you one of the most embarrassing and hilarious movies of the century . why am i talking about this again ?|0
"In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called ""stickers"". TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting."|1
never i have seen a movie so terrible that i ' ve gone insane . it was a huge waste of credits , but the book was hilarious ! this movie was like a classic from the fifties and eighties . it was so bad that in the end he had to come up with another plot . this is the sort of movies where you want to know exactly what happened because you just ca n't help but look for some explanation as to how people can change their lives so easily . the worst part about the movie is that there are all kinds of weird things going on during the movie .|0
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star, and the Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American Version and a few European Versions, they end half way through Fist of the North Star which is about as far as the movie goes.The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short.|1
if you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting , jokes , props , and movies of the genre as you think you do , you will be amazed by how little people actually care about what is going on in those movies . this movie has some good parts , but it really sucks . most of the shows i watched last week were more than depressing . there was one thing that kept getting me to try something new . i got to watch one of my father 's favourite movies when i was a kid , he told me it would bring me back home to visit my mother .|0
i wo n ' t bore you with any synopsis , chances are you already know them . and hopefully you are not in the market for a new one . ) so what will it be then ? well , there is this guy who wants to get his hands on my sister . because of all of the time she spends with him over the last year , we had to go into our home town of waska to find out what happened . he does not want to be seen with her or talk with her .|0
there needs to be a 0 / 10 option for bilge like this . it was painful to watch , but strangely easy to do . i mean how else can anyone make it to the top of the food chain ? i could n't imagine what the other people would do if they made it to the top of the food chain after having been up there before . i only watched the movie a little while before deciding that it was no use and just sat through the whole episode . however , i enjoyed it tremendously .|0
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not ""relevant"", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely ""A Good Thing"" as Martha Stewart(appropriately)would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this film and Dennis Morgan perfectly compliments her. Both of them have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z."|1
"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good."|1
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent.|1
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget.|1
"as embarrassing as it is to admit , i was listed as production manager on this film . . . my very favorite movie for the last 20 years . . . it was really good , and the characters were really nice , but their portrayal is a total letdown . i just feel like they do not care about me at all .

I have just seen Today You Die. It is bad, almost very bad.1) The direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad.2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful.|1
As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored.|1
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard living and hard working. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young upstarts of New Labour.|1
in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations , blade is by far one of the best realised films that we have seen at this time in any genre . i have to admit it 's a bit different to what they use on movies ' rom - coms ' , but not necessarily so much . you get a nice picture of a couple of men and two women with a woman on their shoulders , and then they are dragged away by some sort of beast . how awful ! where is this movie coming from ?|0
i did n ' t understand the people who rated it over 5 . i think it ' s a horrible film from some awful hollywood movie where nobody knows who the composers are . so i was able to get a peek of the title and see if i could find any other reference to them . there is really nothing particularly interesting about those two movies because they both were filmed at the same time , so that ' s the way it should have been . the worst part of it is that i don ' t even remember writing down the parts that were written on that book .|0
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie. This is deep movie, a pondering of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts (and other who used him) have certainly affected our lives.|1
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill."|1
A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast. Not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. Just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. Not one of director Roger Corman's best.|1
i can see what this film was intending to do . unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal . you can see why i left out the best part of the movie because as i say , there is a lot of plot that needs to be worked out . in the end , it all went very well . we saw some good scenes and i had a feeling that this one was going to be a big flop . the movie was so much fun , i could n't believe how they made it go bad . oh well .|0
` ` my blue heaven ' ' is boring . the plot is insipid ; the characterizations and dialogue stink ; the actors do n't have any idea how to act . i guess i did this for fun - i thought i was funny , but i was a total loser at the movies . as long as i get to sit in front of the tv with just two guys on tv , it 's ok by me . the main reason i like acting so much is that it keeps my mind off things ( like the fact that i am being filmed by a couple of guys ) .|0
20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around . never has a movie surpassed the number of films i have read , which are far too many to account for . this movie was one of the worst films i had ever watched . not only did they end up taking out my career and turning it into a movie made by people who believed in movies , but also the plot and the plot were all wrong . even the dialogue with the movie was inaccurate . what really threw me is that the film was as bad as anything i have seen since i started reading the papers .|0
OK, a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining. Could be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet... This film is the bizzaro negative version of that. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' Film producer. Shatner played crazy yet likable, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You'll actually see the boom come down in one scene.|1
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'.|1
"1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled ""Hairspray"" but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone."|1
This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince.|1
"I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is ""Airborne"". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie."|1
One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the scenes...Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow.|1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene.|1
Look, don't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON! I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I am sorry to be so harsh but come on!|1
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story.|1
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance.|1
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love came up after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). People!!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie. A film film. So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...Modern Love. Hmmmm.|1
okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema , and it ' s way better than i expected . there ' s too much to talk about at a cinema theater , especially for one person who doesn ' t get to see these films . the best thing about them is that nobody complains . you ' re supposed to have something to complain about . well , even if this movie is not so great , it ' s the best movie i ve seen in years . it won ' t hold my interest for long , but it has a good film .|0
"Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country, which is always the Northern part. If black people were shown this way, there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons.This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the ""clever"" farce clichés. But it's mostly tiresome. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudice.Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality. This is not funny."|1
"i love most movies and i ' m a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least watch some . i ' m going to turn in now , i ' ll see you tomorrow night . have a good time and do n't be late . "" the movie ended and she sat there for a minute before turning on the light . her phone beeped and she checked it but did not notice anything . she was just too tired to care anymore . she flopped down on the bed and looked at her phone again . there was no message ."|0
Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of Life. By the end of 19th century in a remote Japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than he, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. Henceforth in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man.|1
2001: A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things.|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I'm unjustly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story.|1
This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time).|1
"Don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier film . It`s not because this is a pointless re- film . That is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the "" remake "" of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago . The scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( But with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be thankful ."|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. That was kind of a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it.|1
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh??? - What???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version.|1
as someone who was in a pan - hellenic sorority , i was n ' t sure what to expect when i tuned into the video . it had not been that long ago but there was just so much and so little to it . this is like something out of an 80s film set . one of these things will probably be a great book for the young adult reader . the first few chapters are a lot of nothing really . the following characters were not very interesting or interesting . how did they end up in such a big movie ?|0
"this movie does n ' t even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good . it is truly terrible . i thought the premise would be a bit more creative ( and , no one in this movie wants me to name it ) . instead , we found ourselves surrounded by people trying to figure out what is really happening in the middle of an action movie . after about 30 minutes of staring at each other , i decided to speak up . 
 "" hey , who are you guys ? "" i asked , waving my arms wildly . """|0
are you kidding me ? the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the lyrics . it was a very boring show that i have to see again over and over again to get through it . there seemed to be less of an audience than before , but that is nothing compared with some of the movies i saw on tv . i can remember when i saw the movie as a kid that i always thought would be awesome . it was made for great horror movies and a huge production by the kids who were still at school .|0
i can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script : 1 . let ' s make a serial killer movie like se7en and play se7en , so you can create your own movies that do not end up in boxes on the back of a garbage truck . but for the rest of the novel it would have to be some sort of super villain , or an idiot . as it turns out , this is not such an epic film . at the end of the movie , there are about 20 different characters who get mad and fight each other over stupid things .|0
river ' s edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one . having viewed it on tv the previous day i am not sure whether or not i would recommend it to myself , but this was certainly one of my favourite films ever . although it does have its bad moments , there is one thing i love about this movie . the plot is good . the actors are nice , but they seem to lack depth . if i were still in that film i would go into business for some kind of screenplay or film - making scheme .|0
hello again , i have been thinking about this movie all my life . i saw it when i was a kid , i really loved it , and i was very disappointed in it at the time . but i could not say anything because there are many things i can say on the subject . i found that this movie was very easy , and i like how it is done so well . this movie is a real waste of money ! why would the director give me such a boring movie just because i did n't get a chance to watch it before i came here ?|0
right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo . beautiful scenery , beautiful sets of famous people from the american and japanese worlds who seem to be enjoying it so much . then a very strange thing happens - one of the characters tells someone else how he will help them get out of their ' bad marriage ' when they go to see a horror movie together . then another guy gets into his ex - fiancee 's body with no warning . that is something that i really do not care for .|0
"but it ' s not . the plot is n ' t all that bad , the actors are n ' t all terrible so you could do better in this movie because you really would like it . i guess a lot of people feel like they had nothing to do with the film . some people see the movie and want to stay out of it but there are always a few "" problems "" that will come back at you when you try to get back to reality . as a writer , i can ' t blame them for their desire to make money ."|0
"we sought out this hard - to - find vhs after watching two excellent merchant - ivory pictures back to back . knowing it was an expensive film , i just bought it for £ 160 . i thought this might make the documentary more interesting than the movie itself . "" what do you mean by the film ? there was a lot of other things to watch that did n't include that . i only saw about half of it , because i was too busy being depressed over how badly my life had been changed to understand what happened ."|0
from the crash of the opening theme , ` ` the man with the golden arm ' ' is classic 1950 ' s . but i guess that was a bad idea on my part : i would have thought we had already been through this one . there are some people who will like to get back to their old roles as entertainers and editors . . . or they would rather play something else . . . . but i never got to watch the first movie , and i wanted to see this one for myself .|0
"reba sucks . it sucks hard . it ' s about this awful country singer attempting comedy . they might as well just say , "" you got a job and you hate it . "" i know what this is about but i really thought it would be fun to do something else . one of the things that i like about living here are the sounds of the piano playing . i love that there is only one key on the piano . after the first minute i was bored and tried to enjoy the music , but it didn ' t take much to turn my mind off in order to watch it ."|0
what some hollywood - movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) who are able to communicate with others on the earth by their thoughts or actions , and people that are actually capable of connecting with others through this . i read this book at least five times a week since it was written for me as a child . i have never seen anything quite so good in my young adult life ! i really enjoyed this movie , but not too much , because it seems so far removed from my usual horror films .|0
This movie was boring. Very much like Underworld, only even less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. The lead couple were boring. I totally didn't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the film. The plot was paper thin. The transformations were basically nil. I did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, I would have liked that better. I wouldn't recommend this movie.|1
"This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid-80's I taped this movie (when VCR's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, he looks wonderful and has no affecting ""acting-isms"" (see ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" to know what I mean about that!!). I measure all his performances against this one. He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends."|1
this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating . if you ' re trying to impress some guy , please save it for after - hours . and do n't even think about being cute with an old lady . the only thing in it is a bad sitcom , which is exactly how this movie will go . i had to sit through this on more than one basis because my father was a very good actor . actually , i have to confess that it did not even look good . it looks terrible !|0
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I work in the wine business, I had been quite eager to see this documentary, and I wasn't disappointed. Reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten hour series of the film on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing it). The bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long.|1
"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic ""popular"" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to ""parodies"" of HARRY POTTER."|1
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. Half the scenes are pointless. There is not an inkling of character development. The score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie yet I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances.|1
peter watkins ' rarely seen punishment park is a brutality - laced , uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape of crime . so it has been described as terrible . but what really strikes me is that the whole movie was made in 1956 . i do n't know any of these people , no one from the film . i have only read some of the things there . however , i am very certain that the plot was written in an attempt to keep the world from coming to an end . when it all started happening , i felt a little uneasy at first .|0
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks.|1
they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it work . i just had to ask if she was an idealist when it came to women , or would she be more cynical ? in the latter category as well as the later one , there are only two possible solutions : either this film was set up by someone on tv and has made its way into the mainstream market ( that could be pretty good for them ) or it was made accidentally by somebody who really does n't like women enough to want to take the chance of getting mixed up with them .|0
mario van peebles tries to go the jean - claude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol from an operation he is sworn to protect . at first there was a real chance that they would be captured or killed , although i had been warned not to trust any of the guys who are involved . but these guys just seemed like decent guys . then again , this could be all just some guy playing a prank to see how long i could keep them on their toes . the only thing i could find out was where the money came from , what it was worth , etc .|0
Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this film? It is pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed for Yash Raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.This is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie I have ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do.|1
Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it.|1
"""Jefferson in Paris"" is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way he was, the film seems to say. End of sentence, end of movie, the door's behind you.After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow)."|1
this was hitchcock ' s third hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of comedy . as far as i understand , he went through the entire series at just over six hundred credits . his style was similar to my own in some regards , but not as well . what makes these two films look so different from each other ? is it the fact that they both play the same character ? it sounds more like an amateur movie than anything else , and i do n't see how such a thing could happen . maybe this is the sequel .|0
Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters.|1
"Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.While I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, ""Nurse Sherri"" is really not all that bad."|1
this is an excellent film , but momento ( nolan ' s other big budget film ) is much better . and the critics are even more bad than the first movie . as you know , they have made many errors over the past few weeks - some of them downright unflattering . in fact , i saw one show when a bunch of kids were playing around in the playhouse at home . i did n't think it could be that bad so early in the game , but then again , i am not good at any kind of art .|0
"I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic ""Forbidden Planet,"" Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine a sailor? ), even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I guess he was a red herring, like Pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank."|1
after their star cross - country runner dies after a race , the members of a track team are stalked and killed . it is a tragedy for the rest of the band but not so tragic that it makes them want to stay away from the place . this film was filmed on tv in san diego , california , about five months ago . i thought it was great , even though most of the action was on the main screen . the first thing we saw were two people running through the water . there was blood and gore all over the place , and the poor couple must have been terrified .|0
this film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at cinequest in the big california theatre in san diego . and , of course , the rest of the film was much more boring than i 'd ever imagined it would be . how can a movie be boring when there are so many strange things going on ? what is that stuff supposed to be about ? just let me have my moment - i do n't want to go to sleep . i could never understand why anyone would put themselves through the hell of having to live through the suspense of trying to figure out what they ' d done wrong .|0
"A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with J.G. ""Pat"" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson concocted the ""gore effects"" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis movies in the late 60s. Lewis remarks that whereas 2,000 MANIACS was a ""five gallon"" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the Lewis-Patterson productions were ""fifteen gallon"" pictures."|1
Eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. This movie shows a good aspect on the human body being God's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. Actress/model Inger Ebeltoft's impersonation of Eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress being Eve.|1
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight.|1
This is the Australian TV series. It is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and song just fantastic. The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that.|1
"OK, so I gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was precisely its trailer.At the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself ""no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes"" while i rolled my eyes in shame."|1
I tried watching this movie, but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part.|1
"I like ""Hack."" Think the ""Lone Ranger"" reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver, a decent but flawed guy, in Philadelphia doing his best, while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past, and you've got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding ""Silver"" in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly, without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average."|1
"No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or ""Big Paulie"" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, ""This Thing Of Ours"". Thankfully, the ""Eddie Monroe"" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized Paul's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. Out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future."|1
Contains Major Spoilers, on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid.Predictable schlock from the start, and if that weren't enough, the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been. For example: will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dim as we go to a commercialand the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane!|1
Low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The alluring Tania Frankenstein(Sara Bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux.|1
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through!|1
oh my god . . . where to begin ? ` ` chupacabra terror ' ' is one of the worst b - horror movies ever . i mean , it has absolutely nothing to do with the first two and a half minutes that i watched about this movie . i swear i am so not used to this movie . when you get back to england , you will know exactly what it looks like . for the last two days i have watched it over and over again . well , it seems to be doing fine .|0
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout."|1
Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of television. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. I really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot.|1
Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim.|1
stanley stupid ( tom arnold ) and his wife , joan , like to sleep in bed with their heads close together . when they can see each other it makes me sad . i mean , really . the people that do all this really should have at least heard about the plot . why would you want them to know about the plot ? there is nothing wrong with the plot . it is only bad comedy . a good horror novel could have been a lot better . if only someone would read the movie . the main characters are terrible .|0
the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), characters names change (Claire or Sara?). It is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. If it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG.|1
not really all that much to this movie . . . either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a great story line , and one that is just as believable as any of the others in this film . what i need to see is if you like it . i mean , when i was growing up i always wanted to be a horse trainer . i still think about racing every single day of my life but never get around to it . the first time i ever got into a race was in high school . it was in the last week of summer vacation .|0
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt.|1
i was once a big olsen fan . i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost every weekend . there were two movies here with me in them . one is a romantic comedy , the other is an old western action - film . both movies were bad , but since i was thirteen , i had no choice but to watch them . my mother did n't give up on her love of romance novels at all , and i do not think she would have allowed herself to go into too many of those things anyway . they are great ones , i really like these .|0
...and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. Some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. A lot of people think Troma's Terror Firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but I'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck.|1
this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i ' ve seen in a long time . it ' s marketed as as sci - fi and is supposed to make me feel bad but i really don ' t feel sorry for them . i think they ' re doing pretty good for themselves . the plot is boring , the plot is unimaginative , the script is stupid and the plot is dull . the dialogue is all wrong and the plot seems totally useless . why would they want to work with those people when they could be doing what they do ?|0
it ' s schmaltzy , but then what else did you expect ? the heroine is cinderella ' s younger sister complete with a butler who can ' t get his hands on her father ' s money or take her anywhere without her parents ' permission ? well , i didn ' t want to see this film ! and that ' s okay because it ' s very good . of course , we all wanted to watch it . if it didn ' t do anything but make us all feel like kids again in 1936 , i wouldn ' t be here .|0
any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i have n ' t seen or from her early movie career is a possibility . i do know that she was an actress and had some talent , so i can not imagine what it would be like to be at a high school dance club and have someone try to steal your best friend away . the fact that she did not take off with her boyfriend says that she could have , but decided to stay because she never wanted to go back to school . my mother has no one to blame but herself .|0
"Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and "" Big "" John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film."|1
yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks - the classic ` ` godfather ' ' and yet another case of over - hype due to the fact that this is a classic film from 1927 . but i was just looking at it as a way to escape the monotony . i wanted to enjoy it . i could hardly stand it . but there was something very interesting about it . what if these characters ( and the movies ) were actually part of an original series ? what if they were somehow part of a group of people trying to protect the world from aliens , or some such nonsense ?|0
krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is , perhaps , not understandable for the ` ` rest of the world ' that follows this movie . although i am a big fan of the action and suspense thrillers , this film is quite uncool . it gives me a little feeling of claustrophobia to see so many different characters in the same room with one another . nevertheless , it 's hard to resist . after all these movies have been shown they are not very original . when i first saw this movie i was sure it was some sort of terrible horror movie .|0
i ' m going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here . first is from the view of an actor who has just left a very important party that he ' s supposed to be there for . not only that , but his new girlfriend was there . it ' s such a shame when people are forced to go through such an awful situation . do they really need to watch this movie in their own home ? and how did she get to be one of them ? why doesn ' t my parents help her ? what kind of sicko is she ?|0
"oh yes , i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash . but please , i must be honest here : i do not know if this is even the same girl . it was only when i found out that it had been her that i could think of a way to make this movie more than it is . i just never imagined the type of video that would go viral on the net ! and what is she doing in the movies anyway ? i did not realize that she has so many fan - clique comments . """|0
this production of hamlet , prince of denmark is by far the best that i have seen . although it was quite an unimpressive piece in the first part , the second part has made it even better . the scene is so well done that i do n't want to be a fan until i am allowed to go see it . for some reason , i felt like it would be entertaining to watch it with my friends . but now , i am not so sure . i know it will make me feel like i am being cast as an actor rather than a performer .|0
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want. I as a fan did not want a 1920's Evil Nazi movie. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, as we don't REALLY know what became of her. I also would have liked to get Ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing.|1
Set in the Philipines, Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work.|1
`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.'|1
"I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, ""Destined to be the next stoner classic"", hardly.Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on."|1
"I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: ""'Deed Poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes."|1
"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, and anime all at once. The robots are actually called ""replicants"", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for ""heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal""....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films."|1
ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability.|1
I usually don't categorize a moving as boring. I am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. Unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. Terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience.|1
i very much enjoyed this movie and i think most fans of lauren ambrose will too . her character is so good - looking that she is considered an easy sell . when i was young , i would have liked to see how the movie went . but now i understand why people wanted to watch it . as you will find out soon enough what a lot of other great stories are worth . at least the characters were interesting . also , they are not exactly bad actors . they do seem to enjoy their role , but it does seem like they are genuinely concerned for their fellow person .|0
I simply cannot understand how any Who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here.|1
as i said , sometimes low budget is good . you get to see a good movie without a lot of bad stuff going on . if it were n't for the constant criticism from my friends , i would have been in the same position . how could i have ever allowed myself to be tricked into seeing this movie ? all right , maybe i just let myself get distracted by the movies because i thought i was doing something right . i got bored at the end and then went back to watching . but i still wanted to play some more .|0
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another Hollywood CG/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable whatsoever. Designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of Theodore's butt.This film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed for the worse for this movie.|1
very good film . very good documentary . very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted people they were . it just shows how well the government has grown in the years since i first watched it . it 's a shame that this film failed . i loved the way the story was made . but then there were other reasons for doing this . we have been told that you could not be too much of a fool if you do not let things unfold like this . i guess you will have to find out for yourselves what the actual plot is all about .|0
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK, I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN’S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets! ), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)!|1
right up ( or down ) there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace . the premise sounded cool enough , but it took a little work for me to finish it . so i could n't believe it when i read the script for the second time in less than three years . i have spent a lot of time editing this movie , so i was expecting something better . i think that some of the scenes here were more original than the other movies . this film takes place in a small , poorly lit alley , between two crumbling buildings .|0
Oh boy. Films like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close to truth, then I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a time before WWII started. In the movie, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Well I can't imagine that Rommel wouldn't have known something about Hitler's government policies so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life at the end a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him?|1
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing.|1
i would n ' t recommend this to anyone , except cinema - goers who like to laugh at a film , not with a camera . so if you want to enjoy the film and find yourself enjoying it as well , now is the time to go for it ! what we have in mind is quite different from the movies we have on dvd . of course , the main story here is just that - an actual movie . i am not a fan of films of any sort . i never wanted to watch this one .|0
a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment . this is all very interesting and the plot is not really that exciting either . to start off a short story you would think it would be a little too much , but we found that it was really quite interesting . also i had to spend some extra time writing down some things because they look so good and i want to make a huge contribution . if you are still interested in hearing this film please let me know .|0
a horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe - bendingly poor delivered pc cliches ad nauseam ( races working together ) . i have never seen a classic movie like that one in my whole life . this is the second thing i was thinking about when i bought this . it 's not really an original plot , but i could n't find anyone who would have ever chosen this kind of production . you can only imagine what the first couple were doing with this film . so why are they giving it to us ? we should be making more credits .|0
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning. Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor.|1
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.Turd.|1
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (A real acting stretch...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sells!) however when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) ""Battle of the tough guys"" who's champion Zeus (Played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital."|1
as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood . in the scene where the dog grabs the camera and points it at an iconographic figure , the first thing to pop into the viewfinder is that the protagonist takes the dog 's paw and puts it down with his left hand . there are three other movies i have yet to see on film , both black and white . you get the picture - but how do you even know which is which ? one movie i have seen is not enough . i need to be able to understand some things about these films .|0
there ' s something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some cheech and chong material . one of the worst elements , however , comes from a lack of common sense . i mean , this is a great movie on the richter scale , but it never gets any easier . i know that it ' s supposed to be an educational experience , but as it turns out , it ' s no fun at all . what really irritates me with this movie is the amount of time involved . i couldn ' t get anywhere with its content .|0
Unlike one of the reviewers below, I don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. Whereas it is good to see a British director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex.|1
movies seem to fall into two categories : films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs , and those that do n't , which are so badly written they make no sense ( i was only able to see it this afternoon with my eyes closed for the second time in an hour . when i read the reviews of all the books i feel bad for reading them , since they were good ones . i thought i would find a lot of relief after reading the final chapters , but i can not be sure because i did not see the actual ending until now .|0
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone X File that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to.|1
"i saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic , and i must admit that it whetted my appetite to see it in action . let me tell you about the first film i saw , "" said a large bearded man standing over a group of kids playing dominoes . "" it was awful . the actors were all pretty cool . it was a real horror movie . so much so that i do not know where i am going with this . i can not remember which movie i like better , the new york times or the 1980s ? it was just awful ."|0
Okay, that was just brilliant. I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong. It really needed more episodes like this. The cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. Writing was fantastic and so was the editing. Great job in all accounts. The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. Which is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but failed until now. The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being this good.|1
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. Davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St.|1
if you ' re looking for a movie that ' s fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the characters in it . i don ' t even want to contemplate why this film has been allowed to come here . when you ' re on an island somewhere where people live and enjoy themselves , there is not much else worth watching . however , i can see that this movie is just another example of how bad life can get . maybe it doesn ' t have to be perfect but it ' s all there is . the first few days were good .|0
"""Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable"", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries, it is stunningly photographed, directed with lurid enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist."|1
well , i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now in the possession of my sister . i could have made this film if it were truly good but i had no idea who the owner was when i first saw this film and i found out later that it was an amateur production with nothing to recommend it . even the movie did little to put me over the top . i mean , how many times do you go through a whole film for a single piece of film and not realize what really happened ?|0
gracie ( minnie driver ) , a woman in her late twenties , is on a waiting list for a job . and this is how i am feeling . the only reason i agreed to this is because i wanted to see if there might be a good opening spot for it . when i saw it , i just could not believe what i was looking at . it was one of those long lines where the lines seem like they went on forever and then suddenly they 're cut by a high - speed bullet gun . i found that the movie was supposed to be based on film noir movies .|0
chick flick ? of course . . . . been done before ? many times . . . . predictable ? yes . . . . . worth watching ? well , no , this movie is just not a good idea , the plot is so much worse than all those other cinematic flicks ever were . my point is that i 've seen it before , and even though i 'm not very interested , i still want to see what else is going on . maybe if i get some time to go over the video , i might start to believe it .|0
gene roddenberry never let his fans down . his death ended sci - fi legacy that will never be matched . earth is not only one of those stories , but is a very interesting and entertaining fantasy . the story of roddenberry ' s daughter and the life she led has always made me laugh . now , i do not like this version of this movie ( it was so predictable ) but i can see that some of the characters seem to be good actors . i find myself missing all the fun in the movie when they start talking about their own lives .|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori. That might be true but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced.|1
"Hearkening back to those ""Good Old Days"" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole Season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. (We can't recall just whose it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former ""Little Tramp' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds of his being an ""undesirable Alien""."|1
ok , last night i saw the world premiere of paul schrader ' s the exorcist : the beginning at the end . i have seen this movie hundreds of times , and knew absolutely nothing about what had happened in the theatre . for the time being , i just did n't care enough to really pay attention . as i told you , it is a good film . i also felt that the opening credits were all wrong , so i thought it best to skip through them on my way home . the first few minutes were quite boring but i eventually settled into the role of a professional .|0
"Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother/Daughter Estrangement, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really ""sells"" their roles."|1
"Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the ""magic"" transcends all that other stuff."|1
the subject matter was good , direction was ok . mohanlal was efficient in his role as a major . the main reason is that there are many other things i did not have time for because of this . first off , my mother - in - law was very sad about what i had to do . however , she was able to recover quite quickly and it was an easy life . it is only at times that the pain begins to return and when it does the feeling of emptiness becomes unbearable . but once you start to really get attached to it , it starts getting difficult .|0
"In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited ""peekaboo"" hairstyle. She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring screen successes in films like ""This Gun For Hire"" and ""I Married A Witch"". She held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in ""So Proudly We Hail"". But changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over."|1
i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie . there ' s a lot of stuff in there about some sort of war , and i didn ' t care to watch any more . you know , i did not pay much attention this weekend , but i don ' t remember much about it . the movie doesn ' t give me much hope either . i just watched it because it was pretty good . i found out that one of these guys from the marines was an ex - soldier who lived in vietnam and had been sent out to get killed by the viet cong .|0
"Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a film. This looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.The ""talents"" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. I live in Malaysia, BTW.Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. And unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked."|1
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
the film is a pathetic attempt to remake ingmar bergman ' s ` ` autumn sonata ' ' ( 1978 ) starring ingrid michaelson . but this film will never have had its original content . it ' s not good , and i ' ve spent the last year trying to figure out the best way to get some more of the old stuff back into production . however , it didn ' t take long for me to come up with one . first , there are too many questions . how much do you ' ve got left ? what is the most interesting movie you can think of in this collection ?|0
There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak.|1
"I'm an action movie fan but until today I've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" on pay-TV hoping for nothing special.But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.The transformation of Samantha/Charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I've ever seen."|1
"I am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their ""problems"" all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). ""Hack"" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good histories. I just love it!! I hope ""Hack"" will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change."|1
I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp-fun?|1
my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival . it was great . stormy is very popular with the guys and they like her because she is so beautiful . i got a few compliments from other girls who wanted to know if we were going to see them later that weekend , and then i told them i wanted to go out for pizza and not to worry about getting in trouble . i do have a strange feeling in my stomach that i am having a panic attack when i realize i have done this again . i had no idea what to expect from this movie .|0
tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover are good enough to make a convincing film . in this film , what you see is just very bad . no plot , no acting , and absolutely no style - all that can be seen on any given night . how many movies have you watched where there was no ending ? this one looks pretty lousy . it 's an old comedy by robert boyer , which only made it last a little longer . my wife , beth , loved this movie .|0
a snore gore . i saw this piece of horrible , stinking , worthless , junk at the cameo movie last week . that 's how much i like it , and no one knows it better than i do . if i had the money i would buy this movie . you ca n't even find $ 10 in this dump . my job is to track down a good movie producer who has been on the force for over a year now - but only because he does not want to show people how to use their movies . this film is pathetic !|0
Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it.|1
i am very disappointed because i expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews . the script is not really very good at all , and i think most of the scenes will have to be more interesting than this . you guys make me so happy ! i can not believe how little i have seen of this movie ; i must say that it feels like i spent a good chunk of last night watching an awful movie . the plot was quite bad , and the plot was too stupid . the overall picture was horrendous , and had to be read for a long time , but it was funny nonetheless .|0
regarded as another one of the recent over - the - top drama ' s brought upon us by hollywood , this movie excels where nothing else ever happens except for a few minutes in a film that does n't happen in real life . i know it is an unfunny film with just the right ending , but still it is very funny . i would like to think that it has all been staged out of kindness and love , but i am disappointed . what do you want from these movies ? are they really so bad ?|0
This movie strayed too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely made it to the middle of the film. Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was trash. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the Chowder Society members either. Hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime.|1
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film.|1
"Sorry about that. But if you have seen this ""epic"", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but I do know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the Earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways."|1
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. The lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. I had seen it when it first came out on TV. Once more it aired when I had a VCR, but I did not have a chance to tape it. Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) I feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn.|1
"What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not that much. With the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. None of which were funny. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the ""zany"" one-liners."|1
"This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen. Probably ""Okul"" is the first turkish horror film. I must say that I were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. This shows that turkish film improves itself by time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, It was really successful."|1
this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches . sadly it was obvious throughout up until our first film that it was no different from those films we see at blockbuster flicks . i will never understand the difference between my life as a young boy and the real world as a film director . if one has not seen horror movies before , how can one believe that you have seen this movie ? the film itself is nothing more than a farce made up to frighten kids into doing something that they did not mean to do .|0
"""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie. But if ""Lifeboat"" (wich unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time (the early 40's) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, not discovering this film isn't really a lost.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it's rather hard to find the Hitchcock's touch."|1
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story pulled me in and held my attention. i will definitely watch this again and again. this true story telling at it's best... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz. i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise.|1
"Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. ""Kay Hoog"" reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first ""Dark Knight""- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent."|1
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.Yeah, it is.A patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time period covered was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book.|1
it beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly . it is no understatement to call it far more interesting than this . although i have been through most of this in the past two years , i thought that if it were only a few more minutes , maybe i could actually make it through this movie , but i am wrong . the show is not nearly so good as i expected . the worst part with this film is when the actors try to act like they are doing something else ; it makes no sense .|0
this is an adaptation of an edith wharton work , whose writing is amazing . sadly , this movie never made the rounds in any of the major publishing and media outlets . you can be sure there are only a handful of movies with such a great script . no one will ever buy it , so i am very disappointed to see how much better it was at the time . however , what really bothered me about this film is the fact that it was so unwritten . i have read many books , but never saw one like this .|0
"` ` hardbodies 2 ' ' is harmless , aimless and plot less . i would add ` ` brainless ' ' to that list , but as far as i can tell , it has a long track record of failure . you see , all of my work is for nothing , and i 've already said too much , so if you are interested in the final product , please look me up here on amazon - "" 
 there was a soft hiss at the other end of the connection . "" what is it now ? "" asked laura . "" hello ? "" no answer ."|0
this movie twists the facts of anne and mary ' s lives into something unrecognizable . to make mary boleyn , anne is a very good actress , which makes her much more likable . as far as the others , it does not seem that there is much else to say about them , and they are so bad that i just do n't know what to think anymore . on the other hand , i really hate the idea of people who are in love with each other getting divorced because of someone else ' s decision to break up .|0
i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung . the acting was over the top and the plot was boring . even if you are one of the funniest characters ever , that is not to say it was not a wonderful movie . the ending was somewhat horrible but it did not really come off as much fun . the actors seemed to be completely incompetent and there was no hope for an action film . i got to the main point where i started thinking maybe we should go out to a bar to watch some movies . then everything became a total bore .|0
it ` s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read a chapter ' s first novel , i began to be sick . so i turned in my books to someone who wrote that movie and made me vomit on the floor . this movie was just too awful for me to watch . if i had seen it yesterday , i wouldn ' t even think about viewing it again ! instead , i left it on a special dvd shelf which i could never find . it was the worst movie i ever saw .|0
(This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever.|1
i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor , but this ` ` movie ' ' left me stunned in the face of the entire genre . i ca n't seem to move my mouth , and so i just lay back on my bunk and watched it . i do not really think any of it was worth seeing . when i had a few hours ' sleep , i went outside to enjoy some fresh air and relax . it didn ' t make me feel anything good , though , because there was absolutely no feeling in the entire movie .|0
* * * * mild spoilers _ but you probably know the plot * * * * woman gets raped and leaves her boyfriend with a few broken bones . she has to find a way to survive for awhile . when she does ... well , you can imagine how shocked i was when it all went off without a hitch . as soon as i heard about the break - up , i thought of what to do in order to protect the girl . so i spent the next few weeks trying to make a story out of nothing . i could barely contain myself .|0
"This film is all right, fairly silly and to be taken lightly. But what I can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment near the end: ""look, they all look the same"". Isn't that by far passing the good taste standards? I thought it was revolting, as were the heroic, unselfish acts by some of the people in this film. I'm not saying it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn."|1
Firstly, let me make it clear that I love aircraft, and usually any film with them in is worth watching - and I've sat through some shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this Strategic Air Command promotional film. The acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography.|1
Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car), facing hard time in the Big House with some of the nastiest characters this side of a Russ Meyer pic. Blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout, and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity.|1
at the story . it is reality mixed with americana - and very original . emily grace is a young girl tired of being in this movie , but her friends keep telling her that maybe she should have done more to save herself and her little brother , billy . as an indie film critic i know that this movie will probably never be released by the same genre , although some of the good movies are still on youtube . if you think you are getting better at this then you must have missed a few crucial pieces of the movie .|0
having lived in michigan ' s upper peninsula ( 30 miles from escanaba ) in the mid - 1990s , i was eager to get home . but that did not work out . i had to do something else . i made my way to the house on the hill and stood there for a few moments with my mouth open . after a good while of staring at the place , i went back to my car and decided to park it where it is still in the driveway . as i got out , the front door slammed .|0
the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture . it is a monument to what filmmaking once meant to be in america . some say that the creation of this film was not as much about art , but i disagree . the premise is that there are two things which really do mean something to me . one is the fact that both actors can make up for their earlier shortcomings . the other is the fact that they actually manage to make everything seem more believable . the main thing that really impresses me is how fast the actor can move with just his head moving from side to side so quickly !|0
"I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was a major reason why. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the ""straight"" role instead of the funny guy. ""Armed and Dangerous"" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter."|1
"I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS!!! !This 16mm disaster is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, a generic, over done ""plot"" and terrible dialog.In this ""Movie"" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian ""hacker chick"", the Pedophilic teacher...Blah, Blah, Blah....And then the Pumpkin Man. ""Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?"" This question is asked towards the end of the film."|1
I am a firm believer that a film, TV serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-80's on TV and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the full series DVD set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me.|1
"Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now, her book ""Breaking Dawn"" will not be first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans.Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it.She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times, she even acted like she had PTSD."|1
i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . this has been going on for about five months now and the first couple of times i thought i would never see a tv show again . but it seems to have all worked out . we still have a lot to do and then it will be off to the movies with me . when we go back to my apartment and start looking for a new home , it is n't hard to figure out what they want . there are so few people in this town and there is nothing interesting to do .|0
pretty twisted horror film , that has a few good moments here and there , with some creepy blood transfusion or two . you can take it in the car but this movie is bad . for example i saw this movie to see what was on the screen when i first saw the film and i thought , ' why not make something entertaining ? ' i tried to imagine what would have made such a bad movie as this , so i watched it for a couple days . it just did not seem funny at all . then again , it was not my worst movie ever , but this one was a little bad .|0
"you may be interested to know that barricade was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a good portion of its film , in which case we shall never have this movie . the film is not as much of a mystery as most of the others but i should say it was more than a bit bizarre . there must have been some kind of conspiracy or plot behind it . however , we have no reason to think so .

deep sea 3d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to explore . i also liked this song . it is one of my favorites but was never really mine . it is hard to believe how many people have ever heard this song . the main thing that was missing from this album is the number of reviews . it would have been nice if i could get some positive feedback for this show . the first thing i can say is that it was a cool song . i do n't know why i did n't see this when i watched it with my brother .|0
"The thing which makes ""Fire"" even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry, is its touch of femininism and rebellion. To my mind, the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife Sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy, as per the same narrative which appears in the film too."|1
a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours . the entire movie could have been made in less than one minute , and that would be a pity . as it was , i only had one night left to spend with her , which i had hoped would go well this summer . after the second half of the production , we all sat around drinking coffee and eating junk food until about eleven - thirty . i took my leave early and headed straight up to my office to get some work on my laptop .|0
"This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder, ""Where is Ralph Macchio?"" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, then Myiagi can come along and add some more! Macchio could've been the love interest for Julie in this film! Never mind!On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what Daniel's were."|1
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. Streisand wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, Streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts.|1
i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park . . . or if they have it was not the work of a decent filmmaker . i mean how many actors write something so ridiculous that it has to be put on hold for five minutes while others do it . this book is totally unrealistic ! it is an utter waste of my time ! it is so boring , and the characters seem as if they are trying to stay alive in some way . i thought there were more of them . this book is so unpromising .|0
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody like Scary Movie.|1
"I loved the film ""Eddie Monroe"". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman's. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director."|1

I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water.|1
i don't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones. when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off, but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires, a combination that i thought could not fail. That is until i popped this into my DVD player.|1
let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film . for the most part the actors appear to have no idea who they are , or why it is so funny and interesting . a couple of the guys ' names are pretty good , but not very good . none of the characters seem to be in a bad mood when they come on stage , even after they get there . one character seems to be in a coma , and the other one has only an occasional smile . it 's like someone had taken a picture of these actors and glued them to a post - script page .|0
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her. The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style, as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks, which are fairly tame, but from the weird atmosphere.|1
i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something . there was nothing . i had no knowledge of the characters or their routines that were in this film , and even if i did , my interest in it was limited by its quality . i spent hours watching them and saw nothing . then i started reading the rest of the film in an effort to find out what the story was all about . on the way home i turned around and saw a beautiful young girl with long , dark hair .|0
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful! !This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a bad name.Next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. It's like a drunken snail making its way to die.Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's the only thing that kept me watching.|1
This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.Dont come to this movie expecting the Matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie.|1
i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub - par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid . this ' s not the kind of film we saw last week . it shows a woman and a man who appear to be lovers . both are quite beautiful . if you look at this movie , it seems that she is married and has made some horrible mistakes . all in all , this is probably the worst film i have ever watched in my life . it was supposed to be a romance film . instead the acting is bad .|0
this film was a wonderful romp , intelligent , playful , mysterious , full of surprises , with humor in every sense . the story started off very well . it began with what seemed to be an average american boy trying to live his own dreams . nothing like this had ever happened in movies before and there was certainly no way to know exactly how much he loved them , or how he felt about anything else . i could tell this movie took some serious acting , but if you wanted to learn more details , you should never have left the library at all .|0
this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish . i knew we were in for a wasted night . i was just trying to find out what kind of movie he saw , if it was about anything at all , and how it got started . there was nothing on the screen but an old horror film starring a man who thinks he is in control of his world , when really he is doing a good job . the plot is very depressing . the characters are so predictable and boring that it makes you wonder why they have even made a movie as stupid as this .|0

this film is terrible . not only is the story unbelievable , the situations the characters put themselves in are downright awful . i 'm surprised to see a few of the directors and editors who actually wrote this ! these people must have taken it pretty hard when they came to live with me on the beach for a whole day . i can not imagine why the movie would go so bad . how could they possibly do something that stupid ? i think that if i had seen the movie , i would never have left my hotel room .|0
chan - wook park , you have to hand it to the guy . in my eyes , he ' s not only a great actor and an excellent photographer , he is the worst actor ever ! i ' m actually glad i was on the other side of the room from him because this movie will be just like the one where he wins the award for best actor of his lifetime . i saw this movie three years ago and thought it was terrible . now i wish i had spent more time watching it . but the film should have been good .|0
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course, I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book's author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters.|1
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes up short.------------ Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. However, the Wild Life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful (""I got Visa...Masterrrrr Charrrrge!!"")"|1
despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just in the sense that it takes up a good portion of its time , and can probably be seen from far away . i 've always found it tedious to watch films like this , especially because they have such little originality , and are so very repetitive as to seem totally uninspired . however , i was particularly surprised to learn that this film was actually pretty good , but not nearly as nice . i never expected to see this movie .|0
What an awful movie. Full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. It is hard to believe the same guys that wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of Top 10 Worst Movies of All-Time. Didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Let alone make a sequel for it!!?? Amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released!|1
there is only one reason this movie is watchable . till schweiger . he is such a good actor the characters are made to believe that he is on fire . i am in trouble , and i wish that i had stayed in my apartment all night . but i thought you would like me to take you out to dinner . i just ca n't decide if i should invite or not . i really appreciate your invitation , but it would probably have been better if i had waited till tomorrow . i love you very much .|0
Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was horrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it is a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrible.|1
if a movie ca n ' t hold your interest in the first 25 minutes , it ' s over as far as the film is concerned . so if you don ' t wish to see another movie like this , please leave well enough alone . we are here because of an interesting story involving a man that has been missing for 18 years . one day he wakes up and finds his parents dead in the house . they were killed by an assassin . when he awakes , he realizes that his parents have been murdered . he decides to try to find his father .|0

The problem I think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad ""effects"" which got me annoyed through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. This film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end."|1
"""Wagons East"" is widely known as John Candy's last movie, as he died on the set. That's just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. It's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it."|1
I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook.|1
"this film is one of my favorite christmas classics . sure , it ' s fluff , it ' s not ` ` the good movies ' but it doesn ' t make you feel any better about your family . and i know how much you love these people . that ' s why i ' ve decided to go with this movie . "" "" what do you think don ' t motivate a young lady to come out here and put herself on a pedestal ? who would have thought someone could be so stupid as to try and write down a movie like this ?"|0
this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno ( alex linz ) in a catholic school who has to leave town before the movie becomes popular . his friends seem to enjoy being around him , which is understandable when you consider how many people are doing it . after he left the church and started working on an art form that would look like a work of art if it was n't for the fact that he ' d lost most of his clothes and had to start over . no one says much because the actors just do n't really have the imagination to be witty .|0
homecoming ; what a huge disappointment ! ! after reading the plot summary ( the dead coming back to vote ) i decided to have a look at the new series , for my own reasons . in the first place it is incredibly stupid and unbecoming of the book . i just did not want to come up with such a disgusting plot line . the second thing that struck me as strange about this movie was the way they acted out the execution . there was something odd about the ending but i can only describe it as terrifying .|0
a severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing . guy rolfe , so fantastic at doing this that i ca n't believe he had the nerve to let me sit in a place like this - especially with a bunch of other students . it 's obvious he was disappointed when i did not get an opportunity to see his performance as we got on board . he just gave me a knowing look that made me wonder whether or not he was playing some sort of game . maybe he was going to pull the plug on this whole thing and leave all of us stranded here .|0
i did n ' t really hate mirrormask . i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . the main problem was , when i had the idea of doing something that made me feel at ease in my new role , i couldn ' t think of anything i liked better . it seemed to work well for me because i didn ' t want to sit on the stage and stare at the camera . i hated that movie . there are so many bad things that can happen to a tv set if someone puts too much pressure on one of its ratings .|0
the toxic avenger , hideously deformed creature of super - human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly bad reviews but also has a little good character . if it were n't for the death of my husband i could have stayed home and played with my daughters . so here 's what i can tell you : as far as this movie goes , the movie was pretty lame . nothing more than an epic romance involving two men who are in love when their wives are taken from them by aliens . the author does n't have much to say about the plot , except that the ending is really bad .|0
hellraiser : bloodline is only a so - so film . i believe it ' s the fourth installment in the hellraiser series . i ' ve read an impressive collection , and now i can see why the film has been so popular . this movie is nothing more than a waste of space . if you want to look at what other people would think about that movie , you need to be careful . there ' s something very wrong with this movie . how do you make out ? i don ' t get it because the actors are always acting funny and not being too bad .|0
when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild , get ready . you ' re in for dark , harrowing films , and the first thing you ' re going to see on a movie screen is a video diary ! ! it ' s not really a movie because i ' ve seen many movies like this , but my mind doesn ' t know which one that is . instead of watching someone with no feelings or expectations , they just sit quietly and wait for something else to occur . i found the second film a bit more daunting than the first .|0
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination. The are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. It is a film of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. There are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit in. Both Kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them. Next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up, such as the Texas Gov.|1
"ok , this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments , but there are a couple more i had forgotten about . 
 ' the plot was not bad at first . he is quite handsome , and has great taste in music , and plays a good game of guitar . when he goes out on a date with another woman , she is just too immature to give him the attention he needs . no matter what happened between them , she did not realize that he was an unfaithful lover . they started making out a lot during the movie , and it was all over before the end of the movie ."|0
or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90 ' s flicks and they just end up with more movies . i really thought i would see this as my way of taking it all back , but i ca n't . what 's going on here is something completely out of proportion to any other film i have seen so far . how can you tell that this was not a movie at all ? if you look closely , you can spot signs of character development in this movie .|0
this great film never showed up in my town , so actually i did n ' t have any opportunity to watch it . however , i do see that it has been one hell of a year . i will probably be able to get into a few of the shows now . i really love these movies and was surprised by how well it goes . even though i saw it when it was produced in 1993 , i was just as surprised about the entire process as you . there are some good things about this movie . the most notable is the sequel to this movie .|0
"Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for ""Lady Frankenstein"", a stagy, costumy Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten(""Citizen Kane"")plays the crusty old Baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-ntless European B-films, usually as Rosabla Neri, including ""Hercules Against the Moon Men"", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."|1
this horror tale takes place in the namib desert of africa . a canadian systems analyst , zach straker ( who is an avid reader ) discovers that his son - in - law and his family have been murdered and left for dead . as he reviews this movie , it gets worse . at the beginning of the film , there is nothing but a bloody mess and no bodies . then , to top things off , there is the horrible thing about being a vampire . if you want to see me writing something like this , please sign here or follow my smashwords author website .|0
"i saw this film many years ago , and absolutely hated it - - i could not wait for it to be finished . but now ? now that the movie had been released , there was no way i could change my mind about having it produced . this film is nothing like other movies in america . first , i would like to comment on the fact that i can never decide how or why you feel about a movie . of course , it might have been "" bad , "" but i found it quite entertaining ."|0
jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . he could effortlessly switch from film to action in seconds and without even blinking a single eye . i really do not know what his character looked like , but she was beautiful . there was something about her that reminded me of some of the famous actresses who had starred in this movie . she was incredibly good looking as well , with an aura of innocence and charm that made my stomach drop . she also got a lot more money than anyone could possibly spend in a month or so .|0
i kind of like jag . it do have its charm but lately its to much propaganda in it . the movie has become somewhat of a joke as well and the premise is so funny that i just couldn ' t wait for it to end . it seems like this is a bad film , but i don ' t mind because i can see why these people are still alive . i mean there ' s an amazing number of people in their right mind who would go out on a friday night again and get wasted with no thought of doing anything more serious than hanging out and watching some tv .|0
let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly anticipating this film ' s release for awhile . after finally getting the chance to get a word in edgewise and feeling satisfied , the producer told us that there was simply nothing left to write about . even so , the plot of the movie is good , very good , it seems like it has been done before . but now that you are all standing in this room listening to this production , i feel that i want to take a few moments to really enjoy the process of editing the cast and crew .|0
"this film is a very beautiful and slow film . there is nothing hollywood about it . it is very low budget with a great story , but not as good as i had expected . the acting is excellent and the scenes are extremely amusing . the main issue at the scene is that the characters are very hard - bitten , almost insincere . there is an undercurrent of criticism to be felt , even if they are somewhat unconvincing in portraying themselves as "" normal "" people . i have watched this film for four years now and ca n't believe that there is any truth to what anyone has said so far ."|0
"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow ""transplant"" donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever."|1
"One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with ""Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/Adventure Holywood movies...,"" as if those weren't reason enough to love it! Anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. See it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film."|1
I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.|1
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in.|1
being a former mst3k watcher , even i found this movie unwatchable . the awful attempts at humor - heck the awful jokes - have gone on for weeks and i was just starting to think they could n't possibly make a difference at all in this movie . what are the chances that we will actually find something like this movie again ? i would say there is no way that we will find anything quite as entertaining as this one . there is something about this book that is so creepy it takes my breath away . i can hardly believe how boring the entire thing is .|0
wesley snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess , horribly reminiscent of steven seagal ' s latest works . with the exception of two things : firstly , it was in the middle of the evening when i started to notice that the show had gone viral - as usual . secondly , it ' s not one of those sappy shows you watch on tv where an actor tells his wife how he ' s going to try to get into her pants , and this one was a movie about people being forced to make love to each other .|0
this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me . everything i hate about films is not good , and they all seem to fall flat as soon as it begins . that 's how these movies really play , so i have no desire to watch anything else . in fact i just want to be alone with my thoughts and get back to my story . i had a bit of an epiphany , and decided to put it in reverse : i ca n't actually let myself die in this movie . i must have been more depressed than i thought .|0
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn't have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys.|1
"it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it ` ` bigger than hell . ' "" he stopped for effect at this point because he did not want to be mocked by his friends or anyone . there was really no point in continuing with the dialogue . i do have one last thing to say . i ca n't wait to hear about this film . please let me know how it goes , and if you think it needs any further editing , please let me know . i will write up some comments as a collaboration with you ."|0
one of the worst films i have ever seen ! after watching it i walk out like , what happened to this movie ? why did we even get on at all . there was nothing fun about this movie and i have never seen anything quite like this film before . it just could not have been made with any other movies in the world . i can not believe this movie is actually filmed . it has to be made by someone who spends his days running around looking for aliens . i do not know whether or not you are talking about real alien spaceships .|0
"imagination must of slipped jim wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one . i do n ' t mind saying that we are at an impasse - and a great dilemma as well - for this project is very complicated indeed . if i were to say , "" ok "" , that would be quite a bit harder to say , "" ok "" because i have absolutely no idea how to explain what has just happened . perhaps it could be explained in a different form . i will leave you to ponder this as long as possible ."|0
This film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but I am not sure what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. There are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie.|1
i watched this film not knowing anything about it . i had presumed it was a sci - fi b movie of some sort . but , to be truthful , i have only seen this movie a dozen times since i bought it and that was only because they made it so bad . all the other films are similar to this one . it did n't really happen until later in the film ; it was just an old , cheap film . i am sure we can agree that it is not something that ever happened . what you see is the same as what i saw .|0
burt kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel . kennedy was a well known good writer , but he fell down on his ass and never came back to play again . you might not believe this , but if you saw kennedy around in that film you would be laughing . what happened to him was bad . it was just an awful parody of the first movie , and i have yet to read any one of kennedy ' s novels . i ca n't help wondering how many people could have done it . i do n't know if anyone ever has seen the film .|0
one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor , john carradine ' s more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist , but the real problem with this movie was how much fun he has . it really sucks ! i ca n't help but want to laugh when i read this . i mean seriously , there is nothing remotely funny or humorous about this film . i could have sworn i just watched my best friends and their parents go to sleep . i must have been an actress for a couple of days after that because i never saw this movie in the first place .|0
"This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the ""gallant"" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha! )The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. And I liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well."|1
i was very excited to see rock star because i am a big fan of mark wahlberg ' s . i really like his story and i want to know how it was written . however , you can never have too much fun with this one because he is such a bad ass . i love this book and i will read it again soon . if you enjoyed this story , please go to the back page for a review so that i can send some other people a thank you . they would like to know how great this book was as a writer , or why they liked this film so much .|0
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness . not only was it a very bad show , but at least there were plenty of interesting people in it . i spent hours watching it on every saturday night . i think it was probably the worst horror flick i had ever seen in my career and it really made me gag . the best film i ever watched is that of the wizard of oz . no , this movie was completely different . the characters were exactly as i remember them . they were just like everyone else .|0
i finally snagged a copy of kannathil muthamittal through netflix and spent new yera ' s eve watching an amazing drama about two men who are having an affair . he ' s not interested in making love to her . he doesn ' t want anyone else to be happy either . when he ' s finished with her , she turns to leave , and he runs his hands over her body , as if to try and find some kind of substance that might make her fall asleep again . instead , he just keeps rubbing her breasts and kisses her on the lips .|0
Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it is in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.Next, it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors.|1
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrised in all my life.|1
"attend the tale of sweeney todd . . . the strangest , most off - putting , but most wonderful broadway musical . it takes a lot of talent to do such a production and some of the actors ' characters are not nearly as great as the director or director himself is . i saw this with my own two eyes . i would love to hear some of what they have to say about the show , but i think you better start talking now . "" he took a long drink of his water . "" first of all , why should i talk ?"|0
this film reeks of production line planning . it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and thought that if they made a good movie they would have a better life . this film was just bad enough to keep them laughing for a time , but now it is not funny at all . why do people even bother with this film in the first place ? why are they wasting our credits ? it is too depressing to watch . there is only so many hours of film you can watch without thinking about what happened ( which i will explain later ) while watching someone else take the film .|0
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode.|1
this is one odd film . it seems to be aimed at a younger audience , but is filled with a sense of sadness that only an adult movie could provide . the character does n't even have a name . well , there were some good laughs while it was going on . my best friend and i used to watch this film over a week ago . i remember we were in the living room talking about it and we both had tears running down our faces . the plot did n't make sense . when you watch movies like this it tends to feel like your life is ending in a tragic way .|0
many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war ii on the basis of one great performance . the film will be released in about two months and should be available in a week or so to date . it will take a good three years to do this . you can see how sad that would be . i like the characters better when the movie is not as exciting as this . also , i had to edit the scene ( s ) several times with my own personal assistant while i sat in front of this tv screen trying to catch up with the others .|0
just what the world needed - another superficial cookie - cutter mary - kate and ashley olsen movie . this movie gives out horrible messages to people who try to live up to its portrayals ; it is completely lacking in substance . we have seen so many movies that you never know what is going to come next because they are so predictable , predictable , predictable . one day , a friend tells us that he has been to see the movies on the internet and it was like the most boring , boring thing ever . but after watching it , i had to agree with them .|0
I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. *spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they aren't scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all.|1
this is strictly for pryor fans . just because he was a great , funny guy does n ' t mean this is the sort of book that will make his career . i had never seen a more depressing movie in my life . as we went through the film , most people could see that there was absolutely no emotion behind the scenes , not even anything that might be worth seeing . i did get some bad readings , but overall it was pretty much what i had expected from someone who had been to movies at least two or three times since i got to this school .|0
this is , for different reasons , a very very bad action movie . first of all , seagal is a great director and we have no chance of him ever winning a film . his movies are really terrible and you do not even need to know the name of the cast to see what is going on . i spent most of the afternoon sitting at the desk next to her while she worked on her laptop in the study . as much as i wanted to spend my evening watching it , i decided i was tired of watching it .|0
bronson took the money and ran with this film ; he must have house payments like me ! this low rent movie is a good one . as a result i can write a lot of things that i really do n't care about . i know some of these movies will be fine , but they all suck . i see a lot of people who were happy to make a movie just to watch it while they are in the public eye . if you think i did this because of my love of comedy , you are mistaken . let me try to explain to you something .|0
do n ' t be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one . it is , but there are only two elements : the obvious and the other actors . 1 . the plot is not even close to the way it was before the movie took off . 2 . it does n't sound right , and 3 . what the hell is happening to me ? i could have done without all these stupid characters . i mean , really . who has to work as a director to be able to make movies that are so far down the road ?|0
roy thinnes and joan hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama . the lush settings , the haunting music , the overall character , the story , the characters , the content - all of it is stunning . how can anyone believe such a thing ? you ca n't . and even if you could , why not see the humor ? no one has ever done something like this to me . i have never been good at laughing with a laugh , especially when someone is watching my reaction . that was the point though . this comedy just does not feel like a comedy .|0
This film's a big bore. It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. It starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.Surya & Jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? He disappears totally after a good half an hour!. Santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.AR's tunes sure will last for sometime. But he could have done better. What ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.|1
this movie , with all its complexity and subtlety , makes for one of the most thought - provoking short films i have ever seen . at first , it was a total waste of time , and as i watch the film i begin to doubt if it was such a terrible idea . when i saw this movie i knew it would be a good fit . after all , the only thing that got me through was the fact i had to look forward to seeing that movie . not knowing about any of the things that happen between actors and writers is something that is very important to me .|0
river ' s edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer neal jimenez . it is based on an old story of a dead girl being murdered by her boss . i am interested in what this character has to say for himself , but not enough to make me feel like i have to watch this one . i can see why they wanted this film . the first thing you will learn about this genre is that it is almost always too boring . the plot is always too interesting to be made fun of . every time you turn around , you find yourself wanting to kill yourself with boredom .|0
the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful . this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life . when i watched it and read the credits , i thought it was a great example of bad films . then , when i went to see this film and saw some of the people that made up this movie , i found myself having second thoughts . i know that this movie could be quite good with its acting and acting , but it was such a letdown that i was going to sit back and let them make it sound better than it actually is .|0
"i have watched two episodes so far , i really like it . even though i am no longer in a position to make much of a play , i feel that maybe this is the beginning of an episode . for me , this time it is one of the best . i would never have come if it were not for what my friends and i did together on many occasions over the last several weeks . this movie was very good , but the plot was bad as well . at some point in the film i decided to buy a copy of "" the dark lagoon "" and check out the opening scene ."|0
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning.|1
it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful.|1
"sweet young nurse charlotte beale ( a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout rosie holotik ) goes to work at the hospital and i think she ' s in shock . why do i say this again ? because , it ' s true . she ' s had three children but each of them has already been given up for adoption due to their father ' s death . oh my god what if she is one of those women who can ' t be turned off by her body ? how could i have been so stupid ? that is why i said "" no "" ."|0
"the brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family : the twenty years old emily brighton ( her mother ) is shot by two people . this film was edited at the last minute , and i am not familiar with what it is doing to the rest of america . i do remember how badly it used to look in the 1960s , but now it seems to be making some sort of spectacle of itself all over the place . i never really liked the film , although i did love the "" good "" parts ."|0
"I'm not here to tell you ""Armored"" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel (""Charlie Varrick"") and Walter Hill (""The Warriors""). Those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. No skirts need apply. They unapologetically made guy movies. Guns, lots of guns. Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. Their movies were like a sap to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. ""Armored"" is so a guy movie."|1
"This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. Wanna know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead ""actress"" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted."|1
this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen . it looked so amateurish . chris hegedus was just getting his feet under him with one of the most famous actors in all of history , and then suddenly he finds himself in a strange land that has never been seen before . after having had to watch some horror movies on tv at school , i am really starting to get used to the idea of aliens landing on earth and shooting people . i think it will be like a movie where you see a ufo take off and everything goes into reverse .|0
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to.|1
"this movie , which i just discovered at the video store , has apparently sit around for a couple of hours . "" "" what else ? "" asked bates . 
 "" well , some of the characters seem to feel that they know each other from somewhere in the distant past and have been friends for years . these guys are definitely not the type of heroes who would want to make a movie out of the same film as one of them . it was all too fast . there is so much going on , but the last scene was so bad that i can not even start to figure it out ."|0
hilary was great as julie , and pat was once again magnificent as mr . miyagi , but there should have been no mistaking the similarities between the two of them . they were both good - looking , with thick dark hair and long features . they were very tall , with broad shoulders and a well - defined jaw . they had some serious looks , and it appeared to me that they were not all too bad at it . they also had strong builds and an easy manner about them , even if it was only in english .|0
the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised : good campy fun with lots of happy endings that will last a very long time . there were a lot of laughs , so i could n't be bothered getting out of bed to enjoy it any longer . no big deal . i have a really bad feeling that this movie is one of the best in my life . if i would like to see this show again , i can assure you that it wo n't be nearly as entertaining as this one but i must admit that i got a thrill from watching it myself .|0
boring movie . poor plot . poor actors . the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco somewhere , and i see a little more of it . this film is not actually an actual production of the movie . it just appears in the ' twilight zone ' genre which is what most people expect when they wake up in the middle of the night with no idea how much time has passed . you would think that there would have been something about this film that would really bother you . however , you do n't find anything like this on the internet .|0
I love Japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to Westerners. They might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others view things Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton!|1
One of my desires is to be a film-maker, and I just have to say there's no way I will be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watching it, I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed.Estevez's and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing.And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2.|1
is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch ? just like i was saying , she could have been on stage in a movie about witches and werewolves . even as i thought it , i realized that there were two reasons for this book - first of all : 1 ) the premise was very strange ; second , no one knew much about the witch . i can only guess at its origin and based upon the characters , their personalities , etc . ( i ' m sure that these books are full of crap ) .|0
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just don't fly, do it? Why then has it received so much praise?|1
"this movie was bad on so many levels . the writing was horrible so even the best actors could not make it . the title of the book is a good one , though the plot is uninteresting . i saw this movie in a film called "" what to expect "" that i loved . it started off well enough , with a funny story that made you laugh out loud and made you think . the ending was awful , too , but by the time you watched it , you were actually feeling sorry for somebody who had been cheated out of a fortune by a cheating spouse ."|0
"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II."|1
"franco films can be divided into 4 categories - the ` ` earlies ' ' ( often black and white and inventive ) , the "" raisins "" ( "" cockerel "" ) . in some of these movies , when the characters get too creative they have to change roles . as a result of this , it is really quite funny to see so many other actors acting like idiots on film . i do not mean to say that there is nothing funny about this movie . there is no point in telling you what is funny if you are just a stupid kid trying to entertain yourself ."|0
A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European's idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament.|1
` the last frontier ' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers jed scott , an ex - military major who runs a ranch in mexico and spends most of his life on horseback . it has two notable flaws : ( 1 ) you do not want to kill someone unless they actually die . 2 ) you hate them when they die , even if it is only for some reason you feel guilty over it . and 3 ) you are afraid to see the real jed scott in the flesh at all . he is just too hot and too scary for me .|0
This is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic, big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.I couldn't believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed.|1
this is film is probably one of the best i ' ve seen so far . i would put it only half - decent at least . there ' s too much in here that doesn ' t sound right . there are pictures of old people who look like they should be on a comedy team , and others who look like those who have lost their hair . you want to take this movie seriously ? okay , sure , do it for the fun of it , but let ' s just make sure it ' s real .|0
First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing.Second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? They were killed *before* the surgery took place! Third - how the heck did Lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use?|1
"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it."|1
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense.|1
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't.|1
I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech.|1
"Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the ""film noir"" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) ""dupey"" looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it."|1
I can't express enough just how bad this film was. First of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well I guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. The script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. I imagine maybe if I saw this back when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst.|1
'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and per agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low renting rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in, and weird stuff starts happening, and because this is a B-grade horror flick, there's a dumb, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why.|1
"I am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of crap. I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it. I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.There was no credit for who did the voice of ""The Dark One"". Sounded a bit like Patrick Stewart at times.A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that."|1
James Stewart plays Johnny Mason, lawyer. Carole Lombard is Jane Mason, wife. Lucile Watson the mother-in-law Harriet Mason. Johnny sees Jane and quickly marries her. Mother is disappointed. Mother lives with them. Many troubles are ahead. Jane can't cook. Can't set the table. Can't do many things according to mother. The interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. Stewart and Lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. Stewart is Stewart. He is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film.|1
"ok . a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . be careful about who you see at the store , and do not let anyone get you into trouble . "" he said seriously . i laughed as i pulled on my sweatshirt . "" yeah i know what you mean . i would like to come too . we could meet up more often . "" i wanted to say some things but did not want to seem clingy or needy . instead i asked , "" so where are you taking me ? "" "" well it has been awhile since i have really seen one of my kids ."|0
"If you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy ""special"" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! Not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. The special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie."|1
do n ' t look in the basement this little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the inside of my own skull . all i can say to myself is : why ca nt i have just left her alone ? i thought we were friends . how could things have gone so wrong ? when did i become one of the bad guys again ? i am very sorry for everything i have put you through , but what else can i do ? it took me years to get to where i am today .|0
this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i ' ve ever experienced with a film . the acting is not bad but the scenes are so wrong that they make me laugh . i don ' t think it was too hard to get the film started , and as a result we got an amazing amount of work done on this one . i can ' t wait to see the look on my boss ' s face when i tell him what just happened . he looks like he wants to beat the world into submission ; i will definitely be the one to put his face to shame after this movie .|0
hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night? Can't find what your looking for? I thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie.|1
im warning you people out there , this is just a waste of your time . i am being honest with you here , i really am . i know how important this game is for the entire world and i like to see my viewers happy . i believe that many of you will be able to enjoy the show as it plays on tv or on youtube . i can only imagine how difficult this is for you guys to watch . you must remember that these videos are in no way funny . what we are getting into here is absolutely ridiculous and completely lacking in originality .|0
grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film . its hit man theme is very dry and is so trite it makes me wish i had an actual one . the only way to make it look like it actually happens , is if you ' re willing to believe that there are such people as this movie , or even see it . however , in fact , it appears that they don ' t have the balls to try hard at it . i saw the movie on tv a couple days after i got out of the academy .|0
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care?|1
Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood, and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 R D Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyricsEven if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.)|1

i loved this movie when it first came out ( but i was just 12 years old then - and i was very much a big fan of this movie , especially since i was only 17 ) . i do n't care if the plot is bad . this film is great because i loved it so much it took me months to figure out what that meant . but now i have to pay for it , and i 'm really looking forward to this movie . i love being in the game with tom cruise , even though he is not very funny .|0
this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in . the movie had no real characters , and i was a little disappointed when the director did n't give us a lot of dialogue . he gave us the chance to really talk about some of the characters , but they were all so lame that we were too scared to even consider acting our part . it has to be an awful waste of time because most of the people in this film are completely unoriginal , which makes it hard for us to make a good impression on anyone .|0
Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie.|1
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen.|1
ridiculous , nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ; ineptly , superficially , and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches . i have n't read any of these movies , and it made me want to gag . but that 's exactly where i would be going next if i was watching this . i will never understand actors . i do not follow how they work , how they relate to a character , or even what he or she actually looks like . in fact , i always find myself trying to make fun of the people who do this crap .|0
"(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with ""Night of the Demons,"" but, you know, they're basically the same thing."|1
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous.|1
this movie sucks so bad . its funny to see what a poor story this has , where two pea - brained characters do something stupid , then fall for the wrong people . but i never thought that it was so sad that everyone on the planet is having to deal with such a horrible life . even when you are going to be in love with someone after three months of dating , there is really no point in getting all romantic and emotional about it . well , that 's okay , though . it did not make me feel very much like falling in love , either .|0
ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career . . . . as i had to see this one , it was the best movie of my life and i felt like i did n't know where to look . there are some great movies but we should be thinking of a lot more . the most interesting thing about this movie is that i knew exactly where to look for you , so why did i not ? i have tried to find you a few times and even when i thought you were going to get your way , you always turned up .|0
as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism . after all , fun has its moments and many of those were pretty bad . you have to admit that they were pretty terrible . this was the first movie i had ever watched at least 2 , 000 times . there are plenty of horror movies that make your heart skip a beat or two , but none of them have anything to do with me . what am i thinking ? it just is not fair to let my parents see this kind of shit on tv .|0
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the Caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . Also, it would have been very simple to make. All the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel.|1
this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall . it is hard to compare such badness to what you see on bad movies , but i found it fascinating that the characters were able to come and go so easily . i do not have any trouble talking about it . there are lots of people in this movie who have already seen it ; i can talk about it at a reasonable speed . the first few scenes are very similar , but they are not as entertaining as the rest of the film itself . i am pretty sure that most of the characters are completely unoriginal , except one or two .|0
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler), loopy Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee), and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams).|1
the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter . i just wanted a better idea about how to best get this thing moving . one of my first ideas is to give them a different movie when they are not watching it or even thinking about seeing it in action . i am pretty sure we can make some great movies though . i mean , look at all of the characters , and i had no idea that these were real people living here . after looking around for a while i decided to take a little more time to watch them .|0
"i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet - paper . no respect whatsoever to many of its characters or a single title , which i know is a load of horseshit , but what else can you expect when you hear that people are in their fifties ' s "" eighties "" and living in the sixties ? well , these days there is no more than 60 years left before the movies are done , and at the time of filming the original script has not been seen since 1998 . it 's hard to believe that such an old testament film could have been made in 1912 ."|0
in a morocco completely invaded by europeans and americans , in the beginning of the twentieth century , the moroccan revolution was very good . but once it became apparent that there would be no more american movies or movie shows ( especially the last three weeks ) , this film came to a dead end . all you could do was go with one script , which was pretty boring . every time i looked at the tv , i thought ' this is really going to suck ' so i tried to get back to the real life .|0
eleven years ago , stanley ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of edge city by finding a way to ' get rid of ' this bad boy , but he ended up getting killed in vietnam . i could never understand how people could agree on anything when they had just seen the movie it was not something you saw on tv . at that point i found myself wanting to ask about the story , but i did n't know how much i wanted to hear about it . so i just let it pass .|0
"Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. When he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that ""other folks garbage"" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill."|1
"Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. Absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help cringe when I recall some of his lines, like ""In or out? You're worse than a cat!"""|1
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. On the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.I'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi.I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised.|1
the most obvious flaw . . . horrible , horrible script . this movie had a potentially good story , but it did not have the potential for success . it could have been a lot worse . in any event , i decided to keep writing . i really do n't care if my parents like me or not , and i know they will get annoyed if i write too much , so here i am , writing at night . it 's difficult to find anything more interesting to do with myself . i usually watch the tv when i read about movies , but today it seems as if no one actually watches them .|0
"It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that ""Aeon Flux"" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around."|1
beautiful . . . . that one word pretty much sums up this whole film . everything from the cinematography , the directing , the casting and even the dialogue . it is absolutely fantastic . if you really do n't like it , just drop it . i 'm a writer , not an actor and as far as i can tell , most of the people on this movie are only interested in what they 're supposed to be focusing on . i found this movie to be somewhat pathetic . the acting is very bad and the dialogue is completely lacking in detail .|0
Mute Witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there, a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film.|1
i do n ' t understand why some of you ( or many ) have given this film upward of 8 stars in my life . they also gave this movie upwards of 7 stars per year at the age of 15 . i think it 's an excellent script with a great plot , but the plot is not quite as interesting as the story . i can see why there are a lot of people who would like to give this film a happy ending , but it does not feel like the kind of thing you really expect .|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and besides Jean Peters in the starring role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes.|1
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that's not saying too much.|1
"Korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's ""Mister Lonely"" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion."|1
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm, son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up.|1
"when i first saw this show i thought to my self ` ` what is this ! ! ! ! ! ? ! ' i did n't think this was very funny at all . 
 "" it turns out that this is one of those movies that you are not looking for because you were in the same place a long time ago . the main thing is that there is no good way to tell if this is a film or a comedy . the acting seems to be poor , and the dialogue lacks depth and structure ."|0
"i heard legends about this ` ` film ' ' ( quotes used so as not to insult films ) for a price of $ 49.95 . i was shocked when i found it in a trash bin in the mall . i also did not buy it . what a waste of time ! and i should have paid attention to the reviews , because there is a good deal more about this "" movie . "" i really wanted to get a look at it . i mean , it had been written by some guy who actually lives in seattle , but no one knows who he is ."|0
a bad quentin tarantino rip off , at least i hope that ' s what they were going for because at the moment i am not interested in seeing much of anything . unfortunately , when the credits roll it appears that some movie was filmed in the early 80 ' 80s which was good and bad but really just did n't interest me enough to look any further than the scene with the zombie apocalypse . so i went into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich and tried to forget about it as i ate my sandwiches .|0
this is one of the best action films i have seen . geena ' s portrayal of the tough as nails movie in which the characters are told to stand by and not make a single move . i like it . the whole scene is pretty lame . you can see that from here . i don ' t even think that geena was aware of the bad stuff that goes on behind her back . it ' s very clear to see that she ' s been doing her job just fine until we walk out into this studio .|0
"a chicago couple , dillon and dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . people begin to wonder if the police will show up to get the kids back . that is all i could tell you at the time . but now , this has become something else : there have been other reports of shooting and shootings from local authorities . one of them involved a man in a large car . as it happens , the man was killed before his death . what would you like to do with this piece of news ? ' "" 
 the camera cut to the studio again ."|0
i watched this film last night , i though i would rent a horror / scary film from blockbusters and i got this dvd because of that . it was an old friend of mine from high school who had been in the army . i used to be one of his buddies but we never talked much about being friends . i do n't really talk about my personal life or the events that have led me here . all i remember is what i saw in it and i just want to keep it that way . if i see a movie like this again i might just take it out and put it away .|0
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days, Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy acting of lead Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it.|1
this movie was a disappointment . the story is essentially the shining with a castle ( or a very cheap hotel ) , but it failed miserably in that the plot was much better than what i was expecting . to be able to pick one of my favourites is not something that i have ever really wanted to try . when i first got the idea , i found that the book was about how people ' ll ' m supposed to treat their spouse and family if they don ' t ' ve seen it yet . i had just read a book by someone else who ' d been married for a long time .|0
this movie makes ` ` glitter ' ' look like ` ` schindler ' s list . ' ' tarantino and the weinsteins really need to get a life ' . i can tell that it was made from the same stuff . the story , of course , did n't make much sense to me , other than the part where the people on film have no problems being alive . there was a man in 1940 who was a friend of mine who got into some pretty terrible trouble with someone . he was killed in a car accident at an abandoned factory , so he ended up in a morgue .|0
estevez , martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war . but if you get all the way to the end of this film then you find that it has no redeeming qualities . what should be one of the worst parts is when they begin with the sad story about a man living in an abandoned hut surrounded by people who call themselves his own . at this time in the story , don ' t pay any special attention to how bad things were for him during his career . he was treated unfairly and made to feel inferior .|0
"this film works on a lot of different levels . it ' s a profile of one very cool couple , a man and a woman . the woman is in her early thirties . she is very pretty , with deep chestnut brown hair that falls straight down to her waist and eyes that are slightly too bright . the man has a beautiful blonde bob and his smile is perfect . as for the brunette - "" what was her name again ? - i didn ' t get a chance to look at her picture . all i could do was guess who she might be ."|0
i will never , ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 . even at the young age of 18 , i watched it for only a couple of minutes and left . i did not get to sit on the couch again for 3 more days . it was my job to make sure that everything went perfectly . there was one part of this program that caught my eye in particular : ' what is an evil god ? ' this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . let me try to say that some of the worst reviews from the film have been good .|0
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame American monster flick needs affordable SFX.|1
A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died.|1
"` ` cat in the brain ' ' is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels like it has to be real , "" i said . this was a story designed for a child who would grow up to be a big star athlete . there were dozens of characters and events that i had never seen before , yet these characters had an uncanny quality about them , which made me wonder if someone had played with their mind . at first i thought it was funny but as we got closer , i began to notice what they were talking about ."|0
"this is an excellent documentary about a story i had n ' t heard about before . the first solo , non - stop film that i saw was very good ; the dialogue was pretty good . however , the premise seemed to be quite strange : 
 there is this one girl who got into a car accident and was attacked by her father . when she sees the man , she becomes enraged and tries to kill him with a gun . the man runs off and does not come home . the police find out later that this was planned by a young man who happens to be living in san jose ."|0
this movie was so awful that i ca n ' t even describe it . i was amazed that i even sat there to watch it . but , then , i really wasn ' t any more surprised than i already was . what did he expect me to see ? i had seen all of my favorite movies before ; and i never thought that i would see anything like this from this point forward . as i watched the first one , it occurred to me that this film was not nearly as bad as the other ones . when i turned the tv on , i realized that it was actually pretty good .|0
i know it ' s rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but i am just curious if you had your own idea how this should have been made . let ' s start by saying that this film is not even remotely interesting . why ? well , i guess it is because it was all done so early in the summer and we didn ' t get much time to watch it . i do not like horror movies either but these are really nice ones , especially the gory parts .|0
"Pete's Meteor. I seen this referred to as ""authentic"" and a ""gem."" I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kinda wished that I didn't.Apparently this was noted as being Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother."|1
first i must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book . so of course , i have some regrets . i wanted to give it more credit , but i did not see how the plot could have been more interesting . i was not prepared to write about the big bang theory because it sounds so boring , but in this case , it had something to do with the creation of the nuclear explosion that killed at least 100 % of the world population in the last 20 years and set them back over 90 years or so .|0
"So bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers ""horror"" flicks? The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called ""uniforms"" the ""military"" jokers wear. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in ""Jurassic Park,"" but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here."|1
"The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys any and all things, the Bible claims to be true. To people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called ""blasphemy"", and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear, that many people think of it as a good sequel to the Bible. However, the film shows you a lot of things and subjects, that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the ""Revelation""."|1
"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, ""Rainbow Connection,"" Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a ""rich and famous contract"" to entertain."|1
"It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Maybe the one true genius artist of British Film to emerge out of the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer-aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems and governmental solutions. Thus, his work is probably less ""filmic"" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality."|1
I watched this film last night, i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out. The opening scenes were so long winded, the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere. The story line seemed so poor to me, she gave him HIV and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected ( i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people) Then when he dumps the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet, was in the forest and saw him dumping the body.|1
it ' s a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams , and when the movie is done you know that it really is not so bad . in a way it is rather good . i don ' t believe in this movie itself at all but if you ask me , this movie is much more than just funny . it ' s scary , it has a lot of creepy characters and even plays a different character . i would say that it is one of the worst reviews i have ever seen and i will never admit that to anyone again .|0
asmali konak has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey . with its unique premise , we may never have a moment 's fame if it were not for two very obvious differences in the plot : the movie was so lame that i felt like someone had left me on the bus and then switched off the lights when i looked up from my magazine . as much as i enjoyed the acting , this movie could not have produced an even better ending . however , there is one other factor that strikes me as odd .|0
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. Alas, with TV movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap Cosmo questionnaire films. With a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better.|1
This movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store. It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. The actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. The only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. The remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog.|1
**Might contain spoilers**Ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think that? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved.|1
so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie . i came across this and rented it from an old couple that lived next to each other . when i walked through the door they both looked at me , but then they said that you had no business taking pictures with your kids . i got very frustrated and decided not to buy anything of mine . i watched this movie because there was nothing else to do - just watch it and try to think about something besides my pain and misery . after awhile , though , i started to realize how much i really enjoyed it .|0
i was rather disappointed . the first tetsuo made me an instant tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins ' to the 10 . he seemed to have a lot more time and talent than me . i thought he could learn something important in this life , like how to give up smoking . maybe if he spent as much time studying as i did , he might be prepared for the next chapter of his life . what a waste of time ! one thing i noticed about this movie was that it has a great dialogue . we really liked this movie because it had a character so young .|0
Although I saw this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. From what I can make of it, this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers.|1
my first post at the imdb has to ( unfortunately ) be to warn others not to waste their time . it is difficult to tell who actually reads these books when you read them - or even if they wrote them in english . and as a reader i am not surprised about the movie that takes place during this movie . there are a few good parts , some bad , some very good parts . however , once you get started with the main story , you never really know which one of those are real or what part they are playing .|0
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' London.The movie is held completely in 'dark' colours, which I personally don't like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.|1
"Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic ""Godfather"" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded."|1
"this movie was absolutely terrible . the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from the director was "" what a joke "" . the acting and quality are great , but there is no reason why the director had to put this film into production . i really want to read that movie one last time before we leave town . if it has any effect at all on my enjoyment of it , i promise you i will never repeat the experience again . thank you for seeing this movie . i truly believe this movie might be a success , and i love the book so much ."|0
Take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. So sorry. I really tried to like it.|1
this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50 ' s , 60 ' s . it came to a bad end when the old guy who ran it all got sick . his family ( and many others ) abandoned him on the coast of canada in 1965 . that movie was never made again . he died in a cabin fire in alaska in 1999 . while the story is not one of my best , even i did not know anything about what went on there or what they were trying to create .|0
the acting is awkward and creepy , and not in a good way . . . at all . the writing , although it appears to be well written , is just about as predictable as an old movie . i like this part because it does n't take very long to get the actors ' expectations and expectations up . even when you are watching them with a viewer , they still seem to be getting what they really want out of the script . this book is one of the reasons i have chosen to read this book .|0
Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.|1
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years. It struck home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson/Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How large the real table was on which Treat danced. How driven the wizard behind the curtain.|1
pretty lousy made - for - tv sequel to the roman polanski classic . rosemary ' s son adrian has grown up and is embodied in that movie . his mother was a woman who lived in an apartment complex when he first moved in with her . after one night out with him , he tried to have sex but it was not successful . on the whole , he looks pretty much the same , although there are some similarities . in the movie this guy goes into the woods and finds another guy . the poor guy loses his life and gets abducted and killed by two people in the woods .|0
a while back i bought the chinese box set of fist of the north star which came with all of my stuff , there was this one movie where i got caught up in a fight and killed someone . you would n't believe how many people died ! no , it really was not as scary as some of the movies were portraying , it was pretty awesome . i am so sorry for being so stupid , i just loved the movie , and i thought it would be an inspiration to make me a new friend , so i made a special dvd that would take me away from home .|0
i must admit that i did n ' t get around to seeing this movie in the theater . as it was about a girl who gets into an accident , she just could have done better . i tried not to like the first part and had to give up after two minutes of watching it . well , i started to see some of the others but mostly kept to myself . what 's the deal with these people ? what would make them do such a terrible thing ? you would think they would at least want someone to take the blame for their crime .|0
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home.|1
first of all , i personally adore demons and demons 2 , i saw them although it was hard to watch . this movie had some pretty heavy stuff on the side . the actors were quite good , most of the acting was horrible , the scenes were atrocious , and everyone was just stupid . i found myself really looking forward to this movie with a slight twinge in my chest at the thought of what would have happened if i had not agreed to be in it . however , since i am the one that starred in this particular film , i am not going to complain about the bad parts .|0
"I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. I think it's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movie ""City of God"", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. I enjoyed very much the soundtrack."|1
` ` what alice found ' ' is the greatest movie that nobody ' s ever heard of ! i underestimated it when i told my wife about this movie . i wanted to show her all the pictures and videos , but she was too tired and stressed out to listen . she said she ' d see them on friday morning . i did believe her , but i have to admit i had hoped it would be something different , but after a little more time i was disappointed . at least then i didn ' t have to look into the eyes of anyone who would make an enemy .|0
"I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got. The acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the ""sand map"". It was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic."|1
!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees .So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ?|1
This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. 'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland.|1
one of the best of the ' kitchen - sinks ' . fantastic views of london and invaluable snippets of working class life . not only do they look beautiful in their clothes , but they make the whole thing seem like an episode on tv . i wish it were that bad . i 'd love to have seen it with my own eyes and would love to be at home in my room . no , i would rather die . if you see something like this movie , you can imagine how hard it was to keep it going ( or even get away with it ) .|0
i watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively . anger surged in me to see the ruin of hanoi . it made me feel sick . i could not sleep for the next few hours . this is just a stupid movie , right ? why are all these terrible movies so boring ? they get more and more boring as the weeks go by . what was the point of being an idiot when life did not seem any less boring than it already was ? one minute you are watching a film and on the next minute you are watching a movie . how can people do that ?|0
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of a sorority I didn't want them to make Greek organizations look bad....but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.All the characters are pretty likable minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha His character brings so much to the show.|1
"Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre-""Malcolm in the Middle"" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. It has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed."|1
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together.|1
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching. Then I didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry.|1
2005 was one of the best year for movies . we had so many wonderful movies , like batman begins at the top and ends with a villain ; this movie was very boring . it did have a little bit of fun though , which is why all of us felt more comfortable with it . i really wanted to see this movie before i lost my nerve . but alas , i could never get past the initial feeling of being watched ( by someone else ) . in some way , this movie makes me feel like i have to go on camera to do it .|0
"The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. She telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an ""actress"" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as Dad is 'trying to impress his boss'."|1
in extramarital we see b - actress traci lords at her very best . she ' s all wrapped in horror & suspense that the characters have somehow made up a story for themselves and are trying to help someone else write one . i could ' t disagree with that , so i decided to watch it for a couple of minutes . as usual , it ' s not good . the acting is horrible and the scene looks awful . this movie didn ' t seem to be able to portray the plot . what makes it even worse was the fact that no one ever seems to know who the heroine is .|0
"I caught this on HBO under its category of ""Guilty Pleasures"", and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. One, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn ""who did it"", you think, ""So what?"". However, I must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson get completely naked a number of times."|1
a film , first and foremost , should be good storytelling . it should be entertaining - and entertaining does sound like a great idea . i would also recommend it to other kids who like to watch films made from the movies of the past and see what they think they saw . but you have to listen to this film before you can really enjoy it : it is one of the most boring , ugly and annoying movie i have ever seen ( although it seems to make me feel that way even watching it makes me sick ! ) so let me tell you something about this film in general .|0
"ocean ' s twelve is probably better than ocean ' s eleven . i know most people would disagree , but i really do not give a crap what some of the other kids think . this movie was really good and it seems to be on dvd . i want to go see something like this again someday . i can not believe we just watched an old movie that did not make it to its title , let alone how they came upon it . 
 "" well , i 'm pretty sure you should have watched this once before . "" i commented as we walked out onto the dock ."|0
I'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but I'm sorry, this film is awful. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least that many clichés. It's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. And his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style.|1
` ` the journey ' ' is a romantic version of the cold war . it ' s about an english woman ( who does not speak british ) who wants to kill a man . you can tell by the way she was acting when she wrote the movie , and i know that 's what she would have done . but there ' s another story , one that doesn ' t really get any interesting . this film has nothing to do with my father ' s involvement in the civil war and is just as depressing as the movies themselves .|0
"If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc. ), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of ""The Christmas Story"" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way."|1
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.The music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson's.I can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.|1
Dear reader, Watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. If you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. However, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an American audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons.|1
given the acting roles he played in the 1940s ( casper gutman , signior ferrari , mr . peters , jerome jones ) : we must be moving too fast ; we have no idea what 's happening . it may be an accident , or it may be a real thing . i know this movie has a lot to do with some of the plot that is being used , but if you like this movie and want to read the story , just say so . if you hate the movie , please tell the author to send me a letter about it now .|0
It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover.|1
never mind the serious logic gaps , never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals , never mind the haphazard writing of characters in a film . i think we are all beginning to see through to the very core of these characters . you will find that this novel is actually quite decent . it has been a little too long since i wrote one and i was trying to get back to enjoying it . my main problem is with the actors , because i seem to be the only one stuck with them . the rest of the time they seem to have no idea what they are up against .|0
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt like it was about one hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie.|1
` ` female convict scorpion - beast stable ' ' , the third in the series , is a magnificent piece of art . this film can be pretty funny , and i like that it has an engaging atmosphere that makes you feel like you 're on a roller coaster ride rather than on a jet plane . but the story behind this movie is really just an attempt to avoid getting into trouble . when i saw the movie last season , i got scared . i mean , who would give up something as valuable as a tv show ?|0
i have recently found this film on one of my husband ' s vhs tapes ( the blank variety which he likes to use for movies ) , and it has made me very angry with the world . what i saw at the end was an awful portrayal of the bad guy . when i see this movie ; i immediately start feeling sorry for the actors . there is nothing else i can do to help my husband , and that makes me feel terrible for him . if i were a movie star , i 'd be acting better , but i hate being judged for my career .|0
"This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible "" Sarah`s law "" following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud ."|1
obviously , someone was looking at catching onto the ` ` blair witch ' ' wave . this movie was set up like all of the others and i liked it a little less than what i would have expected to see in one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life . if you do not watch these episodes , you are apt to find yourself sitting through the entire series in the middle of the night with a very hard - on for this particular movie that is more of a horror flick than any kind of tv show .|0
It's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches Froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.When it started I already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players.|1
"certainly this film is not for everybody - - - but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period . that movie ' s not for everyone . it ' s bad enough when you ' ve got a bunch of other people who think they know the story but they ' re just looking to see what kind of guy "" s doing it . "" i ' ve never heard any of your stories before . i didn ' t even know you were in films until this morning . well , as a matter of fact i was surprised ."|0
"I was so ""impressed"" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try. It is the near future, post apocalypse of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. Oh my! Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is hardly up (or down) to HUNT's level."|1
This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, naturally, is larger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and Courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. The period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial.|1
"this really is an ""okay"" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving it all..so here's the recipe to get a great show."|1
"if you have n ' t read tolkien ' s masterpiece ; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever ! if you find your way to the following series in this book , enjoy a few of the best scenes : 
 the first one is an awesome thriller . i think i will take a short peek at it from time to time to make sure it ' s really a good story . it ' s hard not to watch it once or twice every week though . after seeing what it looks like in movies , i had to agree that it ' s too good to be true ."|0
When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget.|1
i wo n ' t be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season , but then , things changed . unfortunately for me , the show was not a success at all . when i left the theatre , i thought that i might be able to see it through . if you get this part , you can see what real actors are doing as well . this is actually a wonderful time to learn and to do something useful . i have made two great movies , one with some good ideas in it , and the other with an even better set .|0
shtrafbat is the story only russians could tell about the second world war . the largest front of the whole thing was a nuclear missile launch from new york to washington , dc in 1973 . this movie is very poorly executed . it is so much more complicated than anything we have ever watched and i find myself laughing out loud at its complete lack of originality . how come there are no words ? i do not think it is possible to express this many characters in a movie based on two different parts of the same story . the main purpose of the movie is that it portrays people with similar personalities .|0
This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem.|1
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12."|1

"I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the ""world premiere"" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say, I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I am unfamiliar with the book, purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, as I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by Jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me."|1
This movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. All the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes I ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. At least I was entertained. The ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I didn't care to remember. And what was with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. And where the heck did that guy (John Corbett's character) come from?|1
"get the cd instead . the show is tame , and the editing sucks . the crowd gets way too much enjoyment out of it . "" "" so what 's the best part ? "" i asked .

the finest short i ' ve ever seen . some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened , due to the fact that one of the most successful stories in the series has been thrown back in its face by an overweight , middle aged gentleman who does not believe in what he is doing or where he thinks he is going . the movie was a terrible waste of my money and i hate films . when i saw this one , i was not expecting it to be funny , nor was i expecting to see it for a living .|0
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. Mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.SPOILER--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated.Plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee, and others. The apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style.|1
i would give this a zero if they had that rating . fun was no fun at all . i mean , why would you want to go to the beach with an ice cream cone ? i mean , how hard could it be ? ! anyway , i have heard of people who do this in the movies . but , i have never seen any real films like this before . my parents loved their movies , but they did n't have any idea what they were going to see . so , here i am , on the other hand , trying to make something for them .|0
I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born.|1
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher Graduation Day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.What it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!|1
it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw , however . if you want to understand something ( and it is definitely not hard to do when you have to deal with such people ) , it 's that most of the scenes are completely incomprehensible . as an example , i think some of the actors actually believe that they were part of some kind of ancient cult . all the characters are very similar but a lot of the dialogue has been turned off at times . this is really difficult for me to follow .|0
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of, including several on the stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen! He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. The way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (as Hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life.|1
there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda , that story told about young writer who is in a canoe paddling through the river with his family . the story itself is good , but it reminds me so much of someone else i have never met or been involved with . all of the plot was great and the dialogue well written . however , as i read this movie , my mind wanders to other things . oh , what i would like to write if i could get something out of it . . . i do n't know why i ever had to go to see this film .|0
"The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, ""Lulu"" (Melanie Griffith) had been observing him from the other side of the deli. ""Lulu"" is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page-boy cut."|1
spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . the jokes are n ' t funny in a way most of the movies are . i mean , if you were watching this movie on tv it would be like having a dog who had died from cancer . there have been some good comedies about dogs ; there have been some pretty good ones about puppies that got killed or lost their owners . but none of them ever make me sit through the movie . it is so boring and boring . i really feel sorry for these people who have to watch such a stupid movie .|0

There's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by Bruce Ramsay) are terrorised by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick.|1

"THE worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen allot. Acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! Ok, I admit, `Air Bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `Soccer Dog'. This ""dog"" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, don't watch this movie."|1

Amazing. I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. I know America was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war."|1
the title , although singular , will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of tod browning ' s immortal classic about a zombie infestation . i just do not know if this movie is a good fit for the movies , but we need to find out . after having seen almost all of the dvd trailers , and finding that it was not recommended in the series , i wanted to see what type of film they actually watched . i am not saying that even though i like this film , it really does not give me much of a clue as to why any of the titles are so popular .|0
I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress.|1
oh , yawn . not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even worse if they take their bra off . it would be a total waste of time anyway because there is no way to watch a movie without seeing what the guys look like in the real world . so why should we watch a movie when we could watch a movie on my cell ? i have always found that watching a movie with the intention of making them feel better about themselves would be more fun than watching a movie that was n't worth watching .|0
the evil that men do ( 1984 ) was one of the few non - cannon films charlie bronson made during the 1960s . he has a great work to say about this movie . i found it hard to believe that rick ' s brother , jack , actually got killed in that movie . what sort of film would lead to something like this ? if you ask me , there are far worse actors on earth . why would anyone want to become a villain anyway ? but then again , how did they get out of bed in the first place ? no one knows .|0

"Waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.And after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's ""rubbish bin for totally useless things"". One single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.CB is etremely campy, and intentionally so.

whoa , this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen ! the packaging for the film is really cheap and very old - fashioned . the dialogue is a bit off but they are good . the main characters are great ; it is so easy to get confused about what they are saying ( as well as the inflections ) . the most terrible parts are the language : some of the actors are funny , some of them are not , and it is all quite boring . here is your chance at a real action movie .|0
I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really weren't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality.|1
( possible ? ? spoilers included , but nothing critical given away . ) i just watched this classic low budget version of the novel . as i was watching the movie , my mind wandered and i wondered why i liked it so much . if i do not watch this thing , i will never have a reason to leave home . in all honesty , you can not possibly imagine me living in an environment like this . i spent my childhood there with my friends . after high school i did not go into any of the places i thought were normal until i saw the horror movies .|0
"I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact isn't at all. Not so much profound for a such subject. ""eternity"" never-ending life. Experiences after death and ""dejavu"". The film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. It's so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The Middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best."|1
mild spoilers below . the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when tfw was filmed . from the opening scene , a great man and his team were captured by the local police and dragged into a room . they were locked up for at least 15 minutes - i do not even think it was more than 10 seconds . the bad part is they were still able to make out who was in the room during this short film as they were being interviewed . there are many theories about who would have had access to this videotape , but no one could come up with any evidence of these people being accomplices .|0

This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old Hollywood films. The movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms.|1
pure schlock from beginning to end . the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on a subject , but nothing is all that different as long as you do n't have an audience . what was going on back there at home ? how did we get into this place ? i want to talk to your dad . i 'm really sorry to hear about what happened to you in the hospital , but if you will allow me to give you a second chance , you can come up with some better stuff for this movie .|0
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago . and , i must say , this is the worst comedy i ever read . i was going to let you in on a few things , first of all , since i like to think it may have been written by a very bad person ( which makes sense , considering what they did to him in the end ) . secondly , i am really tired of movies that make people laugh when they are about to die . i guess i need to learn some things about the human condition .|0

the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief , you grant them it in the hope that given a choice - and this is a fair one - they can make an example out of some of the others . if you do nothing , the makers wo n't be able to do anything about it . if you fail , you may well have to pay the price . i just ca n't find it in myself to write a story like that . so no thanks . why not go live in europe ? or somewhere in the middle east ?|0
Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.|1
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! This has got to be one of THE worse movies I've EVER seen! I do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as I watched it!|1
I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrid and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age I did not laugh once at the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the 'R' movie my parents were in.|1
the director godfrey reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen him doing this . i am truly sorry for the way this thing has come off . in fact , i hope that you can make it through this film . you will get to see how terrible my character is . at the same time , i am quite sure that he is just trying to make me laugh so badly that i will probably forget the whole thing . i suppose it could be said that i never saw much humor in this work .|0
a couple of clarifying comments are in order . herschell gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of this movie which i did not see but it seemed rather good . it 's a small one , nothing special and it has lots of twists and turns so i am impressed . on the screen i could make out a picture of me , my parents and a girl i did not know ; her eyes were bright with life and her hair was long and brown . i wonder why they have taken me in ? she was so cute and funny .|0
"based on what little i have seen of this show i do n ' t think i will ever watch it again , if you see it . "" i could n't stop staring at the picture of the two of them , but i really wanted to check it out . there is no way she looks more like a model than she does when she is in the flesh . as we got to the stage , i saw a young woman take the microphone from the audience and say something that i was not sure i should be paying attention to . her voice seemed so familiar ."|0
"It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie's ""real life."""|1
I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves).|1
"I recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about dreadful! Any movie Ed Wood ever put out looks like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as ""These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me"" Classic! The mad 'Jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter."|1
i really enjoyed bg seasons 1 - 3 and really could n ' t understand those who did n ' t like it . but i don ' t care if you like the song because you can have it ! when i first saw that movie , i felt a little bit of sadness at the fact that i didn ' t get to see it again . i was too busy obsessing over what would happen if i actually became an actor . i thought back to the time i spent with mark brosnan , thinking that i would go to live with him and his wife for two years ( which seemed like forever ) .|0
First, and foremost, I take issue to the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they are referring is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but I assure you, it is singular in Spanish.Next, I thought this movie had been done years ago. It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been kind of scary.Let's talk about the special effects.|1
a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 . it was playing in the theater , as you can tell . i did not know what to say or how to proceed . i saw that there was an asian lady at the end and i asked her if i could sit with her so i could talk to her . of course , she wanted me to sit with her , but i decided against it because i was too afraid of making a scene . so i pretended to be on a date with my friend amy .|0
The acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. The writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this???|1
If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman dumps Ripe on us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is this?|1
"mark walhberg in a great role , idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs , and he also seems to like his movies more than his people . "" i do n't think i could have said what i said if my brother had been standing in front of me - that he wanted to make love to me . but it 's not about sex or even being able to be intimate with a boy . it 's about sharing a place that is truly special to both of us for one very different reason ."|0
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced one really good episode...The Damned Thing...it is still early, I have faith that the episodes will get better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline. The episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring, but the last fifteen minutes was really good. Though, I am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed. Please, save this season John Carpenter!|1
the calu - what now ? yeah , i thought it was a stupid name as well . chris carter remains blissfully ignorant from his own family history in america and does nothing out of the ordinary , but that 's all he ever does . i got him to agree on a movie , which has been popular for years . so far , since we have no idea what the movie is called , it is going to be an interesting piece of entertainment . i am thinking it will be one of the most interesting movies of the last four years . i just hope it is worth the time .|0
i ca n ' t explain it , but i find this movie not only funny , but so enjoyable i feel like we should watch it . i mean , there has to be something good about this movie . it seems to me that the only way to get along with the characters in a plot is to let them have their way . i do n't know how you make a film like this for real . every movie needs a lot more people in its life . when i first started working as a production manager , i really had no reason to think things would go any further than this .|0
"Look, this film is terrible... the ""plot"" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. Eventually the kids engineer ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny."|1
this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town . it was one of those movies where everything happened on a daily basis and we were lucky enough to have the film made at the same time . i really enjoyed it . when i got home late at night , i had an extremely strange feeling in my stomach as if something bad was about to happen . i could n't explain it , but i felt that someone was not only coming for me , but also for the rest of the country .|0
my take : steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller , even a film so ridiculous that it seems like a waste of his time , and for the most part it is not ! as i was saying , there 's nothing good about this movie ( if you do not know what a bad actor looks like with his clothes on , then you are right ) . well , let us just say that i am one of the last ones to see this movie since i was given the choice .|0
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley).Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children.|1
Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and Catholics will just holler.Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn.|1
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French way. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age, full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture).|1
The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic (and, in some respects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives.|1
Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good.|1
"Well, at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in America, they now discovered they could simply hire the Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. That's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! ""The Messengers"" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the Oriental countries ever since ""Ringu""."|1
the good things first : i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene in which this is an interesting thing to be seen but also to be seen . i think it is hilarious and makes the movie sound better . you can see where i would have been proud to be on the stage of one of these films . my name is mark cunningham , and i am the director . this is all about making sure people get what they want , as well as being nice to make them feel at ease .|0
tumbling doll of flesh ( aka niku daruma and psycho : the snuff reels ) this was on my want list for the film i 'm planning to see . it is one of my best films ever made , and i hope that when i write this movie it will be able to contain more than three hundred characters . i thought that if i got a chance to see it i would get excited enough to watch it . there really are not many options in this sort of writing as it is not even remotely possible to figure out how to frame the story with just one script .|0
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First off a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. Finally, It introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.A new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving.|1
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site.|1
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn't seen or even heard of.Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.|1
"I found West Point to be an agreeable film, although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's ""Huddle"" (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking."|1
Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it.|1
I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.There were other problems.|1
This was a excellent movie. I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain. I also purchased the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my son's teachers watch it also.I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it. Thank You, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's.|1
I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore.|1
"This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems. We also know he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots. Examples which I am fond of include, ""Dark Star,"" ""O.C. & Stiggs,"" and ""Popeye."""|1
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The ill-fated Payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the African jungle where she lives on husband Cavanaugh's plantation: doctor Conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman Burr's approach is, quite literally, more hands-on.|1
i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed . it is a big place with many rooms , a huge dining room , a kitchen and large bedrooms . i do not think anyone has ever had to go upstairs for this much work . the only reason i am here today is to make sure they do not run into any bad guys that are trying to hurt anyone else . you can imagine all the stuff that was supposed to happen here when it comes time for this movie to be released .|0
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice.|1
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like. Most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it adds up to make a perfect story. All the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough.|1
writer / director john milius takes a little - known incident from american history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways . the film is one of the most hilarious movies that ever existed . it seems to have something to do with world war i and the destruction of the western world and how it would be handled if you did n't want to use it . also , the plot is atrocious . for an actor like me , it 's hard to imagine what people think when they watch the movie . but the actors were very well - mannered and polite and had a nice quality to their performance .|0
i was surprised to like this movie since i ' m from the ` ` check your brain at the door and watch a film , ' so i have no interest in it as a full - time job . that is until one night , when i found myself sitting in the back room of a local bar with two other girls , who were talking about some tv program they had seen . while i enjoyed watching this show , i couldn ' t figure out what was so great about it . if anyone could do it , then it was not me .|0
"This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen, with ""Lessons for an Assassin"" on the #2 spot.The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible! ), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one."|1
How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary!|1
"The 1998 version of ""Psycho"" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because ""it was air conditioning."" I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen)."|1
clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands , but given uwe boll ' s track record it would have been very bad . the first day he left the house was like every other one of his days . the kids are all so happy about having a new parent that they do n't want anything to do with the movie . the only time you get to see this movie is when they start playing it on their dvr ( which never happens ) . i will admit that i did not watch it at first , but after watching it awhile , i started to enjoy myself .|0
this review is for the uk dvd three - disc box set . disc one is called caught in the act and can be easily reused if you like . i have an original copy in my office where it was written and edited by me . there are about 20 episodes which are all based on a fictional character , so i think i may have given up on the film . i thought i would wait ' til after the production to see what will come of it , but that 's not going to happen until next month . the only thing i need now is a little time before it ends again .|0
okay , now i know where all those boring cop / homicide tv shows came from . i do believe they can put together a real good movie based on a bunch of bad stuff . it really does sound great but how do i tell you these things ? there are many things in this film that could make even the worst horror flick look like something that will have fun . and the only thing that would help is for me to see it through my eyes so i can understand what the actors were saying . no one else has ever seen it .|0
If a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere.|1
Well, I have been to a British University, in fact I went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. This is a horrible, badly made and acted film. Worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true British Students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics???|1
2005 will go down in ' dr . who ' history as its most incredible year . everything seemed to click ; a couple of interesting events , then one of these guys comes into your world . i ' ll give her an example . they ' re not that different from other people , and have similar interests . but this guy ( or whatever he was ) shows no interest in writing about his career . the only difference is that he ' s not the director of a movie . if it didn ' t make any sense , then none of them were really paying attention to it .|0
young writers , young auteur , young cast , busload of producers , what could go wrong ? everything . all those people who should be there for me . . . they are not . . . . i am sorry . . . i would like them to stay , but i understand if you wish to see them . in fact that is the first time i thought it had something to do with the movie . however , this is a very long - drawn - out plot which has only one purpose . . . to break down some old memories .|0
at least for me . i have been following the career of mr . almdovar since the beginning and i was told that he is a very good looking man with long curly hair , a broad jaw , and an engaging nature . but now i discover that what i really like about mr . almdovar is his smile . it seems like he always has to hold on to the most painful things in life for as long as it will take him to be able to smile . there is no humor in this man - if only you could laugh .|0
almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie . from the misjudged , often incomprehensible script onwards dr okocha is the only man who actually has a chance of making this movie better . i would also like to point out that he is the one who created this masterpiece . there are at least two other characters on this screen and i believe i know one of them as it is a very intelligent actor - no wonder the film seems so far - fetched . however , all i can say about the acting was that it was bad .|0
after a very scary , crude opening which gives you that creepy ` ` chainsaw massacre ' ' - feeling , everything falls apart . the theme of the movie starts off as a small town in northern wales . it was just a quaint little town that grew up around the great danes and the rest of the british empire , but at the age of 15 , there are about 50 villages that are still on the market for their produce . this film is a big waste of my time . it sounds like an overdramatized drama , but what could possibly be worse than this ?|0
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite storyline. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies.|1
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking.|1
"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke? ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters."|1
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''A good Movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''.|1
a buster keaton silent short . poor buster becomes the goat ( ` ` scapegoat ' ' ) for a dangerous escaped murderer . this is a terrible story , not even remotely funny , and it gets more and more ridiculous by the minute . as i explained to you when we first met , i am very sick of this kind of movie . if you want to see any scenes from this film , you go back in time , or at least one of them . but i find this movie to be unamusing . it seems like a complete waste of time .|0
. . . the last time i laughed this much . it ' s a testament to the talent of rowan atkinson that she can do it . there is just something about the way she deals with her life that makes me like her better . the only problem is that when i first saw her , her face seemed so empty , like someone had taken her place in the world . as soon as we got on the elevator , our eyes were drawn to the little blue bottle on the floor near the railing . it still looked like a good - bye gift from michael .|0
we all enjoyed the movie . it is a very charming family film with many fun cameos . it was a great movie and even had a nice set of scenes in it . the actors were nice . that is not what makes the movie good . you see , the main character did not know how to use a gun and would not kill anyone . this movie was so bad that he did not have a lot of luck . i wanted to make it worse for him by showing off my acting skills . this movie was not a particularly good idea . i liked the characters though .|0
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a lower class Northern British setting. I find it a very sad film at parts, at others cuts are where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie. I only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end.This movie completely loses the attention of the audience.|1
do n ' t look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a lot of publicity . not because it does anything . but simply because it seems to be getting bigger and bigger . you know , i remember when there was this movie on the entertainment channel about this film which we have n't seen much of for the last several years . i just watched it a few months after i received my commission . it has been more than three years since i last saw the movie , but i still like watching it .|0
` ` problem child ' ' was an okay movie , but did it really merit a sequel ? i do n ' t understand why you are asking me the obvious . i just don ' t read too many romance books . if we were on a planet where women and men came together every day , there might be some interesting characters in this movie . i am afraid i have no clue who they are , or why they are being treated so rudely . all i can remember is that they were in the mood to laugh . the story does not go very well with these two young men .|0
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (I may get to watch another one, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is out). For all star John Carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all! ; James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's manservant.|1
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.|1
"the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate ( i . e . ground , air , fire , temperature , wind etc . ) . "" this ' s the second book that has ever made it out of my box . when you ' ve read one of the first books in the marine corps , know that this movie will have been written before the end of the 1940 ' s . while the movie was just about the most interesting thing i have ever watched , i still had a lot of trouble understanding why those two characters were able to do this and then get killed ."|0
this movie was beyond awful , it was a pimple on the a * s of the movie industry . that is why we were there to watch it ! as you can plainly see , the whole thing is very funny . when the movie started out , i knew who it was , and i knew what it was about ; i thought i was going to pass out from the sheer terror of watching this movie . as soon as i stepped onto the stage , i felt a warm tingling sensation spread through my body , as if i had been given an amazing shot of adrenaline .|0
This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule.|1
Wow! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) Terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. Lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film.|1
the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only ` ` star power ' ' if we can call it a role at all is a fake . i have to admit that it was slightly more funny than the one i had just watched ( and which is pretty darn good ) . you can see it in the sequel , so why should it make for a good story ? also , i just hope that the character will eventually get around to realizing what they were really up against when they attempted to escape their prison .|0
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and ""the Wizard Of Oz""."|1
i ' ve always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and i ' ve come across a number of similar examples of this in many of the films i have seen . some of them are as ridiculous as the movie themselves , for one thing they look like they had no idea who or what they were talking about , and for another it would have been nice if they had been aware of the fact that there was actually an entire genre of characters in the movie , not just those on the screen .|0
"it ' s hard and i did n ' t expect it . . . but it ' s really the worst film , me and my friends don ' t know why they are there at all . we didn ' t even know they were there at all , "" he shook his head and continued in a deep voice . "" one of my favorite scenes is the opening scene to this awful film that was made with a fake name . . . i don ' t know how to write this story down . . ."|0
the first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home . it was great because i love being with them and they have been so nice to me . but i still have a bad feeling about this show that i do not want to see again . please give me more time to prepare for the second episode , which will probably end up being worse than the first . there is absolutely no guarantee that it will be anything special . we are not going to expect much , and as far as i am concerned , these are just like movies .|0
based on a fairly bland ` ` best seller , ' ' this film - like most other lifetime movies - played in its own special way by the very rich who made it . ' ( you should know this ; there are some good reasons for that to be in your favor . ) not only do you provide the opportunity for this movie , but you make sure that people get an excellent story , and that is just how it should be . what i will say is that this film was created by my dad , with his help , which is why i had such a hard time writing it down .|0
"is this a good movie ? no , certainly not . but for jolie lovers it ' s must - have . her father is one of the best movies in the country , and he won ' t ever let her go to an amusement park without him along .

"Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as ""a gherkin in a burger"". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die."|1
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue, to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle!|1
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made??|1
after five years in prison , tony le stephanois ( jean servais ) meets his dearest friends jo ( carl mcmillian ) , a beautiful girl , and a wonderful boyfriend . both of them start to get married in december , and she has a great life in california until her father steals it away from her . she decides to move back to hollywood to finish college . she gets her bachelor 's degree at berkeley , and discovers she loves photography , and wants to take pictures of the country . but when her fiancé finds out who she really is , he begins to love her and tries to leave her for good .|0
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines????? ), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film."|1
as jennifer denuccio used to say on square pegs , ` ` gag me out the door . ' ' i would like to make a statement here and there about how good we are at what we do . i do n't know whether or not we are good enough to win this movie so far but i hope you will let my opinion count for something . that movie is an ugly , disgusting , self - destructive horror movie in which it explores certain things that have happened over the years : people , countries , places , sex , drug addictions and other forms of prostitution .|0
I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed. The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it.|1
before we start , may i say i hope you ' ve already eaten when you ' re reading this . why do people really think they have to eat when they can drink and drink ? well if you didn ' t like this film i don ' t think i should tell you what happened . it seemed to be good for you , but at the very least it wasn ' t funny or amusing - just horrible . i liked it from the start , and was so excited about finding the book that i could hardly stand it .|0
It's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. There just isn't a lot to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs.Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here. He's not one I would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. He's a fine actor, anyway.Everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. That was a surprise.|1
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who ' s a real bastard and he wants to launch himself off the surface of the globe to make his world famous . so what do you think ? it looks good on the film , but it is not as good as i thought it would be , and i have seen many films in my career , but this one makes me uncomfortable . there are no lines and the actor seems to have an even greater confidence in his work . he ' s obviously very self - assured and self - deprecating .|0
"this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths . well written by shane black , the film is executed in a beautiful modern style on the second floor . it leaves me wondering what type of character would have come out on stage if it wanted to . i ca n't see how they got so good . i wish it was an action plot or any of the movies i have read . maybe i will watch this film for a long time . as i walked through the lobby i heard someone say "" oh ! my . god ! she is hot .

i watched it because my friend said we could try it , when my father asked if we ' d watch it because you ' re in a better mood . we didn ' t go to the movies because he ' d get really mad if he saw this movie . but we all went anyway . no one would give us that much of an excuse because we had not paid any attention to it . it is just too depressing . i spent the whole night staring up at the ceiling and wondering what the hell i was thinking .|0
"Dire! Dismal! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing!Right, your trapped in ""The Cave"" with several ""hard"" Men and a Woman or two, your being systematically killed by ""Something"" and you STILL don't get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A 15 Cert' here in England, and you could tell!The Egos of the ""Macho Men"" was just too much, pass the bucket I'm going to be sick.This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever."|1
* * might contain spoilers * * ok , lets conclude this movie in one word : bad . two years ago , it would never have come to this but i could n't resist ! the best part is that when i took the film , i did n't even look forward to the ending . it 's like being shot down by a robot . if i had to choose between the first five or six minutes of this film , i would choose not to see this movie at all . i just ca n't believe that there was so little time for the actors to make the entire movie go through and through .|0
it ' s another variation on the oft - told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of young children . i can ' t say for sure that they did either , although there have been many a memorable evening or two . however , this was not an experience i truly enjoyed . i found myself thinking how very different my life might have turned out if i had lived in a town as large as new jersey . i never saw so many big city towns like new york , illinois and los angeles together .|0
all right , let me start by saying i love the original rs for the 64 . the graphics were excellent , so it was nice to see that they paid a good price for this film . ok , i also wanted to mention that the original version is quite bad , and i hope you like this movie . although i am trying hard not to show off too much , i have got to say something . what i 'm about to say has to do with the time of the movie . i watched it after i finished reading the final manuscript and made a very poor decision regarding the current subject matter .|0
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash, some knowledge of movie making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors, and a lot of determination, yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free. Thankfully, I found it in a discount bin somewhere.|1
as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie ( keeping it kid friendly ) fx was really bad , and we all went out to watch the movie before it became a horror story . by the fourth episode , i could n't see any reason for the film to be terrible . they were so full of bullshit , like they were thinking that they did their best to stay in the good old usa . when they started talking about going back to canada to make more films , i just could not get over the fact that these people would do anything for money .|0
"this is the worst movie in the world . the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the character said something weird like "" what did i ever do that you needed to know ! ? "" when i tried to tell them that i loved it , they did n't believe me . there were some very interesting moments , but no one really knew what happened . at least i think there was some good moments here and there , but i ca n't even remember what happened . it was so frustrating watching it , i just could n't wait to see if it would end ."|0
caution spoiler : at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after they started the movie , which is an extremely unfortunate ending . there were very few positive comments as the story went on , and even fewer reactions from the critics . what do you think we should do then ? i 've never seen anything like this in films before . some people claim to see a ghost , but i could not say who was wrong . i have spent the last three weeks doing research on this topic and can not think of a single thing remotely appropriate for the show .|0
Firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. Thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourthly, once a SECOND member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college PRESIDENT will disband the whole class, and NOT turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!|1
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars???|1
much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to r dogs made on a film ( but that ' s not very important when you ' ve been there and know all along who ' s playing who , etc . ) the main point is that if you ' ve spent your whole life trying to prove something , then you should be able to see where it would lead . what we can ' t ' t figure out is how someone could fail at something so simple as making an impression on their characters .|0
I'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. I'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because I'll be here for ages if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience.|1
this is a stereotype plot . a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and fails because of his inability to get inside the gym . finally , the fighter succeeds and is defeated by an unknown person who decides that he would like to take it on . this is just a very bad example of what will happen in the future . there really are only two people who have a real problem with the premise . first of all , the character dies , but then comes back . this sucks . as soon as i heard about this film , i thought it had a positive ending .|0

I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.|1
i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three . i did some swell editing work and enjoyed my film , but when the credits came up i had no idea it would end this quickly . i do have to say that i spent an inordinate amount of time on that film over the last seven or eight months . i loved it , but could not go through with it ( if i actually did enjoy it ) so i had to write the screenplay . it was good enough for me to start looking forward to seeing the movie every weekend .|0
i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid , waiting for dr . who . i 'm not proud of that movie . there are some things we can do and other things we ca n't , but this movie was the toughest one i have ever watched . to my knowledge it has only made me feel a little more nervous about it . the next few months pass in a blur . as much as i enjoy writing , i love watching movies with the characters and their personalities . if you ask me how they get together , i will be willing to describe them .|0
"Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the ""mentor"" and the ""talented immature pupil"". The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate."|1
Watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau.|1
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!!|1
oh boy ! oh boy ! on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her boyfriend , but it is nothing compared to the actual movie itself . i have not seen that movie ( as you can see from my perspective , it was rather pathetic ) so i decided to watch this dvd in a different light . there was an episode with a girl and she 's trying to get a kiss from someone who looks like she would be good enough for him but does n't deserve the attention he will give her in the first place .|0
"Dude...I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. The worst lead actress EVER!! Not even David ""Hot Pants"" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I NEVER watch Fox  it blows!! We totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. We watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. I want to kill the execs at the network SO BAD! Why is money being spent on this drivel?!?!"|1
"This is almost Ed Wood territory. Yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. And that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that ""anti-matter"" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie."|1

"For those viewers who thought the 1979 film ""Alien"" the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, ""Night of the Blood Beast,"" made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise.

"a kooky , but funny bit of diversion . you kind of have to see it from the beginning to get the picture . i knew this was a good idea on some level when i started thinking about it . as a little kid , i watched a movie where an old lady in her fifties comes up to the old woman with a piece of paper that says she has to speak to her in order to convince her to go back home . ' we love you , "" the woman says before handing the note over to the old lady . """|0
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know...but how good is it? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****SPOILER****When a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow.|1
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not too good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. If you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. It's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was titled HOSTAGE.|1
"This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself ""this is going to be really good"". However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. The problem, not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner."|1
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. It's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death.|1
i happened across this movie while channel - surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly - made christian film about the people in this movie who are just trying to do something for their country . i thought it might be good for some of those people here , but they did n't understand that there is only so much you can go through before you get lost . the first part of the film was about an elderly woman who had a son who was having a bad night . she was alone in her house with two cats ( both of which looked like kittens ) and a small dog on her porch .|0
the great thing about thirst , chanwook park ' s latest film , is that it ' s the anti - twilight . some would say this movie ' s not very much different from what i thought it would be . at least you can tell there was a bit of a buzz when they came onto the scene , especially since most of the scenes were just so sad . but if you ' ve seen these movies before and really want to see them again , don ' t worry . it ' s actually quite interesting , too . as i mentioned before , the acting is incredibly boring for me .|0
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die.|1
( this has been edited for space ) chan - wook park ' s new film is a complex film that is not very clever at all . there are a lot of errors while the premise and character are pretty easy , and the director does have a great job with the acting . however when i read the play , i found it hard to believe that an actor as big as chan actually could be so good . in fact , i do n't know if it even had a real title . it certainly was n't part of the original plays . the whole thing made my stomach churn .|0
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says. Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. He's not evenfrom Flint. He just says that to keep his ""blue collar"" look. He's from a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean he went to a private school.His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, that sure does seemlike they suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there."|1
One of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as a implied Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in McDonalds.Hitler isn't mentioned by name, since America wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!There seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's.|1
"I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire"". To begin, I'd say that ""Water"" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of ""heat"" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships."|1
the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick . sadly it ' s very bad , and i would love to watch this , but alas no one will have the energy to make it . it ' s been so long since you heard anything of the supernatural in this town , that i just couldn ' t believe how much it resembled a movie . it ' s the sort of story that gets me off the hook , as well as making me want to see my favorite movie .|0
Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.|1
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey.|1
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good Saturday night movie. I wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.The dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character.|1
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film.|1
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film. It is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake. Or, perhaps, their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart; looking for any reason at all to dislike them?The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action film, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself.|1
emilio estevez takes the wonderful play homefront and makes it into an engaging movie . the war at home has an exceptionally strong plot twist , making it seem to be just as uninspired as it truly is . i never saw a movie like that ever in my life . i would give my right nut to go to disney world when i was a kid and see if there were any of those movies where people can do things without getting involved with them . it is very hard not to get involved with the bad guy .|0
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn't mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.|1
oh my god , why , did i waste my precious time on this film ? it is pathetic , you see . it seems to have nothing to do with science or the work of an alien . all they need is a little more than a few scientific tests and there will be no reason to even try to write a book . i should n't expect anything else from this film that is too ridiculous to make it any less ridiculous . for the record , the movie was made in 1992 . the first part of the production was done shortly after the release of the film .|0
this is a very , very odd film . . . one that is so odd it ' s best you just see it because it has the worst acting ability ever seen in the movies at all . i don ' t have a good look at it and i was looking forward to a quiet movie night . if i were a little older and had more money i would probably go out to the movies and try to make some money for myself . i thought about making a movie and wanted to put it somewhere but i could n't figure out why people would think such an idea was funny .|0
"I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated college and moved on to ""real life"". I was not in a fraternity, but a lot of my best buddies were, and I got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house, so I know what goes on to some extent.This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or college life for that matter, although it does hold a lot of truth, albeit exaggerated for the most part."|1
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have had her kids taken away by the Department of Children and Families. Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me.|1
"as i looked at this movie once again , i think it belongs among hitchcock ' s greatest films . the first few lines are pretty boring - and then a bunch of things just sort of fall off in the middle of the scene . "" what is the meaning of this ? where am i going to start ? do you know why they want me to be the lead actor for the show ? "" i ' m not really sure . i guess the main thing that caught my attention were all the strange comments and movies on the screen ."|0

"" it was n't hard to answer that . i mean really , who would n't want to be a super hero ? even after all this time , we just do n't know what is real , what will happen , and how to act on it . if there is anyone in this room that wants to help this guy escape , it would be me . well , maybe not now ."|0
i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem , except to say that it represents young buster . his love for the outdoors and how it all came about , which he did well , is something i am not very proud of . i do n't know if you have read this one yet , but buster seems to make a good movie adaptation . i actually felt inspired by this one , although i never really thought i would . i 'm still quite shocked when i read this on my first day at the post .|0
"Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder ""Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?"" For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine ."|1
having watched this movie several times , i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring film - and it was an extremely bad one . what is wrong with me ? i am supposed to be helping them in this movie ! how could someone act like this when they knew so many of their friends had been killed as a result ? i can not comprehend why people do these stunts if they just do it because they are poor . i mean , it would not be difficult to figure out why people do this . well , the answer is obvious : some people do things for fun .|0
"That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this ""film"". I couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped.The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. The daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.Thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting I've witnessed.As for the stock footage... well at first one...Wait.Why am I reviewing this film?"|1
Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I was misled after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. Even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time on this one. This movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera.|1
we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age , with the result that most of you already know . but i do n't really care where you 're from . for instance , why does it take so long to get a picture of a movie like this ? it should have taken about 5 minutes or more to get here . and on top of that , all the things that could have had a chance of happening happen . now there are not many good things that can happen to me , even if one of them was an awesome movie .|0
while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years , there have always been rivals to their own movie and i have never seen this . this is no film at all . it is something else . it reminds me of other movies i had seen before in new york city . but this is a different kind of ' movie ' from the one i just saw . here , you ca n't even get close enough to see what they are doing on the stage . the characters are not funny or interesting . they are just plain old people trying to create a great horror flick .|0
This is one of the most laughably bad films I've ever seen. I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was connected with making it. It doesn't have anything going for it. There is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project.|1
"Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. I hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC's ""Best of Britain"" series."|1
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work.|1
"Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know about Harry Nilsson do a little research and you'll see that Harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special ""The Point"" or ""Everybody's Talking"" from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with ""people let me tell you bout my best friend"" - the theme song from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."""|1
"i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of innocents , which in most cases could have been more dramatic . "" so , what do we know about the sex of the dead ? "" i 'm not even sure why i asked . i 've only seen the dvd twice , and it seems like every movie that has ever come out of one of those films sucks . for all i know this is the fifth horror flick in the series . it 's an old sitcom with just about any plot ."|0
Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting.|1
i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue in a very different language from what i 'd expected . it does n't matter though ; we 've just spent a great amount of time on this subject . i 'm sorry but i had no idea that people were talking about these sorts of thing . even if you ask me , they all said the same things : ' look at how far out of control this country really is . our government seems completely unaware that the united states is an integral part of its history .|0
cruddy , innocent . . no smoking , drinking or bikers , but jeremy slate ( good actor ) and jocelyn rosenberger are also not the most attractive women on the planet . in a sense , as i said before , it all happens to you . there are a few minor moments that you do just what you always do - get out of bed at 6 am and go straight to town for an hour or two of retail therapy . the main drawback is that they seem to waste your time and make you feel obligated to talk about yourself .|0
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama, White Mama.In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one.|1
everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched . . . . well maybe it is . but at least you know what kind of movie this was . the script was so funny that i just could not understand why my friends would ever agree to do it . if you were going to use a tv show on a movie site , there must have been a whole bunch of things wrong with that . no matter where you get an idea , you have to try and pick them off from the top .|0
"Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the ""Dekalog"" but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure.The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5)."|1
". . . a true geek - girl ' s dream : high tech , high drama , smart guys , steamy sex , and hot guys with the best intentions . what an awesome plot hole for a great story ! it was so good that i have to sit back and reflect on how i got it . one day i went out to buy some cigarettes and saw this gorgeous woman sitting in my car watching me . "" who are you ? "" she asked rudely .

"in 1929 , director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the movie , i 'm surprised at how much fun it really was . if you had seen this film on the internet a time or two , would you like to see more ? here is "" the show of the century .

 some years after we started looking for the real aliens , we discovered the ufo that took off into space . we have watched this movie over and over for months ."|0

as i read the script on - line , i thought ` ` capote ' ' needed a trim . having just seen it , i felt this was an excellent shot , and i was surprised at how good the shoot was . one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in my whole life seemed to be that ' capote ' is really a character from a movie about a guy who has taken a vow of poverty in order to live in a state of poverty with no place to live . they are always making jokes about how their parents do not love them enough to stay in the same house .|0
this was one of the slowest movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through . after the introduction , it took about fifteen minutes to do the part where i go out of my way to save a person . that is until i saw something else that made it seem like there was something wrong with me . i knew it all along , so what did it matter ? i know the movie was very old , but still . . . no one in their right mind would even attempt to get on this film .|0
for this movie , based off of a tv show , and a serious finale . i thought that it could n't be much worse . i mean , the movie was funny as hell but you do n't find any good comedies here . this one is actually a little bit like the rest of the bad ones . there is a very old man on a fishing boat floating on a lake about to drown , while he is trying to rescue a woman from drowning in a small pond . when he tries to rescue her he is unable to catch her because she is still alive .|0
so keira knightly is in it . . . so automatically we compare this film to attonement . aside rom the fact that this one is n't very original , i think most people have just been waiting for the movie to be published because they really feel it was a good story and are looking forward to working out the plot of it . there 's an element of horror in the story that makes me want to take a turn at watching it , but if i do , i lose my temper . . . or maybe i should say i lose my temper .|0

I cant believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. Thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer Simpson making a movie about a doughnut!|1
Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. It was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later.|1
"what crack are you smoking ? this movie , while gloriously entertaining , is awful ! the action scenes are so dull and uninteresting they would make some of the horror i have just read very much less inspiring . "" we all thought it a little weird how people could be so depressed about the ending of such a stupid movie when they were obviously enjoying it even if it was boring . maybe it was in an attempt to distract themselves from the boredom , or perhaps by focusing on other problems instead of doing something good . whatever the case , it did not get any better than this movie ."|0
i only wish that i had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when i knew it would make me sound like a total idiot . even if i did , though , i probably would have just turned it off . there is nothing better than seeing one of those cheesy movies with lots of drama and some awful scenes involving people doing horrible things . as long as you take the time to see it , you 'll find out how terrible the scene really is . if you do n't listen to the bad ones , you ca n't believe your eyes ( which are usually quite boring ) .|0
every time i ' ve seen this movie i get the same impression : some parts of it are so amazingly good , the actors are so lame , and all they can think about is how to save themselves . when i first saw this movie i was sure that there was a real problem , but now as i look at the movie i find that this movie was pretty much just an epic fail in my opinion . if you did not like the movie you would understand why i could not have come up with anything better to write about .|0
In Michele Soavi's confusing art-house zombie film, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long. Aided by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade.However, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred, Francesco finds himself busier than ever beforeHaving garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officianados, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.|1
A young couple decides to runaway to sunny California. They never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the Rest Stop.After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. When she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you may ask?|1
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I didn't want to watch it, but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime.They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated more.Not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around.|1
THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars)Pretty poor movie... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his inept son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life. After throwing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I guess is *never* going to act in anything other than TV movies or low budget direct-to-video trash ever again) is called to the scene.|1
"This is, arguably, the worst of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous. But that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he's Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (! ), and Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a major popular song, ""Speak Low."""|1
"This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps? ), attacking model trains and toy cars. The ""science"" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? And what's up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from ""some god-forsaken anti-matter universe"", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in New York."|1
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... The film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... If this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... As for the actual film, I recommend watching the MST3K version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother...|1

This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I would think you could get that from the title. Also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when. Only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. Good luck finding it at your local store though. I doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution.|1
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber. The film makers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie, and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory collection of poppycock. I almost started rooting for the mexicans, just to get the damn thing to end.|1
one of my favorite movies . i like horses , i like happy endings , and i like walter matthau . but even if you were to look at these episodes from the end of the movie and know there was more than just one guy , it would still be hard to believe that he would have a heart - to - heart talk with a girl about her father . i also like the characters . they are so cute and innocent looking that they do n't deserve to be treated so bad . this is the only time that people actually care about their characters ( or their family ) .|0
"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie."|1

yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on fire for no reason at all , but then there are the zombies . if that were really what happened , then why did some of these idiots say it was just a bad movie because it was horrible ? i do like this film , even if it is not my favorite one . the other thing that seems to make sense in this situation is that there is no such thing as an original movie . you see , the premise has always been the same .|0
jerk hazer mike ( david zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die ? ) . a couple of his friends , who were from san francisco , are in on the act , and make the entire scene seem even worse than it really is . they do n't even try to sound funny , which is just as well . i could use a good laugh , especially since i have only been back for three hours , and already i feel that i 'm running low on energy and my body feels tired and sick .|0
A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton)stumble onto the town of Gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of King's best short stories. In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful.|1
"this was gene kelly ' s breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable . throw in rita hayworth as his favorite movie author and i might have had a little trouble fitting in with that genre . there were many good movies , the most important one of all , which is something to see right up until the very end . let me give you an example :

The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.There's two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy.|1
one of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that they always think there is more to life . i can tell you that at least 50 , 000 people spent their entire lives watching reality show reruns of a new year , only to find out that the program had nothing on the real world and was simply making them bored . i 'm not sure why they thought they were getting a free show in the first place . maybe they thought the show was stupid , or maybe it was just very good .|0
the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film . after years of being on the stage , i have to say i like the play . it is really pretty good and makes you feel like you 've just stepped into some very bad action movie . so much has happened during these past few years and i am a little worried that i will never get back what i had lost . well , not much actually . i was an aspiring actress who spent every spare moment going out for coffee with her new boyfriend .|0

"If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on Cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you ARE on the Internet, after all).But whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH ""CHE!"". Unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.All the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave ""Che!"" their vote for worst film of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this travesty?"|1
this movie was extremely disappointing , i thought it would be another ' marijuana comedy ' but do n ' t be mislead . this movie had an interesting dynamic and a good amount of character , even though i have read that there are so many characters involved . i found myself trying to talk to the person on the other end of the line without success , so i looked for a way to reach out to him or her . my first reaction is to just throw it all away and try to find some kind of solution .|0
I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet).|1
personally , i have no problem with the acting , nor the script . i do have a problem with it . if you had n't been on the set and seen this movie , i would have lost all of my respect for you . however , i like what you have done and am glad that you got to watch it . i enjoy every second of this movie and i want to continue it . i will not discuss the sex scene or any of the sex scenes , but i wish that you could have watched the rest . i really enjoyed it as i watched it .|0
rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour - - she ' s one of the dancing girls in this film . she was n't so bad , either . her acting is a lot better than that of other girls . i thought she was good , but now i ' m getting tired of listening to it all . if you want to talk about what happened back in 1987 , just check in with me on smashwords : i would have been happier if you kept asking me questions and then making fun of me like you did back then .|0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film. In the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. Despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama.|1
` ` prime suspect 4 ' ' continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice , detective steve traylor . as is the case with these crimes , one can not blame them on a story that seems to have come from someone else who claims to work for an organisation called the secret service . this is not something you see on tv , so much like what you might expect to see on tv . it is too far - fetched to be believable or credible , though i find it extremely plausible at best .|0
this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made . following are the plus points in this film - which is a huge understatement . the first two scenes and then the third were very easy , but it all gets a bit too complicated after that . so what do you think of this movie ? it does n't really look as appealing as any i have ever seen before . the actors seem to be more focused and their acting is more interesting than the rest of the movie . the only things that bother me are the people that play these roles .|0
wow , there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is . i usually pride myself on my ability to put up with any amount of insanity . not for this film . this movie is all about making it so you can make sense of everything that happens around you . at the same time , the only thing that really matters here is making sure you 're in the wrong place at exactly the right time . the problem with this movie has to do with the first person to enter it . the characters are always the same and the dialogue is the same .|0
"I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. The acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood's actors appear life like. ""Sammy,"" the lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character."|1
i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal movie , because it just does n't seem like what you 'd expect of someone from hollywood . then there are these two guys . one of them is very old and he has a bad attitude that makes him sound like a complete loser , and the other guy ? i do n't know who they 're supposed to be . first off , you probably wo n't see anything of any importance on this film , but you ca n't say for sure that there is n't some significant plot or interesting plot .|0
"This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars Robert Sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name ""Sam Marlowe"". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there."|1
i am sure i ' m in the minority ( i know i am among my friends ) , but i have never felt so lonely as when we first came to live together in the middle east . i would like very much if you were able to talk to somebody about this situation . how long do you think will happen ? there are a few of those people who wish they had never even seen this video . at one time , i thought that this was a good film , but after seeing it twice , i just could not believe that it actually started here and has been playing for many years .|0
"For me, this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles based ""Z"" Channel when it was in service. And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one I did not want to accept.Moving to Los Angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the ""Z"" Channel in its showing of international films."|1
"a bit too much mediterrenean machismo for me . the cast was beautiful , lovely to watch in all of its majesty , and i liked every second of it . it was an excellent performance , but if you do n't like my acting , i would be happy to try something else . "" she had heard these words many times in the past , but she could n't remember ever hearing them actually spoken out loud . maybe this was not so different . there were some people who said they were from the east , but in fact , they were from the north ."|0
i could watch this movie all day ! i love it . probably my all time favorite movies . but i really want to stay and watch this movie and not be disappointed with the movie . i am very interested in the story , which has an amazing ending for the first time and is so unrealistic that i would give it a chance if i had just watched it earlier . the movie was as bad as the book . the actors were completely useless . the characters were so dumb that i could n't tell if there was anything funny about either of them .|0
This movie had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However, it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.|1
` ` de dominee ' ' is based on the life of a real dutch gangster , klaas bruinsma ! in the early 1980 's , he went off to france to meet a french lover . he died in an american prison during his tour of duty in france . you know the kind of stuff that happens in prisons . when he came back from paris , he spent two nights in jail and was released the next morning . i found out that this guy was actually a really good actor but could n't do any much more than stand there and stare at the movie screen with a smile on his face .|0
the storyline of this movie is cliche and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park . the filmmakers did n't realize it would be a great story but they tried to put the plot in the wrong place and fail miserably . the characters all looked as though they were trying to look cool , well that is pretty much why they did . there is no rhyme nor reason to what the actors were doing . you must understand that not only was their acting inept , but their acting performance was atrocious . this film could have easily gone better .|0
Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn't the worst I've ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I've mentioned.Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.Does this make sense...no?|1
i have viewed this cartoon as a child , a father , and now a grand - father . it is my most fervent regret that the children of my first generation are having to work for a man they hardly know . at times it is like being around someone who truly knows how to be a great actor , and then when he is in the middle of his acting , he gets so angry that he just takes off . i once thought this was funny until i came to see how many people had to put their life on hold to become a great actor .|0
"Sorry about the ""extremely clever"" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help myself.I've been meaning to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten."|1
this was a great film in every sense of the word . it tackles the subject of tribadism in a huge way . for example , when i wrote this about my sister , she and i spent a lot of time together during that time . but it was not until recently that we discovered how similar the story really is to the original . the main reason why they did this was to get me to like it on film . now i understand why someone who is very good at all these films wanted to make this movie . there were many things more satisfying to watch on television than this .|0
how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar - worthy film ? ! mosthly martha is much more better , and i see no reason for me to doubt that the movie should get well done . as you will see here , in the mid - 19th century this film had a pretty good ending with lots of good characters , decent dialogue , and plenty of sex . but in fact , it has not been one of the best movies i have ever seen . when i first saw this film i was so disappointed in myself , especially after my mother died .|0
Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. At the final scene, I was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.Only one name in it I ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must've been very hungry to take this part.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! !|1
i watched the this the other night on a local station because i did n ' t feel like watching tripe like that , so i didn ' t . it is a bad comedy , and as much fun as it is to watch it , this one has not been played in over 40 years . it ' s sad . i don ' t even like the characters ; they are simply too predictable , but this one really gets you with all those plot holes . the main character is a very old - fashioned male of thirty - five years old who lives in the suburbs of washington state .|0
This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.|1
"take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then warners . in 1995 , the studio director called me to his office because i was supposed to be there . i did not know what to expect . the meeting had been an enormous success and they seemed to have some very high ratings on the tv screen . after a short period of conversation , the interview began . the interviewer asked "" where is your wife , sister , and daughter ? "" he answered "" they are both dead . """|0
back in the 70 ' s , a small - time texas filmmaker named s . f . brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent screenplays but it has only been about 15 years since i was on the film scene . this movie is supposed to be a great hit but the cast has just so many characters and their character is not as good as the original . the producers can not believe what they have made . it seems that one of the reasons i love this movie are the actors and the actors seem to enjoy the role . the main point is that the director wants the cast to be perfect .|0
i ' m rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott . i could ' ve done without the female nudity in this movie - but it would be a better movie for the two of us with the guys , who will be laughing at our inability to play a single scene . i am looking forward to this movie , and i hope all of my characters are as hilarious as they were before we went through this film . one of my favorite movies is this movie . however , there ' s something different about this movie when you watch it .|0
Citizen Kane....The Godfather Part II....D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars as Dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. He clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (I myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive.|1
"i rented this type of ` ` soft core ' ' before , but i can honestly say , i was n ' t in a rush to go into anything that might be useful . "" "" you must have been . there is just one thing missing : how much time were you planning to spend here ? "" she asked . 
 "" about six weeks , at the most , "" i said , not really telling her the whole truth . besides , i do n't feel up to explaining why i decided to come all the way over here ."|0
After just viewing the movie, I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film?|1
i was waiting to welcome arnold schwarzeneger ' s return to action after the dismal movies he ' d made after ` ` his own . ' i could have used an oscar , but it didn ' t happen . i should have listened to that movie a while back , and then just stayed in my room until it came along . it doesn ' t make this movie any better , though . all of the character is horribly predictable , with everything from dirty jokes and no - strings romance . i do not even enjoy watching those stupid movies because they remind me of the time when i was a kid .|0
"it ' s hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is funny and that it was so funny when it ' s not , or if it doesn ' t even come close to being funny anymore . i ' ve seen quite a few movies since then , and i got to watch them most of my life . "" he took another long drag from the cigarette . "" as i recall , this movie is just a little scary at the beginning . there were two people in it who made it funny ."|0
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off. Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. As an actor and filmmaker, I cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. Yet, I must admit, I could not look away.|1
this is truly , without exaggerating , one of the worst slasher movies ever made . i know , it was pretty bad . but for a movie where there are so many funny characters that you could have called it a horror flick ( or worse ) , it might have been better . this film was about a young boy who discovers his father murdered in the night and goes looking for the man to save him . unfortunately , after he finds his father , he decides to go see his mother too . this film is much funnier than the first one .|0
"i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go . we were both extremely depressed by the movie and really felt like we needed a change of scenery . i have seen some of these movies before but only on the television shows , so i thought it might be fun to watch them again . one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life is watching an episode of "" in the early 1980s "" called "" in the late ' 70s "" where two young women are kidnapped by another woman ."|0
"Do not see ""Mr. Magoo."" It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny in it. He has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the entire movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have stayed that way."|1
"this short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration . after a session , i would like you to hear this in the following words : 
 "" how can we know if these guys are sincere or if they want to kill us ? there is too much uncertainty . one thing that i have not noticed about this film is that this film is totally lame and has no substance . i just do not understand what the story behind it really is , and what kind of game is being played by these actors ."|0
this movie was alright . mary - kate and ashley play twin sisters ( sorry for stating the obvious ) who against their best friend has to fight to remain in the good graces of her best friend , mary - kate , and make it back home before being forced into a marriage by both her best friends . there was very little humor in the acting , but the characters were interesting nonetheless . if only they would just be honest with one another , then maybe we could all learn some good stuff from them . that would have been my guess though ! oh well .|0
this movie was , of the 67 of 71 best pictures i have seen , by far the worst . it started at ten in the afternoon and went on to take a total of 6 hours . there are lots of great titles , though some are so bad you might find them difficult to read . how many times have you seen it ? not as much as 1 / 2 times . that is one of the things i am grateful for about being in the films because it helps me concentrate on what i want to know . why did these movies be banned from the films ?|0
the four la cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd , and even more hilarious . most of the stories that i have heard are pretty good . after all this time , it would be nice if the story never left the studio . but it did . i do n't know whether or not the story will ever be released . i think it has long since passed the point that it needs to . for the record , i like my job well . there is nothing else to say about it . it 's very boring .|0
this is probably the best movie from director hector babenco . it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners , and it looks good but really has an awful story about people who killed themselves to kill a drug - dealer or so i hear . it makes me laugh when i see how much they just do n't understand what is going on . there was some kind of a shootout in the middle east that ended badly . it did n't exactly take place , but it sure as hell felt like a scene in one of my most hated movies . why would anyone even want to talk about such a thing ?|0
"I have for years remembered a song ""JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE"" (""No. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air""). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. I located a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 year old at the Ligonier PA theatre. I was pleased to find that it had Kenny Gardner the singer with Guy Lombaro (I am a Lombardo fan)."|1
"""Problem Child"" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue."|1
"This telecast of the classic musical ""Sweeney Todd"" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.Firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. Then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.The main failing here is in the performances people give. Oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, ""Kiss Me."""|1
"Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware ""cop-movie parody"", and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not!"|1
why would anyone make a film like this ? why would anybody invest in a film like this ? why would anyone do that to their own best friend , and then have it made out of junk ? the more i get involved with this , the less i want to be a part of anything . no one has ever had a movie this bad in their entire life . if you ask me , the first thing i remember watching was a movie about zombies . oh , they are not bad guys at all . actually , they are just so very stupid !|0
Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of that.So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission.|1
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad. This movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture Christianity as most know it. I am also very surprised because this film is a BBC program and the BBC is quit well known for their quality programing, but it looks like the BBC's attempt to rival the Hollywood psycho/drama films are failing completely. Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion.|1
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence.|1
okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . it ' s difficult to take characters seriously and do much of the talking . i like the story about an ex - soldier who travels with an army in afghanistan . he makes it sound so scary . but , it ' s funny how you don ' t find these things funny any more than other movies that are made to look that way . they are just a little creepy . one night a few hours later , he leaves for a flight to washington , dc .|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not equaled today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer.Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of his mystique. Hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image.|1
alert : this review contains major spoilers . do not read on if you plan to see this film . judging from the previous two reviews , the story is based on the premise and dialogue in this movie . please feel free to recommend this book to other readers . any advice or suggestions were made by me and my wife about how to handle this film . they have done a number of good things and did a lot of good things but we just ca n't really get into them . no matter what type of film you choose , these movies will never go out of style .|0
"i totally agree . this is ` ` pitch black underground ' ' and a well worn plot . the best scenes are all done with light , not shadows . what 's going to happen ?

"" "" okay , so there was this movie that just sort of came to life in the pit of your stomach and went into production . it did n't get any better than that , at least ."|0
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater.|1
"i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election . cbs ' s last shot at throwing a big party took off for the fourth time in less than two weeks , and they were running like it was some kind of horror movie . instead we got this crappy - looking film that looks like it could have been one of the many "" horror "" movies made in the past six months . it 's actually pretty boring if you know what i mean . there are lots of characters that want nothing more than to get their money back from the rich or poor ."|0
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top V.I.P employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible.|1
As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra BS that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. Well...this was that piece of crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. The only half-witted acting came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies.|1
the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy - nilly criss - crosses the lives and time - lines of its characters . this is one of those scenes that looks more like a science show than an actual movie . there is no real scientific reason to expect anything , but when it becomes apparent that these characters are in serious trouble , it makes for a very depressing film . i was surprised to learn from some of the other students at this school not to know about this film , especially since i have always wondered how someone would ' t know about it .|0
ok , this does n ' t compare to the explosive tempo of the first part ' s opening sequence ; nor to the other parts . it is as if the script were a video that was lost in the same time zone and never made its way into any context . i just like to say that most of what i read in this movie is wrong and it ' s hard to find any right words when you come across these three pieces of crap on the cover . this movie will be an early edition , so i am going to recommend it to all the young kids who wanted to see this film .|0
whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke . he might , as some say , not have made it out of this world , but in that case , how can you tell that he actually did get a better deal ? let 's just say he took more risks than i did - and i would appreciate it if there were no such risks in coming out of here on this particular trip . we all know the real reason people put up with this crap is so they can get away with it . my dad thinks this place is bad for me .|0
"I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression."|1
if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared , death in venice would have to be the worst of the worst . there is no way to get rid of this movie or any other horror film , unless it is a particularly scary one that will give you nightmares . this movie has been so stupid that i thought it would be more fun to watch something from a very small town . at least i did not have to try to make myself sick . actually , i am still shocked by how quickly my life turned out .|0
largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman & employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren ' s missing son . at this point , most of the story comes down to what happened : the two men kidnap a young girl and take her with them . she is so distraught by this episode ( as it usually does ) that she gets scared and jumps off the cliff . but no matter how many tricks she tries to pull , nobody can save her . when the kidnappers arrive , they find her dead body dumped on the beach . after all , not one other body was found .|0
forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead . i suppose only institutionalized people will be capable of making such films , but maybe they can make it really funny . i still find it hilarious to watch a movie without an audience , especially when the person in the background is screaming and screaming at all the right times . there are always so many other people that need to be put in their place , who could n't get a good idea of what kind of film was going on .|0
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.Now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.That and no more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood.This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show.|1
i ' ve seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake . as far as the script goes , there ' s no way it can be any better than this one , so you ' ll have to keep asking yourself how many other people could have been inspired by this movie or made the movies . let me just tell you that it doesn ' t really matter if you were inspired or not . i am very good at what i do and i will make sure you remember this .|0
"Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a ""family."" Sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives are coming for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner, explaining ""This is what I wore last Thanksgiving."""|1
i ' ve never understood this type of spoof movies . you get some serious / semi - serious movie that everyone knows about and you laugh it off . but then you get the idea that it comes down to this . what happens in the movie ? where do things really happen ? these people were not just making movies for themselves or acting out a script . they were doing it for me . how can you believe that there is no such thing as god , or at least something like that ? surely there ' s some truth to those claims .|0
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's.|1
bought for £1 , project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . wooden acting , a parody of the classic horror genre ( even though we can use that word in most situations ) . i like to watch this crap because it shows some action , which is nice but does nothing to make the world a safer place to live . i do not understand why people who watch this stuff would go to such trouble to try and show their films to others , especially at the expense of their own safety .|0
i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on . it brings back happy times for me . i grow up in a new town with people coming all over me to say what they think of my acting skills and trying to do the best job i can . but i know i could never be as good - looking as lackawanna . this is so ridiculous ! why does anyone care about my looks ? when i was younger i could n't even look in the mirror , let alone have sex with any girl who would pay me enough money to try and get into my pants .|0
i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti , do not see this movie . if you have , show it to the film editor and maybe you would know what he is looking for . or perhaps you will come to your senses and change your mind . either way it is an incredibly dull book . there are two scenes where both of them make love in a darkened room on a stage while a few other actors are still doing their best to keep up with things going on . first , the scene has been edited so many times that i can easily tell what happened here .|0
Now, lissen you guys, I LOVED THIS FILM, though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor.|1
nurse charlotte beale ( the lovely rosie holotik ) has arrived to dr . stephens ' clinic for the insane prepared her for what she is going to find . there are other interesting things about it . first of all , i must say that this is a very boring story . the people in it are completely out of whack . as for the characters - well , it does look like you could take an elephant by the ears if you would just sit back and enjoy yourself . secondly , the overall content is really dull and boring . they do n't seem to pay much attention to anything .|0
I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, after only just beginning. I looked forward to this show all week long. And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have won. It just began, and in my opinion,it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted, and sat waiting for it to come on; never knowing that it was canceled.|1
i did n ' t know what to expect from this hugely popular ( and hilarious ) swedish comedy & satire team . the only other time i watched it was a movie based on this one , and it made me laugh even though i knew no one could hear me over the sound of music . however , this film makes me laugh again . every time i look at it i think about how good it was when we first saw it in 1983 . the story that i remember is much worse than last year . it does not say much about the new millennium or anything else that has been told so far .|0
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome! Check it out and you'll be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. Both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. The music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict.|1
this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema . the film was originally set for two people , one for each person , as a way to make the film look like a movie . while there are some great comedies in the world , they are limited by the length and scope of the story . it is very easy for a man to have an affair with a beautiful woman , but i could n't see why she would even think such a ridiculous thing , when she has just told her whole family about him .|0
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of Jerry O' Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. Anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie.|1
Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still, even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense.Water has become incredibly rare substance?Well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voilà, water.Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after.|1
as a genghis khan ` ` fan ' ' i was looking forward to this movie . after devouring conn igguldens epic , which i just watched on dvd , i decided that i would watch the movie for an hour or so while i was waiting for my wife to get home from the movie and have sex with her son . i hate movies like this one and i have no idea what to make of them , other than the fact that they keep me up half of the night telling them how lame they were in bed .|0
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all of that... This film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential.|1
I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't.|1
i ' m a huge zack allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie . it was definitely not what i had been hoping for ! i was also disappointed that they didn ' t portray a lot of this film in any other genre . you would think people would have known better by now , because there is a whole series of similar movies made here . i know that the plot and characters were different in the first ten minutes of the movie . it was pretty boring , so i expected to feel a little disappointment at how things went , instead i felt nothing but joy .|0
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter.|1
Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. He, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., How sweet. Lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time, he is partnered with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty.|1
sometimes it ' s hard to be a pirate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun ! i ' ll admit it was a bit of an experience to watch and not really see what happened . . . the whole time you watched me , i just wanted to die . that ' s probably the reason why i made the film so bad . some people like to keep their heads down . well this is no different . . .|0
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.While I speak German as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience... So therefore, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are only done by 4 voices!|1
i own a copy of this film and have always loved it . i comment here , however , because i was just reading the second edition of this movie when someone told me how many people there were in the audience . i did not read that part of the book before i finished reading it - i just know it is an enormous tragedy to watch people suffering from depression . one of the big differences between these two movies is both comedies had been based on each other and the same plot . they are both great comedy stories , so i 'm surprised they have made it this long .|0
I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease.|1
i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was . once in a while you see it as a comedy or something of the sort , but no one else looks at it that way . the only person who actually takes the movie seriously is don ' t expect to be able to stand up for himself , so he simply chooses to stay on stage and act out the part of an actor - even if he is doing what he truly believes he should be doing . the problem is that don ' t quite follow the whole premise .|0
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes.|1
Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet.|1
i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self - immolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints , one of the first film studios to come on tv and do this . the story started with a little girl who saw her father at the movie theatre in downtown detroit . he was there with his wife and kids when the police arrived . the child 's mother was trying to help him and he did n't seem to know what happened . however , it turned out that she had been crying . she said she had fallen down the stairs and broken her ankle .|0
Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean, gripping, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years.|1
my son adam ( 5 years old ) is a big scooby doo fan . he like this film a lot and has been on television all his life and when we came along he had to ' just ' watch it because the first time he ever seen it he thought he was dead . i liked this movie , but i really did n't expect to see it every day for the next ten years . what a joke ! it was so bad that i had to watch it twice before i decided to watch it again as a child .|0
The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful.|1
"When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, I was breathless. I don't know how many times I went back to see that movies hoping to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (She became one), but she was so hot! I went to see ""Sweet Dreams"" when it came out because, by that time, Ms. Lange had become a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And she's always exciting to see.I never walked out of a movie faster."|1
this is a very low budget film , set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of high - tech equipment . there is no way to know for sure if we will see our friends again and if that happens we need to find somewhere else to get away from this place . you may not believe this , but i am really having trouble staying on camera at all . my first instinct is to make myself look like i am filming this , but i realize it would be bad for the show .|0
I have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly). The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember having seen it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been released on DVD or VHS although I shall browse around for a copy.The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young, mute Irish wife.|1
i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick . instead they go around and recreate the most horrific scenes in history . what do you know ? it was a terrible film , and i hate to be one of those people that thinks movies should be built on the ground rather than in the air . this was definitely not one of those movies i watched during my first few years of being in the movie world . for the past two years , i have looked forward to watching every damn movie ever made , and i did n't even feel the need to sit through any of the bad crap .|0
i ' m a fan of the horror movie , regardless of which hemisphere it comes from . i know what you mean . this movie is pretty boring . there are two characters in the film and they all seem to think that the only thing that will happen between them is for them to stop talking at the end of the movie so they can talk to each other . when the movie starts i feel as though i have to watch it again but i am too scared to try and force myself to do anything with it .|0
Love the TPB's but this was a lame episode. Didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has. Looked like it was put together in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was awful. The cast appeared like they knew this was a money-grab of an episode to get to market quickly. I hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me. The writing of this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show.|1
"I wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. Frankie Muniz of ""Malcom in the Middle"" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways."|1
"As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still going to get ""classic"" x-files, Drive showed that the X-Files was going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive, with the news camera footage. It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events. I would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking, ""Am I on the right channel?"""|1
"So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; this is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now both of us had seen to the first two Scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we notice a picture of Ken Shamrock (""The World's Most Dangerous Man"") on the cover."|1
this is one of the most horrible ' scary ' movies i ' ve seen for awhile . i had to wonder what was so scary about this , as well as whether it meant anything at all . how many people have come out of their homes to watch this movie and still get some pleasure out of watching it ? this film is even worse than the other ' horror ' books i ' m reading . the first thing you ' ll notice about this movie is that it has no plot or any form of dialogue .|0
Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained.|1
i am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good . let me make it clear , i do not know a thing about the book - except for the fact that all the characters were acting badly . and if you ask me there were some bad actors in it . i saw one very good actor die before my eyes ; but he was really an innocent kid from a village who could not have ever lived long enough to come across this movie with its tragic ending . here is another of my favorite reviews : ' the first two weeks in the desert are hard to come by ' .|0
"Oh my God... where to begin? ""Chupacabra Terror"" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes ""Demon Slayer"" look like ""The Exorcist"". Special note: A Horror B-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a hot girl in this one. With that inexcusable mistake, I should begin with the complete bash.First of all, if you're going to make a Horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a ""cool"" monster outfit."|1
some sort of accolades must be given to ` hellraiser : bloodline ' . it ' s actually out full - mooned full - blown , and you can ' t believe how bad this movie was . i have to say though , the story is n't very bad . i just wish that i had been a better actor . however , if you want to keep reading , look at the main character , george w. bush . do you think the book would be worth watching ? well , let me tell you , it is nothing short of a masterpiece . i am really trying to stay awake .|0
there was no need for this movie , plain and simple . the original , although hated by some , is not a good film , at least not as it has to be in my opinion . it is not something i thought that i would enjoy doing . it is just another one of my ' favorite ' movies . it has been a long year , and i have yet to hear of anything more exciting or interesting than this movie . when the time comes to make the movie , i am prepared . if you do not know what happened , do not read this .|0
i love his martial arts style , it is quick , close up and oh so fast , but it is totally unsatisfying . in fact , i was afraid that this game was boring as well . if anyone should be interested in the action , they should try to put a name to the scene of the murder . no one really wants to hear about the murder at all . it seems like the only way to get revenge is to make sure that people pay for their crime or die for it . the police do n't even give a damn what the killer does .|0
this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust . if it were n ' t for the needless animal killing in the movie i 'm sure we would n't ever have had to come up with all that . at first i thought it was going to be some sort of a comedy or something similar , but there were lots of laughs . it just seemed to lead to an ugly ending . after watching about 20 minutes of it , one of the main characters finally loses his wits and begins to try to kill them . then he gets eaten alive by a large bear .|0
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round Lake Tommahawk I for one would not mind living there!All in all a great film to watch over and over again.|1
having endured this film last night , i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for being honest . after all , i really have to do this more often , or else it 'll become an issue in my career . so far i had seen enough horror flicks and watched too many westerns to understand how they were used . i am not very good at judging people ' actions by how they behave . as i have said previously , most films are predictable and predictable ; that is , there is never any action .|0
"8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had basically ""phoned-in"" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.But upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.With the exception of Spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot ""longer in tooth"" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v."|1
I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations.|1
"It's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: ""Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget."""|1
Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking at you! Sony's got the rights to Harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! Anyhow, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully underknown, full of great stories, greater music, and it could have been 3 hours longer and I'd have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, where it played to a packed house. They were turning people away at the door!|1
i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time on the street . not to mention it made me want to get out and have some fun , if only to make myself feel better ! i felt like a total moron when i watched the movie because it showed such terrible characters , so bad that it could never be re - made or re - acted . i am just trying to figure out how i got mixed up with people who are actually good actors and who are really good at their jobs , even while doing things that are illegal .|0
Yep, it's me again! Mr 'I sit through crap so you don't have to'.What do you think this is about? Could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant DA to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to?|1
"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive."|1
Very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. It is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. The first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something I've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it.|1
Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless.|1
this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it . but this movie was different . you see a kid being dragged off to a circus , the next thing you know the kids are walking in on an actor who has gone through his entire life doing stupid stuff . some things were so bad , i ca n't even describe them . the story was just too disgusting . my mother made the movie when she was eight years old . it was pretty awful . there were lots of funny comedies and horrible characters - which is how i found myself watching this film .|0
nothing more than a soccer knock - off of the mighty ducks , this film proved to be annoying in most aspects . even when it was made i never watched it . instead i just read the movie while eating lunch . my favorite thing is watching a video with some of my friends and we get to watch it together every night . for example , after watching this movie i realized that it was probably the most interesting movie i have ever seen or heard of . there were not a lot of scenes in the movie , but the plot was very good .|0
this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics , and is a must see for all psychotronic fans . i had an awesome song written by my wife . i am not ashamed to admit i have been a little shocked at the style and timing of the musical . it was the best book i ever read ! but i just ca n't help but feel that i have lost my way in the whole thing . i am very surprised to see that the author actually wrote this . it is such an awful film . i do n't know why the publisher would want me to get involved in this kind of nonsense .|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. It also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films.|1
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I've seen both of those as well as Chop Shop and like in many instances, I don't feel the comparison is warranted. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added.|1
a straight - forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence . rob bowman ' s direction is more in line with your work than anything else he has seen in this movie . it seems as though he was never expecting to write this book , but even after his second draft i can see why . these are not exactly what i would have described as a good movie , and i feel that i may have been prejudiced against some characters in this one . however , they were all very good actors , especially on my first night on the job .|0
"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12"" x 10"". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment."|1
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in GodHe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulations. Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. Just think about it.|1
first off, i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to IMDb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs.|1
Definition of documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and barely learned a thing about them.The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anybody and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And is listening to people recite TMBG lyrics like they were supposed to be funny/interesting? It was neither.|1
"the book is great . it ' s one of my favorite books ever . the film , on the other hand , is actually very boring , and i was really looking forward to being done . however , after a couple hours in there , i could n't wait any longer so i got bored with the movie and started reading the diary again . i had to turn it over to see the title . "" why do we keep trying to figure out what happened to our mother ? "" does this make any sense ? how can it possibly make any sense ! ?"|0
"If you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. It did for me, at least. I'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the ""underwater shots"" of the ""fish"" ""swimming"". The sound which accompanies those shots is great too.One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as ""The Greatest American Hero"" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since."|1
this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs who are killing and killing people . the movies were never good but i was not so naïve as to believe they had something special . the main reason we saw them was because my dad , my sister and i thought they were hilarious . one night i heard a scream and went to check on it . it did n't sound too bad . there was an awful lot of crying and screaming in the movie . the only positive thing about that scene was that some of the acting was kind of easy .|0
lil pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp . the animation and voice acting were so terrible , it became the main attraction for the film . there is a lot about this character that i find difficult to handle : his name is william carmody and he is a nice - looking kid who has a very bright personality . if you like young children , just keep an eye out for them . do not tell anyone else . all of my friends on the team have written their own stories about him or his movie .|0
Unfortunately a boring flick, and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is. The leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant, charming and sexy, forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with. The dame herself merely walks through the flick, being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute.|1
"I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, ""Ben Johnson?!"" - he was a goddam MOVIE STAR guys, a COWBOY, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for TV disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. So there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm."|1
"Televised in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the ""greats"" of the American Musical form listen to this."|1
the quick and the undead is , finally , the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void . you may not like it , but that is the truth . one of the other characters in this collection is an ex - marine pilot from some sort of base in mexico . he goes on vacation to mexico to try and make things up as they go . while he did do it , he also attempted to get away with his life , leaving himself open to being hurt by a stranger . he was kidnapped by terrorists who wanted to kill him or take him to another location .|0
Predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page.|1
"i was unsure what to expect from ` ` driving lessons ' ' - unsure whether rupert grint could carry such a load , but not knowing for certain what the "" lesson "" would be . this is how it got started in 1967 . well , at least that 's one way of describing things . when you make an american film , you know you are about to get a whole lot worse than you expected . i had just gotten my first movie published in 1976 and i was hoping i would n't have to do any acting since i had no interest in anything like that ."|0
One of the worst films I have ever seen! After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! This movie isn't scary at all! There is even no Typical horror clichés,too. The plot and acting of This movie was terrible.|1
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.Bogart is always good.|1
"After being off the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s. ""Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health"" used the then (and I guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, George Hamilton (in a nice bit of casting)."|1
"One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings, and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse).The story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. It may be a little below ""Seabiscuit"", but not a lot."|1
"over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it ' s not without trying . you ' re getting your first full time job for the first time with a couple of young actors who got into a bit of trouble with the agency . in an attempt to keep everyone else on track , the production company tried to get rid of them . that ' s how the film ended up here . the main point is : "" we do not need to work our way down the list of people that are stupid enough to walk away with their money from the company ."|0
when naive young eddie hatch , a window dresser at savory ' s department store , falls for a statue of mary on the corner . but he also has to watch one of his best friends fall in love again ; this movie is nothing more than a sidebar to the real thing . it is one of those films that does n't even feel like a movie and are just part of a bigger joke . there are no happy endings or scary scenes between the plot and characters . i do not expect this film to make you happy , but it is certainly going to make me sad .|0
of course i am going to think it was a great movie . i recognized several people i did n ' t know , and i saw some pretty cool scenes . this one is amazing . the main character is an old man sitting by himself in a booth . he wears a long cape that is so old it seems as if it has only been worn for about 10 minutes . there is no sign of him or anyone else . the actors are all very cute , and the acting is fairly good . it sounds weird , and i just do not understand any of what they are saying .|0
"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory."|1
why is it that every time i mention this movie to somebody , i have to hear 10 minutes of their opinion ? am i in trouble for thinking about these movies ? what happens if they go on about me and my career choice ? no . well , ok , maybe a few others , but the rest do n't even make much sense ! anyway , all i can say at this point is that sometimes it is better not to know what you 're looking for . i want to avoid talking about the film because there is something else to worry about .|0
not the best of the wip ' s , but not the worst either . i honestly feel guilty laughing at a comedy that did not get done in the end . you know , if only i had seen these before ! i would have gotten to see this one after all . it was very good . there are so many places to kill a bad movie . and i do mean bad - bad movies . they are so ugly that you could look into them and not see what you were looking for . oh , my god . i should have written this down in a journal or something .|0
The Toxic Avenger... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror... I even have read of a cult following with this series.... Now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that I couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think was to be the horror part of this movie...drug dealing, sumo, Godzilla entrance....|1
"The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability ""to take fragments and make them whole"" affects everyone within her sphere."|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. If you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. Its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.Also I was wondering, where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, It went pretty good.|1
nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again . from the first image , it was so much easier to film than to watch it . if you would prefer a movie about men and women trying to create an artificial relationship with each other , it is not my forte . i liked to have people around who thought it was cool to be in a show . even if they just acted out of jealousy ( or because they wanted to make fun of the actors ) , as i have seen some of them do , it does not go very far .|0
so well done . the photography , sound , music and the performances were the best . it ' s also a beautiful film which has been filmed in this studio for about four years . i have never seen any of the movies ; i always assumed it was just as great . however , i was wrong . one night when we were all sitting down for an early sunday afternoon movie , we were told not to watch the whole film . after a quick glance at the bottom of the screen to see what is going to come from the action , i decided to give it another go .|0
what a cast . . . and what a waste of it . seriously , when a movie has gabriel byrne , it is as if this movie has all the good - looking quality actors and actors in it that it has at its finest . i mean , what is wrong with the film ? it is so damn boring . not to mention bad . the only thing that really helps is the fact that you will get to spend a lot more time watching the movies in person than you are getting to watch in your real life .|0
"The back of the DVD for this movie raves, ""Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films."" This isn't so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. Flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility."|1
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. The direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.Spy Vs Spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.Even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.I got half way through and switched off - completely bored.|1
This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part).|1
"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just a look at his new film, ""Everything is Illuminated"", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector."|1
"Better than average World War II-era ""who-dun-it"" featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. The link to ""courage"" is not particularly clear.This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels murder."|1
i say ben johnson and my fellow canadians say , ` ` ben johnson ? ! ' ' - he was a guy from canada . why do you think he stayed in canada ? well , the answer to this is because he went to montreal for a few days with his mom , who apparently does not have any children . he never saw us , either , which is a shame , because it meant a lot to him that we had kids . and then there 's our little cousin david , who did not even want to be a hockey player when he grew up .|0
seriously , sci - fi needs to stop making movies . they ' re all horrible . and this one had john rhys - davies film that i ' ve always found the most boring . it has been on tv since the 1970s , with some pretty lame acting and a lot of dialogue . but then again , what can you expect ? it ' s hard to tell if you ' re filming in real life . not that any of those people would even know what a movie should look like at this point . as i mentioned previously , the movie is very old fashioned and extremely stupid .|0
a suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production . features performances from no - name actors that rival the top five star movies i have ever seen . this film is not going to make any difference , though . i can see how it would be hard for a film writer to get a decent job on his own , but i can assure you that he will succeed at whatever he tries . i will tell you this because i had been watching some of this before . when the first film was released , the director called my agent and said he could n't do anything about it .|0
i love pop culture , but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this . then , i found it pretty interesting , and it did n't hurt that we all like pop culture . i really enjoyed the book , as much as my editor did . i also spent an hour on the computer to go over some of what my editor had said . i guess i just never got to look at it without thinking about him or her . i 'm sure it 's nothing to be embarrassed about . i still ca n't believe that they would do this .|0
"What I got was something better.Just like many movies I've commented on as of recently, I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, ""Blue Spring"" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. I loved the trailer for ""9 Souls"", and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why.This movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else."|1
"ah , another movie with motorcycles , hell ' s angels posse and steve a - lame - o as the not - so - cool car driver . you will never hear from me again ! what is wrong with you two kids ? this movie was about a boy whose parents were killed in a terrible car wreck and how he found his mother in her bed . i really do not want to hear anymore about this movie ; it 's just too awful . "" if i could get out of this , i would ! i am sorry that i have to see this movie , but please leave my son alone ."|0
tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter do not come from money . in fact , after all this work , it does not pay any attention to how beautiful and strong women are , or how attractive they look . a great thing about this movie is that i get to spend as much time watching other people interact with their friends and loved ones as i want to watch the best part . there are lots of wonderful scenes where the two of them can have a great time together while they make up lies and plot holes .|0
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of Director Jack Swanstrom. Clearly, Swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.This thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. As with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie.|1
this movie was astonishing how good it was ! the plot is extraordinary , and the acting spectacular . at times i thought there were some flaws in the plot which would cause the camera to fall out of the sky a bit , but it was pretty easy to fix that . i really could have used this film on my first trip around the country . i saw a lot of dead soldiers during the war . they were almost as tough as your average soldier . you will never understand what happens to a guy when he goes off the road .|0
WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through.|1
what a trip down memory lane . do not look for great acting , believable plot lines , or anything resembling a good scene . there is something in this movie that gets you to want to be a fan . if it looks bad , you should run like hell . if it looks good , try to stay alive and get the hell back on the track . it is an extremely crappy film , but the actors are always so well - laid . this movie has been doing some of the greatest hits in the book since i have read it .|0
"Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, ""Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian"" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. Not well done."|1
"I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another ""Biblical"" film again, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. Hello? EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to scripture."|1
this film did not excite me . while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the time . they were so good , even the director said so , but after a few months , i realized that their show was made up of little kids with no imaginations . when i returned to the tent , i saw that the film ' s audience was more impressed than i had ever been in my life . i was really disappointed that the movie should be filmed in such a way , but i did see some interesting parts .|0
"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $30,000."|1
"A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character ""Alice"" played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library."|1
i found it hard to care about these characters , who were either annoying or insipid , all living their lives as if nothing at all were happening . in my opinion this story should be a horror story of the sort which you will expect to see in a horror novel . however , after reading the first two movies , i was just beginning to come to terms with the fact that i have been told to watch an entire movie . they are so much worse than those comedy shows . most of them are very stupid and often make no sense .|0
three distinct and distant individuals ' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . the one - hour film , which is based on no more than a series of videos , consists of only four minutes of audio recording , about half of which is very little more than a series of photographs . the other half is much less than that . i have to say the movie was a pretty crappy one . it did nothing but scare the crap out of everybody . not exactly what i would have called my first experience with a movie .|0
two years after ' airplane ! ' took off , jim abrahams , jerry and david zucker cast one of its most famous acts on the stage . it was not what he had envisioned when he saw it with his camera but he knew that this film would be well worth seeing . the following scene was a bit of a letdown . there are several scenes where the director makes up a play to get attention , and then they make an act out of nothing . none of these actors are very creative , so the director has to do whatever it takes to get the acting job done .|0
"(The beginning might be a spoiler...)""The Eye 2"" is the sequel to ""The Eye"". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. ""The Eye"" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas ""The Eye 2"" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit watching this."|1
"What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting, believable plot lines, or anything resembling a quality movie.This is pure blaxploitation at it's finest. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialog, objectification of women, and the sleaziest cops you can imagine.This vanity piece by the ""Godfather of Rap,"" Rudy Ray Moore, who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured.You not only see blaxploitation at it's finest, but get glimpses of his comedy genius, and see why his records were kept under the counter."|1
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
Get the CD instead. The show is tame, and the editing sucks. The crowd gets way too much screen time, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape it's recorded on.|1
warning : i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment . when i first started seeing the movie it was n't bad ; i just saw one of those old movies , in which there 's a lot more to it . but then we discovered that there is no sequel . so my friend and i were amazed to discover that this was a really good thing . it also brought on a new level of fascination at the beginning of the story . the author made a big point of trying to educate the characters as well as giving them a fair chance at making a difference .|0
I saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it.Look, I can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. But this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. Oh well, they say love is blind...The neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too.|1
this gem captures early 80 ' s life brilliantly . as a grad ' 83 boymyself , i must say that valley was not the most picturesque city in america . however , the scenery was lovely . there are lots of spectacular views but i could see right away it would have been much too good to live in . at the time , my only concern was how i could make up for the poor conditions . i do not know what made me consider such a drastic change in location ; it all seems like a great waste of money . if you want something bad enough , they can have it .|0
"i would just like to point out ( in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd ) that this one is really boring ! no , it has to be a very good film . i mean , look at the characters ! i am not saying there is any good quality of comedy , but there are all kinds of great plot twists and wonderful plot twists . if you get bored , you can always stop and watch this movie . well , maybe i do n't have to sit through it because i know what "" bad actors "" look like and what "" bad acting "" looks like ."|0
Firstly, I am a huge fan of crap films. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is just plain bad. I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning, it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot.|1
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on the eastern front. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wishing for the next. Pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialog. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time.|1
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair).|1
i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds ( probably left over from the day before ) , were being dragged out through the tunnel by a group of drunken guys who made a lot more noise than is absolutely necessary in the movies . it was n't much better than the movie . but at least the action was predictable . the actors are too drunk to be bothered . there are quite a few characters that have no knowledge of the real story , and even less knowledge about their own character 's character .|0
nothing about this movie is any good . it ' s a formulaic predictable ` ` romantic comedy ' ' geared to make the viewer feel special ' but it ' s more than that . in this movie , the plot thickens by an act of sabotage . we have never seen anything like this in our entire lives , and it makes me cringe just thinking about it . i can ' t believe there is someone who could pull off such an outrageous stunt . i know that this movie is no exception . the plot is absolutely unbelievable . my parents were quite happy when they heard the movie had appeared .|0
this was such a great film . it was done with such beautiful design , such symmetry . i love the movies , of course . i could not enjoy one without watching it more than once or twice . this movie is so bad that i would give my soul to buy it again . but if you can believe it , here we are in america and i am just being a fan . the first two hours are pretty boring . most of the acting was very interesting and it did n't have all the same characters . the movie is really horrible , and i thought it would never end .|0
such pain ! pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea , but it never fully worked . i am one of two people that are able to make this story come alive . first of all , a book like this can not be written . for instance , i have always considered the premise of a novel as a movie , based on an episode where someone makes up a bunch of stuff and then tells it to his friend . however , there is more to the story than meets the eye . the plot is completely out of character , just like the movie was when it first began .|0
"i ' ve always enjoyed frank sinatra ' s music , and just recently i wrote a term paper about his life . i ' ll give it to someone who can ' t see what ' s going on , he would have a very good opinion . but this was something completely different . the idea of frank sinatra ' s songs being performed for all those people makes me want to kill myself . it ' s terrible ! how can such a stupid , unpopular movie be considered as "" terrible "" ? even worse , it ' s not funny !"|0
and there are not many in cinema history . ` ` rouge ' ' seems to be a bit of a hope for us , but when you see one movie that is based on the same premise then it becomes even more difficult to understand why this movie has been made . at the same time , people always want to see it again and again . some people want to see another movie because they feel like they have no choice as to what happened , others just want to make it into a reality show about them .|0
being a big fan of stanley kubrick ' s clockwork orange there was of course ` ` no question about it ' ' yes ' but that wasn ' t the point . the point was : i could have made a lot of progress if i had a camera . instead i took one out of its case and checked it from every angle in order to see exactly what i would be looking for . the first couple times i tried , i was disappointed with the results . then i realized they were not all that different from anything else i had been doing for many years .|0
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002."|1
the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad , although it is . the odd thing about galaxina is that it makes us look like fools . it looks at people who do not live long enough to actually have a good life . it is also a great movie and in many cases an excellent one . if it was really bad , it had more action than they ever imagined . i just ca n't tell you how happy my family and i got as a group of friends from home for this story . we are so proud of these movies .|0
a very good film , focusing on a very important issue . fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect , especially in the first five or six years . that is not to say the author of this novel does not try to keep up with his writing , but he seems to forget that this story is not about any kind of social event . the story is simply about an average kid having a rough time of it because he does n't make friends and wants to know what really happened when he decided to commit suicide - as a matter of fact .|0
"This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by ""Friday the 13th"". ""The Prey"" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.But ""The Prey"" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason."|1
"there ' s lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel , which i ' m sure you already know . "" her father looked at her with one eyebrow raised to make sure she knew he was kidding . "" how do you know ? "" he asked , looking like he didn ' t believe her . and even though she didn ' t like him personally , he still respected her abilities to read people and could probably read the real story without having to really put much thought into it . she just couldn ' t tell him what she knew ."|0
i ' ve seen the beginning of the muppet movie , but just the half . because i only watched it a couple of times , i have no idea how that is even possible . this is all so surreal ; it ' s unbelievable . i mean , what am i doing on an island ? maybe you ' re going to find out in a couple of days . well i ' ve seen more than one horror flick like that before and i would really like to get back to my own time as soon as possible .|0
"I won't spoil it for you. Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what I mean after you watch it) Poor story. B-rated movie quality. Typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. I should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add ""quotes"". Just tells me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. I wish I could take back the time I spent watching this."|1
"I caught this movie late night on TV, and was expecting a low-budget campy ""masterpiece"", I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.There is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a ""big brother""-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix."|1
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him.|1
Hey guys and girls! Don't ever rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the Oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc.|1
"""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie."|1
` ` out to sea ' ' is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau . they are very well known . there are lots of famous actors , actresses , and people i have only heard about in the last four years . some of them act as if they have lost their virginity . for those of you who have read this book , it might seem that such an unlikeable characters would be better described as bad - looking or unattractive , especially when viewed through a lens of good humor and humor .|0
"This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust. If it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' (""Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films"") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - I'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. But as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. To sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal."|1
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO. It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater, providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers.|1
What can I say about a movie as bad as this? The people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in.|1
brett piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film ` ` experts . ' ' expert ' does not fit into the movie . no one knows why this was done . there must have been people on the inside who believed it could get better . well , i 'm going to show you how much of a wuss these ' experts ' are and what they expect from us in the real world . if you think i want to pay to see this movie , just go ahead . please do n't say anything to anyone else .|0
I normally don't like romantic films, but I love this film very much. The story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel I really care for many characters in this film. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott until the ending scene. I want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the ending.|1
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever the heck she is. Chauvelin would not randomly shoot Tony in the head.|1
there are rumours that a fourth underworld is going to happen . if so , than the third part , which was actually supposed to be a trilogy , was completely unnecessary . and now you know what i mean . this book is no different from the rest of the books i have ever written or seen in my whole life . the only difference being that i had one plot with the main character as the protagonist , and this was very similar . well , minus the fact that it was some sort of an epic fail - safe on purpose .|0
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew that I had to see this movie, even though I can't say I'm a soccer fan. But watching this just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it.Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it.|1
i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life . it really makes me sad to watch . you know what i mean when i say that this was a very bad movie at the start of the season . it had an excellent plot , but it was nothing like this . for the first half hour , the acting was fairly good . the characters were charming , funny and interesting , but overall the plot was mediocre . i hate to admit , but the ending was pretty pathetic . there are so many scenes and some of them are awful .|0
"Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the ""hilarious"" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage."|1
"stephanie meyer is going to be so ticked ! now , her book ` ` breaking dawn ' ' will not be as good as it was a few years ago . . . she has to make one of her jokes . this is the first time she has actually made a film that makes me think she is having an affair . what does it take for her to keep her cool and not get into some serious trouble ? did she ever tell anyone else how she came up with "" broken dawn ' in the first place ?"|0
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that didn't really show. There wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive.|1
"wow . . . just . . . wow . there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to check and see if there was something else that would be different from what i am seeing in this movie . let 's see how it turned out , ok ?

"this is a fantastic film . the acting is some of the best i ' ve seen . tatyana samojlova is really beautiful and very intelligent . i ' ve just finished reading an article in the daily news which says that this film was conceived in 1914 . it is called "" what can you do ? "" it looks like it would be more accurate to describe the film than for me to actually write it . the story is pretty good but the characters , as well as the character , are much more complicated than anything we could ever have come up with ."|0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen . the story line is a joke , the effects are bad . it sounds like you could just go back to your normal self , if you do that . and as for the plot ... well , here 's the funniest scene ever made . in all the films i have seen , at least 1 or 2 lines of dialogue were not actually directed by a person who was acting , but the characters themselves were very realistic . there is something so comical about someone trying to tell you how to live your life without being killed .|0
I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it.|1
there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of events . in any case , we are all going to get used to it . at least , for me . i never had a chance to do what my mother and sister did tonight . by the end of the movie i realized how awful this whole thing must have become . if you 're going to be a reporter you need to stay focused on the job . this movie is bad and has nothing to do with the real world as i understand it .|0
"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER."|1
"This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome.Any movie that preaches about the ""one true god"" gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism."|1
The plot for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the Phillipines. One Black, and one White. These two women, are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the Phillipines and assume a better life.|1
distributor : goodtimes home video plot : a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense movie , although she has the appearance of being very good . however , she does not know how to do it . there are a lot of elements to the movie , but i am sure that will change if you watch these films from the viewpoint of someone else . they show the girl who was kidnapped by the black - clad demon and then finds her alive and unharmed at an amusement park where she had been abducted .|0
"Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a film with these two together for the first time! Now imagine THE WORST film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to ""Night Vision"". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction."|1
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and Jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.But she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions.|1
"I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled ""Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op."|1
mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary . in the world of wine there is a huge different between the stories that describe it . however , one of the very best things about this movie is its plot . i loved it as much as you do because it was an amazing story that took place in the past . what makes it memorable is the sequel to the last movie i ever saw . it was the first one i ever saw but for some reason i have never seen it before . it seemed so long ago that i was only a kid back then .|0
Most awful casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack head, a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on.............Stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the streets. It's a joke!The only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that I finished watching it. I just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end.Trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie. Trying to be freaky. So stupid!|1
Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months.|1
"this is n ' t a bad tv movie . shtrafbat is short for shtrafnoy batallion , which means penal batallion . i never heard of that , but it is interesting to watch the whole show with the exception of the parts where he has to talk about things that are not important - such as how he "" d rather have sex with other girls in his apartment than just be a friend of a girl he "" s been friends with all his life , and how he didn "" t want to let her go so he could find out when they went out ."|0

And obviously I didn't see it! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.Did Jason Gedrick really decline this?|1

****Contains Spoilers****As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character.|1
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch. Too unreal. It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. Who couldn't do that? The cheating was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards?|1
"Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.This film is about a young boy, Alejandro ""Ale"" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar ""Izzie"" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (that I did not even know existed--Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops."|1
well , it took them 4 tries , but they finally got it right ! in this 4th sequel to this horror movie i thought you guys would be so easy to read . it was like we could learn from the very beginning that a good story can just not always be as good as the bad and that if it is good enough it does not have any redeeming qualities . it did not take long for me to think i was being unfair by portraying this terrible movie as a tragedy , but i decided to watch the video anyway . i had no other choice .|0
definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over - think their movies . lots of people from around the world get hooked on movies , but i see nothing wrong with making a few extra credits out of this one because i have never watched anything like it . it was really good , and even better than my first film , which was called ' love at first sight ' . i saw no real reason why anyone would want to come back to this part of the world after spending three years living in this place .|0

Let's get one thing straight: I like much of Snipes' work. Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. This film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either. In fact, if I never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! It's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film.|1
Not a balanced point of view. The director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. The movie has some criticism of Fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. But that is not the case.The movie barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the MRTA insurgents that took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning.|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe I have ever seen.Completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - The entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movieMany people left halfway - Can't blame them... I stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and I wish I'd left.|1
the trouble with this sort of lyrical film - making is that you either make a masterpiece , or a lemon : i could n't decide which category was worse . there is no better actor than harry potter . they make these movies because they like to talk about themselves and have a great show . in the beginning it was just too horrible , but after my first experience of watching a movie on television , i decided it was nothing more than a waste of time , a waste of money . the real question is why did i watch the movie ? oh , yeah .|0

All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil.|1
"i remember watching police squad ! when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a big - budget action movie , at the time i was actually disappointed . but now i can appreciate how hard it is to get good tv shows . my favorite thing about this movie is that it did nothing to help me feel better about the way things were going to end . as far as the "" bad guys "" went , i do not know who won the race or if the outcome would have been different , but it was horrible ."|0
"""Rouge"" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. It isn't a sequel of any sort. The very end, which I won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. This film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story."|1
although this has to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode is n ' t badly written or acted . you may wish that i had taken more liberties in editing this movie , and that it would not be so difficult to write a story about these people who are such a bad influence on this film . but sadly , this film was made for someone who really wanted some real action , even though there was nothing at all interesting about the scene . i can remember being disappointed when one of the actors got shot out of order , but this movie was very good .|0
this movie is dated in so many ways , it ' s sensational . you can either laugh at it or hate it . on the plus side , with such a small audience , i was able to keep some things under control , and had some real fun . but i ' m starting to get sick of watching these stupid movies , even when i did n't actually watch them . i ' ve been trying to work out a way for myself to make something of myself , but i didn ' t get that far . it ' s not just what i saw during the movie as well .|0
"...out of this movie.Sorry to say, this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the Festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. ""Not so..."" I was told. ""the director wants it this way"". Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialog is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words."|1
"It starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they transfered to Capitalistic country, here it is, Czech unofficial but well known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making ""art"" and ""politics"" and ""horror"" and ""humor"" and ""film"" and money."|1
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great I forgive him.Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done.|1
like the above poster , i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other piranha . . . this movie is horrible . . . and the main characters are great but they are just terrible . so much bad sci - fi crap from this movie that you can watch it as well . why do n't you read it ? it makes me feel like an idiot when i have to watch this one . i mean , at first i was interested , but then i saw how people acted and how they behaved and i could n't take my eyes away . .|0
i ' m not really sure where to begin . from start to finish , bad , stinky bad , like the kind of shit that gets on a plane or something . . . i can relate to this . anyway , once we go through it , it gets boring . then it becomes fun . there are times when i feel like all i want to do is scream and punch my way out of this place . but no one listens to me . they keep their distance . i try to be friends with some of the guys at school and get along with most of them .|0
Would be promising if it were a student film. Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.|1
Not good. Mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. Some comments : 1. I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything Henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3.|1
Wow... I suspected this one to be bad... But now I find myself just at a loss for words... Honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...I'll try to say something anyway...This truly is one unique gem. One of the worst kind.Lash La Rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a Toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt.It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone.|1
mind you , it ' s not supposed to be , but it is . as a wee tot , i have never thought too much about what makes people think that they can go out and do whatever they want with their life without any expectations . i only know that we are not meant to be in this world , although there are times when i really wanted to get out of the house and into my own body . i didn ' t like seeing myself sitting at home while everyone else went out on their first mission .|0
this is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts . donald ' s dream was just another one to make up for his failure as a writer when it came time to write the sequel . he should have seen this movie through the eyes of others . the plot was good , but you could never see anything remotely like this coming from someone who has spent his entire career in a book club ( with all the special effects that you can think of because there was no real point to the script ) .|0
new guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow marines . if you want to see more of the films , visit my website : http : // robertrobertrobertrobertrobertrobert.blogspot.com and watch this film for a few minutes ! it 's really not that bad , i just ca n't get into all of the movie scenes . i only have one story to keep me company at night , although it is usually a nice thing to do to have some time to talk with someone else . after viewing a movie with such a good ending , i was surprised how much fun the story was .|0
i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up . i was greeted by a series of odd characters , which made no sense to me at all . in fact the plot was pretty much the same . they were simply not related . what i really appreciated most was the movie itself . there were two distinct reasons for this film . first off , it did not go well with the original idea of the plot . the main reason is because the plot was wrong . that does not make anything better than being a character who lives like a complete jerk .|0
ok , so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid . however , i think there should be a little better art to this than the movies . you can see for yourself that it was one of the greatest horror movies in history . most of the characters and dialogue are just as bad as they make themselves out to be , but they were very well executed . do n't get me wrong , they did a great job with the acting and the acting , but the premise was not quite as much fun as it used to be .|0
many believe this movie is a baseball movie . such people are disappointed because it ' s about a baseball player who goes out for a late night jog on a hot summer night and falls asleep at the base of his hill . if you see them coming out of their house or going to the shower , go back to watching the television instead . i just hope they don ' t miss me too badly in the first ten minutes . there really is no reason to believe that this movie is actually based on anything but the original . the whole story is just so ridiculous !|0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail.|1
rowan atkinson ' s mr . bean ranks right up there with laurel & hardy , buster keaton , the marx brothers , bruce willis and the other people of the genre . as you might expect , this was not the worst movie that ever came out of the dark ages . actually , it is a little much for someone like me to judge . in fact , when i look through this film , i can not believe what i see on the screen . i just do n't have time to think of any other things to watch before i turn it off !|0
i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i ca n ' t understand why it would have a sequel . the plot was quite interesting - all the action , the actors , the lines , the dialogue , the acting . you know what they really wanted to do ? hang out with the characters and try to figure out what happened after that movie . there must be some mistake : the scenes are so clear and predictable , but as the story progresses , they become more complicated .|0
this is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie . remake a classic film shot - by - shot . i hope nobody gets hurt , because if you do , it would be worse than losing a half million credits . and the fact that this movie has n't even been created yet makes my blood run cold with fear . how could anyone get away with this kind of thing ? when i saw this first film i thought i was in love , but when i came back to the house it was obvious that i had misjudged the character again . this film is really bad .|0
i just finished watching this ( last weekend ) and found it absolutely hillarious , some of the scenes i 've seen have been a little too suspenseful . i find that if i watch enough times to get over it , they are never going to be good . these films are very bad . there are no words for them . there is nothing at all to explain how this movie goes . it just does not seem to fit right . everything is so boring and boring . why does anyone want to live in a cave ? this film makes you feel as if your whole head is on fire .|0
you know , i really hate imdb ' s censor system , since my entire review is almost gone if you look at it in that way . for the record , what i say is true ; this is not a movie , but a short version of a long story involving a character who was murdered and left alive . i can just imagine how disappointed these guys would be once they got out of their car to get a look at him . i have to confess , i do n't feel like doing any writing either . i want to help them , but i ca nt .|0
This is only the fourth effort I’ve watched from this director (whom I met and found quite genial at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – I’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone!|1
Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it.|1
OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. But when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched Ghost Lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. The story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop.|1
man with the screaming brain certainly is n ' t a perfect movie , but i ' m pretty sure it was never filmed . the main plot is fairly boring . the first scene was really good , but in the final scene , it was terrible . after the credits came rolling , i got a weird feeling that something was definitely wrong . there were too many times that i could have used this movie for inspiration to be a success . i don ' t think you can get more bad acting from the critics of this movie than from someone who has done nothing to deserve such an awful cast .|0
this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long . there was an aspect of film - noir contained in this film that he found disturbing , not only due to the unlikeable character but also because of the way the story turned out . i have yet to see a film that made any kind of sense at all , and here i stand looking at a movie that was about to turn into a horror show . you can be sure it will end up with me having to look over the shoulder of the actors as if they were making a scene .|0
i supposed ' scarecrow gone wild ' is a dull slasher flick . yes , it have some good point , but not too much . after an initial shock of horror , i am happy to find that there is little to be read on this one , and the rest are nothing more than a complete waste of his time . no sense in making him cry . he was probably just trying to make me feel better about the situation so i would do something constructive instead . what i found as i was writing this story , however , is that i had to pay attention to the details .|0
"""The next Karate Kid"" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and charming and I cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie."|1
in reunion island in the indian ocean , the owner of a cigarette factory louis mahe ( jean - paul belmondo ) has purchased a home for the first time in ten years . after spending several hours with him over the last year , this was one of the most enjoyable moments of my life and it feels as if every emotion i carry around here has been washed away to let me go . how many times have i stood on an airplane and watched the scenery pass by ? at this moment , i wish that i could just enjoy the day and not think about all the crap i 've already been through .|0
Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport.|1
"Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF actors.Boy was I wrong.The direction and story telling in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production.I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this ""film"" but have to say they were conned.If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed."|1
"I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background ""car sounds"" audio just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot."|1
i love this movie , first and foremost because of mark wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end result has a really good feel . you can get lost in this one without even trying . for example , who cares what the title of this movie was ? well , that 's not to say i did n't have a lot of fun reading the book . after all , i watched it for 10 minutes . but if you had watched the movie before , it probably would have been more of a bad joke . as a matter of fact , why were we watching this at all ?|0
oh , dear ! this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen . it ' s like a movie where every word is directed by an actor as if nothing has changed in the movie at all . why do these people think that this movie is bad , and how did they know about it anyways ? it ' s just a waste of time . after all , who cares about making movies or watching television when you can watch a million movies at once and still keep your eyes glued to the screen ?|0
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration. After a session at a recording studio Frank Sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was Jewish. He lectured them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer.Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for Columbia records. If You Are But A Dream and the song written for the film, The House I Live In.|1
This movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I am talking about. That kid's vicous! Although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity.|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, that's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people. They couldn't be further apart in ideas.Novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may/may not use him for sex.|1
i saw this movie on tv and loved it ! i am a real disaster film fan , and this show was the best ever . i would love to tell you about it , but i think you will be disappointed in me . for one thing , there is not even an ounce of enthusiasm about the movie . what really sucks is that at any point during the whole movie i thought i would find out some very interesting words or things . instead , all i could do was sit and watch . the acting was much better than anything i have ever seen in movies .|0
What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs.|1
what to say about ` ` dead end road ' ' . . . lets just say that edgar allen poe would have been a very good author . . . this is the first novel i am looking into , but i have found that some people prefer the genre where the plot and plots are not so complex . i also found that the story has an element of drama in it which i was not expecting . i will make a statement for the purposes of writing this : no one knows how much i enjoyed watching this movie , so why do n't they find something else to watch ?|0
"Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies (e.g. the English Patient), but have far less appeal.After the first half-hour I started checking my watch, wondering if I'd make it home in time to catch Leno on tv.I passed up ""Gladiator"" to see this!? !"|1
the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie , but they had to have seen the movie . it was really terrible and would have been so hard to put together . we got back home and watched the movie . it was basically just one scene with two scenes . the actress is a beautiful young woman , in her early twenties , and has lots of hair that looks very natural . i could not help but compare this movie to other films on the shelf . well , not quite an episode , but there is a lot of dialogue involved .|0
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to pick this DVD up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, I'll spend £10 and buy it. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing to say about it.|1
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint. I was reminded so often of other movies, it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself, is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.BUT...See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever.|1
the only pure life , is one that ends with a signature in blood . so says mishima anyway , a young girl that has spent many nights alone and never felt the love of someone . it was an amazing tragedy that happened on this very stage , but i do n't think any of us believed that would happen to her . if she ever found true love , she probably would have given up by now . then what did it mean ? what did it make me see ? why did my parents choose such a horrible ending for their daughter ?|0
"i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must ' ve come on and rated it as "" bad "" , which is actually pretty good . it has a few good lines , and i can understand why some folks like to look at this movie for inspiration , especially when they get to watch it themselves . it was quite an experience . it was the most entertaining movie i have ever seen , but the premise was so far out there , that i could not put my finger on what was wrong with it ."|0
"How offensive! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those at NBC saying, ""OK. Let's make a movie to appease those pesky Christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order."" Well, they were wrong. Anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0."|1
"ten years before ` ` the matrix ' ' and hot on the heals of ` ` they live ' ' came this brilliant new movie . "" i really did n't want to go into the details of the other stuff , but since it happened , i wanted to enjoy it all . besides , i thought it was better than a whole bunch of boring , non - memorable movies . anyway , i think the movie gave me hope that somehow some kind of film would prove that there were people who were actually capable of such horrible things ."|0
For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema.|1
First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like cliché'e version of gangsters.The movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters.|1
if you came here , it ' s because you ' ve already seen this film and were curious what others had experienced at least a few times . the fact that we ' ll have to watch this one again with two other people who weren ' t there makes me sick . i ' m sorry , everyone , but i ' ve got to get back . i ' m sorry about the rest of this movie . thanks for letting me spend it . now can you tell me what has been going on around here for the last three weeks or so ?|0
what can i say ? after having read herbert ' s books and loving lynch ' s movie version , i was shocked at how easy it was to understand the plot . now i really find this hard to comprehend . i saw a lot of movies where people were stuck in an awkward situation or situations where they only got one choice . if you want to know what happens next , just look into my computer . it ' s on dvd . but , for some reason there was a film that was worse than any i have watched .|0
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might).|1
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. Isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures?|1
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy's the man. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.|1
i am very open minded . i watch all kinds of programs to the end . . . good or bad . . . but i have never seen this film , as i was told by many others , and so i spent several hours reading about it and wondering what else could be on it , and then when the movie came on the screen , i was amazed to find that it was a comedy . after being in the middle of it for 20 minutes , i was starting to make a mental list of all those who would have enjoyed it .|0
"Dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and Todd is his Masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale- ""A Little Priest"" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy."|1
oh dear ! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this group , so let me make one of the worst films on television in the last five years ; i was a bit of a romantic when i first saw it , but as soon as it became available i began to think that it must be better . now with all the movies and tv shows that i have seen since then i just do n't know if it really matters anymore . i mean why waste time watching something that may or may not even be good until you want to see it ?|0
"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"""|1
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. And trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.|1
"What an utter disappointment. Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead. What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane? ALL the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for ""lowest common denominator"" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people."|1
definitely worth renting ! good clean family entertainment . my 4 and 5 year - olds ( and i ) loved it . well , almost all of the shows that followed had to be seen in person . they were really funny . i could n't wait until we got out of there so i can see them . but how do you get back from a trip to new york ? the first movie is bad , but what 's the big deal ? i will admit that i watched it many times and was quite impressed with the results .|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that?There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests."|1
this review contains spoilers . i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead with some good ones . i love to watch these and they are fun , even if they are not my favorite things . i enjoyed the first two movies more than i liked the first three . i also loved how it all worked because i had a lot of fun watching the movie as a teen . at least i thought i did . but now i have to look back in time and imagine what would have happened if we had stayed home .|0
Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops.|1
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig.|1
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.What then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups.|1
its long time that i and my wife didnt see such a boring thriller . its definitively not a gripping thriller with no plot - although there appears to be one where an actor gets into trouble with the producer , and then turns around to make sure it isn ' t going to happen , but instead just has this guy walk off and tell his girlfriend he ca ' t live without her . it is really pretty good , especially at the end when the villain becomes very frustrated and confronts his ex - girlfriend for some sort of revenge .|0
the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments ( much less hundreds of ' votes ' ) speaks for itself . in a very real sense it does . at times , you have the impression that you are actually making an enemy out of people who are not being good to you . this is because i am on the side of good people . they are so bad that they should be made to pay for crimes they commit . but they do n't . they just like to go around trying to make something better or even worse .|0
"if any movie ever made italians look bad , this is it . duke mitchell - what an a - - hole . "" "" i am impressed . i do n't know why i thought i would want to go out tonight . i have not been in italy for five years and i can say with absolute certainty that nothing good ever happens on the first date . i hate italian movies . they are just so boring and stupid . now here i am in london , surrounded by some idiotic characters who are trying to make a film that could be used for one of the movie theaters in paris ' history ."|0
"mr . bug goes to town was one of those films that i grew up hearing about , however a copy came out on dvd and i liked it at least as much as some of the actors . the movie went like this - "" 
 "" i think you 're trying to fool me into believing that you could see all the bad things in this movie . "" "" there 's really nothing in this movie worth seeing , "" he says dryly . "" just an example for the other characters : ' do n't get me wrong ; i love everything i have read , especially the parts where the plot thickens ."|0
with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie . well , it is a little funny actually , but i really thought it was great until i saw the title . it is based on the most terrible film i ever read in my entire life . the plot does not seem to have even a single ounce of logic about how we should go about this movie . there has to be a more believable outcome if we can solve this problem . and let 's tell you something , i do not feel like solving this problem , at least not right now .|0
i ' ve never written a comment on imdb before , but this movie was so bad it left me little to talk about . the plot is awful , like a nightmare and the characters are just plain boring . i can remember sitting at home with my kids watching tv for two hours straight ( or as much as they could watch it ) while listening to the noise from the tv . every once in a while i would look outside into the darkness of the woods and find that there were no deer to be seen . instead , i saw a large animal stalking through the woods toward me .|0
to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all . after all , this is the only time we are in real life . the first thing i would like to add to it is that if you look closely , you could see some of the stuff that is supposed to exist . so , just stay back . i am a great fan of comedy shows , but this is ridiculous . this is too much . how can i watch this crap without getting disgusted ? i really have no idea how to live with any of this !|0
"this can hardly be called a good movie , actually it ' s not even close . but i have to agree that the actors are pretty good . as long as their acting is very good , in the end it really doesn ' t matter because none of them will ever give you a second look again . at least one person on earth gets to make a movie that makes money . there is just no such thing as "" life is never easy "" or "" for sale ! "" in this case , if you think about your own life you will see that most everyone else ' s is better than that ."|0
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player.|1
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? The whole ""Complete Jane Austin"" series as a part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. Characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels rather rushed. The 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy though that ""Pride and Prejudice"" won't be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists."|1
it ' s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead , this has solid premise . i was n't expecting an open mind about this film , and for a while i simply wondered if it would make any difference . after all , it didn ' t matter how good it really was , because in the end everything is predictable . some people believe they can do anything on television , but when they start watching tv it turns out to be a joke . the most entertaining thing you find in there is the antics of the bad actors .|0
how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? i ca n't wait to see them . let me know if they are on the top shelf of any cinema . one of my favorite films is bad , so please be careful what you ask for ! it seems to me that every movie has a theme : a bad ending . that does not even make sense to me . i do not understand the story . i mean , why would we want something like this in the first place ? this movie was supposed to be about an old girlfriend .|0
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan. Now I am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. The four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after Vietnam.|1
although it was dark , depressing , and at times hard to watch , you are alone held my attention for a good while . that ' s when i saw something interesting : two large people on the ground with their backs against the side of an suv . the first one was bleeding badly from a hole in his head , the second was still alive and was trying to move . after about thirty seconds of watching , i decided not to bother . if i had n't been forced to watch this , i might have stayed home and spent the whole day looking for them .|0
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz.|1
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead' was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore-I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before watching this.|1
"I think ""category 6: day of destruction"" was very unrealistic. The digital effects where like a children's cartoon. The actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny!Please keep the special effects real.I liked the comment: ""What did we do to p.i.s.s-off Mother Nature? ""I don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines."|1
i ca n ' t quite explain why i find this so alluring and ` ` the leopard ' ' not ; it may be a good thing if there is some sort of connection between the name of the book , which contains all of its characters , and the title . after all , i have seen it before on television in my youth , and most often in movies , but this time i could n't believe it . this movie , with the cover image of an old man with grey hair ( perhaps the age of his clothing ) , makes him look as though he has gone to hell .|0
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost £20 on ebay. Add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it.|1
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he's had his successes and failures, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: They will be something unique.|1
i think my summary says it all . this mtv - ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a man who has been shot in the face during a shooting . that is , if you want to make fun of him for wearing such a bad face . i am not saying this guy is not hot and attractive , but the way he dresses makes me feel like i should n't judge him too harshly on what he is wearing . at least i can say i have no problem liking him despite his looks . i find myself wondering what made him choose to wear such a terrible picture .|0
return to me is a movie you will want to own . it is a story of inspiration and family life . there was an old guy in the car who loved to drive his wife around in her car . they would stop at this fast food restaurant and just eat like nothing ever happened . the movie is about a man who lived through the same horrible experience as his wife , who had to find a way to save him from a terrible death that killed his wife . she died on their wedding night after having been cheated on by his lover .|0
At first I didn't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by Lauren Ambrose.Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts.|1
go get your camcorder , your little brother , and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on you . i 'll just watch a movie , see what happens , and make a joke later . i have no sense of humor . i was told that it was an alien movie with bad graphics but it seemed more believable than a movie at the time . i am sure this story is only made to look like a movie , but i do n't think it is . i never had any doubts about the authenticity of this story , not anymore .|0
Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's, there's too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla&The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. Matches.|1
i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load i have ever watched . i have always wondered how these films would have been produced if one of the people from my planet had not chosen the film , but i guess it has gone beyond that question when you are forced to witness the whole thing , even if it does cause some damage to the actual scene . unfortunately for me , this film was quite interesting and i just ca n't wait for the sequel to play out on the screen . i hope you feel better tomorrow .|0
"Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting ""whitey"" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's."|1
This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better than this) and Blackadder (Not better than this).Mr Bean is a no talking, human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof.|1
i loved so much last bellocchio ' s movie , the masterpiece ` ` l ' ora di religione ' ' . it had a long and colorful history of some of the old movies but was just too dumb to be good . this movie was very well written about an area that appeared to be made up of ancient ruins . its original purpose was to take a look at places like egypt or africa . however , i know that this film has lots of references to the mayan calendar . what is even worse is the fact that many of the characters appear to have come from the same country as their descendants .|0
The Mod Squad isn't a movie, it's a void. That's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  I'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever, seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no-one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike. There is no plot, there is no characterisation, there are no set piece action scenes, there aren't even any scenes as such, just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second.|1
"it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. I rented this ""movie"" cuz of the drop ""h.p. lovecraft"" on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver!"|1
i believe i share the same psychological outlook on the world with kieslowski . he is polish , i am danish , and we all find it funny that in a language that is so much alike , people ca n't make sense of the way it is made up . kieslowski has been in the air for over 20 years and he has never had to be anything other than english . you might have thought he was one of those movie - star types . there is not one negative thing about his life at this point , and i must say that i am surprised that they chose to give him such an important role .|0
"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf""."|1
this is one awful movie ! ! some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i am disappointed in myself for thinking differently . i mean , really what the hell is the point of this movie if you are going to watch it ? no one can do anything else than watch a horrible movie like this ! ! ! there is no real meaning to this movie unless you happen to see it at all , which most people do n't . so it just kind of blows your mind after seeing it on television .|0
"Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.To break Julie's ""goody two shoes mold"" she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction.The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy."|1
A recent re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri.|1
A small-town schoolteacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! Soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (Samuel L. Jackson).This was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? After all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was an all-around good time.|1
even the trailer for this movie makes me cry , like the first time i saw this movie . not that there is anything wrong with this movie ! ! ! it was a horrible movie , and i would rather watch the movies alone than watch it with people i actually like . the plot is so bad you might have to pay to watch it at all . anyway , i think the best part about this movie is what the characters are doing . they are getting along just fine and acting great . in fact , it seems they could be playing a double act as they try to make each other uncomfortable .|0
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy.|1
A vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.|1
this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life . it is a complete waste of money . i mean , we were looking for an actress , not a real actress . what do people like to do in a movie like this when they really want to be acting ? so far , this film has been one of the most original and unconvincing movies i have ever seen . i would n't mind doing something like this again myself . but i thought that if i put on a big enough show , everyone would watch it .|0
DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, although way hotter than most low budget starlets, is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I ain't trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick.|1
this film was utterly horrible . stupid premise , and horrible acting by all . whoever wrote this trash should have told you how awful it would look to the public . not one bit of any of your other friends is even remotely funny ! but that does n't make any difference . it just makes no difference . i wish everyone would come up with something good about this movie . i know what you are looking at . the actors are pathetic . there are some great things about them , though . first off , they get a real chance to tell us what they thought they were going to say .|0
it is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial ` ` wake - up call ' ' . and , i 'll tell you , this is a good one ! do you remember the last song ? in the beginning , i was really hoping to get a word in before the show starts . i think i was disappointed when it just ended . i thought it would go better if it was an episode or a story . but , that 's not the way it ends . as i said , every time someone tells a story , the audience reacts to it like they have seen it somewhere before .|0
Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and I spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie even though I have a weakspot for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.|1
tdy is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection . they take it way too seriously . i was really disappointed at first when i saw that part of the film . i did not understand a lot of it , especially in this movie because it was so cheap and dirty looking . but the fact that i bought this dvd does not prevent my mind from drifting toward the one place that i thought i wanted to be when i went to see it . i had hoped to make it to san francisco , but i knew that was not possible .|0
spoof films have come so far since mel brooks in ' the producers ' ( 1968 ) said ` ` do n ' t you think that is a good movie for it to be ? ' i just ca n't get over what they did to this one . if not for the fact that it was filmed in such a small area , the story would all be written by now and none of the actors would even remember how to talk about it . there could be a number of characters who would have had difficulty talking about something as absurd as a star wars dvd .|0
For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.|1
i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil . shame on india for not sending this movie as a movie , it makes no sense whatsoever . i could use a better film to explain my own views on this movie and i found myself in such a funk that i barely made the effort to watch it when it was finished . now if you want to get something really good right now , do n't hesitate to make up your own mind to do it . but i know that is unrealistic . let me put it like this .|0
I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting.|1
"""Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own"", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....Major league baseball....but not to worry, ""Mr Baseball"" is there to try and change all that. But just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. The storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on."|1
Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious.|1
"Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"", which covers remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic."|1
I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that I've owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of- it was so worthless that I couldn't see ever wanting to watch ANY of it again.However, I do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 pages of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars.|1
Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the film.Cobb doesn't know it, or doesn't let himself realize it, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the business from union organizers.Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. He's shocked -- shocked!|1
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped airing it. I wish Indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days.|1
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me.|1
This great film never showed up in my town, so actually I didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. The tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so I hope to see it once again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it, if you ever have the chance.|1

this movie , i would like to say , was completely great . i can see how many people would give a million dollars to see this movie and even if they had seen it they would not be interested in watching the original movie . i personally know that this movie was really good and i think some of those folks are still trying to enjoy it . but i ca n't quite remember which one of the three is the real deal . i could not even figure out what made it interesting enough to make an effort to watch it .|0
my friends and i watched this movie last night . it was pretty incredible . by all means , this is one of the great films you watch . just to show your appreciation , i should also warn you that this movie has been in print since 2012 . some of the filmmakers who had a major role in this film have lost their way , but i believe they managed to get an idea on how to fix the problem . i would say it was a lot more complicated than it looks . i hope you like it , it really helps make people feel less uncomfortable .|0
Like a lot of the comments above me, also I though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as I will explain a in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking.|1
this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s . otto preminger directed only four or five really interesting movies in his entire life but he has a few good ones and i think they can have some good points with the other two . it 's a great movie that makes all the difference in the world to these guys who were raised by a family of drug dealers and forced to kill themselves to survive . it was one of the first shows i ever saw and it was an incredible success . the producers gave us a special treat because they did n't want anyone to come along to watch it .|0
there is a lot to like in this film , despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about a woman whose marriage was broken by an ex who had fallen in love with her boss . however the characters do n't have any real connection and the script does not make any sense . i think that when you look at some of these scenes as a young child , you see that there are many holes in the storyline . but what really baffles me is one of them . it goes back nearly ten years . for example , i was reading through this book when i heard the door to my bedroom open .|0
rabbit fever is one of those film oddities . it ' s an enjoyable 90 minutes , demands little of the action and drama . when they are over , they just end up with a few bits of popcorn in their hands . like i said , my favorite part of the movie was the scene where you come across two young girls getting ready to go into their apartment and get ready for bed . they were dressed in all sorts of skimpy outfits . that ' s when you see a man standing in the doorway with a camera sticking out of his back pocket .|0
. . . but had to see just how bad it could get . the plotline was thin to begin with , a lot of people were dying , and the idea of taking a job at one of those companies gave me an idea . i 've never met anyone from the industry who has money like me , but i know enough to think about how this is going to look when i tell my boss that i am going to try to find a job . there are some really good actresses on the staff , and they may be interested in being my date for this little party .|0
this movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects . scenes where father merrin is tossing his daughter into the air and catches her by the wrists as he pulls her down to the ground with him , and that ' s when she starts screaming at the top of her lungs . there really was n't much point in letting the movie get away with it . i just did n't want to watch it - i loved it . i like a lot of people , but this movie was just plain terrible . the premise was bad ; the acting was awful ; the actors were totally inept or completely insane .|0
for an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 , but in general it was . i really do n't give a crap . i just think the first movie should be more romantic than that . as we were walking up the main street toward my house , i could see a man and woman walking hand in hand . at first i thought it was a couple or two old folks going to church , but then i noticed it was a girl and a boy with their arms around one another . they were laughing and joking about nothing in particular .|0
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse.|1
when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought ` ` god , this is horrible ! ' ' but i like it . if i see that movie then i know it 's terrible because the dialogue is atrocious , and the cast is not all that good either . this movie did seem to have an unwritten theme with a little bit of originality but the plot was quite sad and rather dull compared to those of my previous movies . i guess what i really mean is , i had no idea there were such things as bad actors and bad stories .|0
"While not as bad as some movies (like the horrible ""Atomic Twister""), ""Meltdown"" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a Masters Degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.Riding the false fear that a Chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an American plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area."|1
kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times . he may have made more classics than anyone else in the series . and it has been his passion as well , so i do not know how he died . there is still some left to read ! if you want to find something , keep reading . your book will be out of print in only a few weeks . after that they can make an issue of this film . just let it play for one or two minutes . i love my movies and would never recommend this one to anyone but the director of this movie .|0
"writer & director jay andrews , a . k . a . jim wynorski , serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a different kind of character but there are lots of differences . i thought it was nice that this guy seemed to be trying out for something bigger . he made it clear that he had the talent to put on a good act but when i saw him , it took all my patience and will power to not just let him know that i felt bad for him . "" "" how can you not want to kill him ? "" steve asked . """|0
"Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. Whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. The Radio DJ, ""we must stay on air"" spends effectively no time on air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the USA or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word ""zombie""?"|1
Historically awful. Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. Events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. Likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics.|1
This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film.|1
i was so ` ` impressed ' ' with tim kincaid ' s mutant hunt that i gave this one a try . the first few moments were hard and fast , but they kept getting better . the second time did not turn out too well . the third is even harder . it takes me a good half hour to get my brain around what i have just been told . you might think that i am a bit jaded at this game , but for the sake of humanity and the survival of the human race , perhaps i must be a little naive in the extreme .|0
His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace.|1
It's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.The movie is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park.|1
Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill's life upside down.|1
"rock star is a ` ` nice ' ' movie . everyone is nice . even the guys who are n ' t supposed to be on the team . "" he turns back to me with a smirk , but this time it looks genuine . he just laughs at his own stupidity and gives me a wink . i 'm about to break into tears again when i realize that if i let them , i was really going to have a lot of fun tonight . then again , what do i expect out of this movie ? there is n't much to recommend it , other than the main character is dumb ."|0
chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters ! i can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances are . it would take me years to get used to what they are all doing and at least half of them were made in 1944 . many of these films were filmed in south america , and i do not know whether this is because they ' re so bad that you want to give up on them and leave them alone or if it has some real relevance to the movie . whatever the reason , i sincerely wish this movie would be played differently .|0
i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual ` ` horror ' ' movie again . i had been disappointed with the story , because it was so close to true that i started to get some good ideas from my own experience . there was nothing wrong with a good film when you are going to go out on a date with a girl , and then just leave her alone for the next day . what did i miss ? oh , well , all i can say at the moment is that she was fun and cute and very funny .|0
are sea side resorts the sad , dreary places they ' re always depicted as in movies and novels ? certainly not on the coast of jamaica , but this is the only part that i ' d ever seen from the beach . why would anyone pay $ 30 dollars for a place to spend their time ? all it has to do is buy a bunch of seashells , a couple pieces of paper and a magazine . the people who come here are so unimaginative and lame that i was afraid of what they might have to say about us . how can we trust these people with our money ?|0
"in the european tv industry , movies like this one are called ` ` stickers ' ' . tv stations buy them at the market and sell them when they have no credits . after the movie is finished , i go into a bar to pick up a bottle of booze . the bartender asks me how much money i paid for it . i just say "" $ 1 , 29.95 ! "" so that 's where the trouble comes out of the show . as soon as i get it all off my chest , i feel sure i will regret it forever ."|0
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies.|1
i would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released . all these years later at the age of 14 , i can still recall a lot of things about the movie that are hard to explain . in fact , i can actually recall one thing that is very difficult for me to explain at all . i was an actress . not because i was young , but because i had been acting for my entire adult life . i did not like how people acted , or the way they talked , or the way they made themselves feel .|0
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film! 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind.|1
so , you wan na be a rock star ? see this movie . you do n ' t like rock , and it don ' t matter how much you love to have the stuff on the show , there is no way of knowing what might have been done if you would have known that music was a major part of your everyday life . you can ' t just give it up without thinking about it . but i didn ' t mind because it made me feel great about the whole thing . maybe i was just being overly generous .|0
Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories, well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force.|1
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. It really does grip you. John Paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.I imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but I wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.I think this film should definitely have a wider audience.|1
deep water ( 2006 ) * * * * ' ' it is indifferent . . . it ' s there waiting for you to finish your reading . when you are finished reading , take a break and get up to write another story on the way home . that will allow you to have a better feeling about the story because even if it ' s not as interesting as this one , it ' s better than the last one or the beginning . i love this film , and all the good parts , but the bad parts are great .|0
cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that ' s the trick . i can ' t put any words in my mouth to explain how this scene ends , and frankly it ' s hard to believe anyone who has never witnessed a movie is even remotely familiar with this kind of stuff . i don ' t know what i would have said or done if there was another person who had seen this sort of production at least once before . there is no rhyme or reason to the film : it is just bad movies .|0
"i was lucky enough for this film to come on tcm , so i had the opportunity to see it a few times before . you can understand why i did n't like it .

i watched this movie on tcm last night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) . i wanted nothing more in the world than to be a big star . but as the day progressed , i got more and more depressed . the worst part was that it kept getting worse and worse . i tried to look forward to seeing how this film was done , just so i could sit down and enjoy it . when we got to the beginning of the movie , i really thought it was over . but i was not totally wrong .|0
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike & his mate decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? Well, things backfire when Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of Sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament.|1
this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film , after seeing road warrior and experiencing the real thing in action . i have read numerous books which make me wonder why it was allowed to continue in this movie . as you may have known , the movie had a very bad ending . i mean really bad . i saw it with my own eyes but they were still pretty bad . the characters were obviously out of their element and were totally unprepared for what was waiting for them when they entered the movie . the first time i saw it , i just thought they were kids playing around .|0
the priest , into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love , but the process of love . it seems that i have only a fleeting memory of a story in which this is written . i am no historian , but i am able to point out a few flaws in these stories . one is that if you love someone , it can be seen as a betrayal of your character and behavior . another is that sometimes , when you spend time talking with the right person , you find that you do n't really like them .|0
this film has some flaws , and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening . possibly the worst thing ever was the director 's reaction to that movie ! it was absolutely awful . the director could tell he was not happy , which did n't surprise him but made him even more wary . the director decided to ignore the movie for now and just try to enjoy his time at work . by the end of the movie the director knew all about what was on tv , so he acted out every scene . unfortunately , he had no idea exactly what happened in that movie .|0
a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . incredibly bad . very pretentious . it would not be good to watch a movie in this kind of way . at least you get a great deal of time to enjoy it . your mind just goes into overdrive , and then stops when the movie is over . there is no real excitement , so the plot is lame . the plot is about as ridiculous as the rest of it , but it makes me wonder if the characters were really that much of a drama fan . well , here we are .|0
first off , i ' m not a firefighter , but i ' m in some kind of para - firefighting unit ( the type with real fire extinguishers ) so that could be used for something like this . all i need is one good friend who can tell me that this is the right way to go , and i would pay for it if he would give it a chance . even though i have seen the movies recently , i still don ' t trust any movie i ' ve watched with a few other guys .|0
"this movie is about pathetic , spoiled , ego - driven winers who think they have something interesting to say , performed by a bunch of losers who are going to spend their life trying to make the world a better place .

"" "" i 'll remember that when i get older ! you really should be watching this movie more carefully . some of the scenes look pretty bad on tv . "" "" yeah , not great , but decent ."|0
"They call this film ""euro trash horror"". Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's ""euro"". Trash? Ah yes, it's trash all right.You know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. Expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. Plus there's the sound -- at first I thought I was watching a dubbed film."|1
Philistines beware, especially American ones! This has all the elements you'll hate - a langorous approach to film language, a painterly sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well... If, however, you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of MTV/TV Commercials, then watch this.|1
"what a terrible misfire . not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda , so there you have it ! i just know it was a mistake for this group of friends to do this with us , especially my mom . we had been in the same school and our paths never crossed except during recess when we would pass by each other in the hallways . one day she came into my class and said "" well , good morning sweetie ! how are your parents doing ? "" i could see from the looks on my siblings faces that they were worried that i might be an evil character ."|0
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's angst ridden self portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish.|1
"I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say ""Comedy"" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows.I've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far."|1
when i think of a 1970s - period film , this is not what i think of . i do n ' t want to be a movie nerd , but i think it 's the only one in my life that makes sense . you have to have some kind of talent in this city to make any good films . there are plenty of actors out there ( most of them are very good , and we can all see how wonderful the characters are ) and they seem like the type who can make fun of your name or act like an idiot .|0
"Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist."|1
Ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. The movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. Do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby. The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a pair.|1

This is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and mean masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action ? Well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the Alcatraz jail. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low.|1
Just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up.........|1
alright ! a sci - fi / horror / action b - hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg being attacked by a robot . i had to put my hand over my mouth to stop myself from giggling at the very thought . the story is funny , even if it is somewhat silly . some of the characters are interesting and some are n't . well , some of the characters may be humorous , but i ca n't stand this one . the only other thing that really bothers me is the way it seems to be portraying alien life forms .|0
overall , i give this film a decent 7 . 6 . to start i ' ll say i love how the character moves and the way they get along . on the whole i think i would rather go home and have fun doing something else . but do not waste your time . you should read this book if you are having any trouble with the characters . there is a good chance that you will see the same kind of scenes many times over . at least once . it sounds like this movie might be very bad .|0
"bonny hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut . minnie driver and david duchovny have that indescribable something called "" baby "" thing going on , and i am the only person who can figure out what it is . at any rate , i ca n't even tell you why it is important or how to use it for that reason . so i had to put in a little extra effort before they gave me this book . the title of this book is not too great , but there are some good things about it . the characters are well - suited to their own kind , and the script is good ."|0
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB). About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star Hugh Grant or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences.|1
i hope this is n ' t a portent of things to come . high - definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time , and it looks like most of my friends are not even aware of what has just happened . while i wish they had been at the concert , i also wish that they were here now . i have spent the last three days in the bathroom trying to take some of my anger out on somebody , and i really feel like it is the end of the world for me , so i am going to enjoy the rest of this week .|0
"I don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of ""Duck and cover"" or ""Protect and survive""!Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track 'Kinky Sex Makes The World Go Round', and you're pretty close to Whoops!"|1

mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with kannathil muthamittal . such an amazing relationship between parents and children is so remarkable in this tale , it puts me to sleep for a while . i would like to thank some of the people whose stories i have written over the past four years . one of the reasons i decided to stop writing was because there are no good comedians on that show , so i did n't write it . i just hope you can find your way through life to feel what you want to feel .|0
wow , i was really disappointed . i was n ' t really planning on seeing this movie in the theater , but i thought maybe you 'd be interested to watch it with me . if you are and have n't heard about it , well , i guess we 'll get to that in a moment . as i said , this movie is really interesting . at least i think it is because of all those funny scenes . however , i would give my right arm to see something more amusing in this film than watching a silly movie where someone is supposed to die .|0
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag on and on.|1
"Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: ""go to hell."" thanks. it had to be said!"|1
george sluizer ' s remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time . why was he so stupid and foolish as to put it in a movie about himself ? no one knows the truth behind the series , except me and my friends . i did n't know what this movie was all about , so i made it myself . there was no point trying to find out who the original owners were or what they were up to . the idea that someone would do something terrible and kill someone for no reason at all is beyond me .|0
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. Rene is FINE!!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone forward me his contact info?My friend thinks Flex is the finer of the two. She's been a Flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. The cousins were funny and just as trifling as Nana described them. LOL.I am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.|1
my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of BAD IMPROV but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient.|1
"Found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown,(Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. In one scene as Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed),""Dead Sexy"",01."|1
being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly ! ! i related to the character ann august more than most ' s young children do , but i have never really read the movie . in fact , i can not recall ever watching the movie . my opinion is that it is a very bad sitcom . the plot is horrible . i am sure some of the characters are horribly inept . however , they would have seemed so good to me at the start of the film . there was absolutely nothing to show about any of the characters or how they came to be here .|0
your idol will deceive you in this movie . stephen nichols is mis - cast as a young german student still bending the rules to his own detriment . i am sorry , that film is such a pain in the ass . there are some people who like it and some who hate it . however , many of my favorites have been cut short . if you find this movie sad , you should look for other ways to go about making them better ( which may not be entirely accurate at this stage ) . the only real problem being that stephen nichols ' films really suck .|0
An under-appreciated, unseen gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It's not unlike Born on the Fourth of July, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-Vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc. ), this one deals with a much more personal topic: Family.|1
"Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We picked ""Ik ook van Jou"" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current Dutch filmmaking.The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world."|1
this is a very enjoyable , fluffy , glamorous musical from the 40 ' s . ' cover girl ' made rita look like santa claus . you might think it 's funny to watch this show on television and tell us that this was a very good one . we all agree that there is something very sad and tragic about the movie . after seeing the credits , i would not wish to watch it again since the ending is just too terrible . in fact , i will never get used to such a bad movie ever again . its just horrible .|0
"Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable."|1
"An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the film she ""throws back"" the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur! The high-toned English set she moves in is such a clichéd bunch of harummpf-ers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! ""My violeen! How weel I ever play eet again!"" ""Patreecia, my meelk is cold!"" It's campy beyond belief."|1
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously.|1
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits.|1
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3), this is fast-paced, in your face, rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken.The story lines are spurious, at best, but it's deliberate, as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters.|1
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison, is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English. Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.|1
i think shane black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever ! he gave us the awesome movie to make our characters look cool . so far , it has not failed and we have an awesome movie with lots of plot and fun comedies that no one else enjoys . but i just saw this movie and i do not know if it really makes any sense . in fact , i ca n't seem to figure out why it should be ' scary ' . the whole thing was a complete waste of my talent . i did not learn anything by watching this movie at all .|0
cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something . as you probably know , i am not a really big fan of horror movie movies so i have seen them a couple times over the past few months but i never expected one to be like this . when i first saw this film it was just an indie film and i thought it was a total waste of time . i watched it at my university in new york and i think i enjoyed the whole thing .|0
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito. The series' star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think, if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor).|1
"The minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. Then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.This was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (It displays some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's earlier ""Brute Force"")."|1
alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mis - marriage in 1941 but his heart does n ' t appear to be in it . the movie has no plot , as far as i can make out . i am sorry for the film , and wish i could have seen it instead of just being on my own . you see , the idea that this movie has an opening in the mid - nineties is laughable . what kind of people would ever want to create a sequel to a classic movie ? if they were n't so lazy they would have tried something else .|0
"This movie took me by surprise. I first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. It's got it's just plain boring points, and I, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, ""What the hell is this?"|1
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth.From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle, which makes for superior suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety!|1
Im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw away your life, don't see it!I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!I think this movie is a work of the devil.|1
Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly.|1
the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts . you must watch it for its strong characterisation in the story . i think most of the actors are extremely well - spoken and they actually have a kind of good humor . however , they seem to find it rather irritating when the acting is so atrocious as to make them sound bad , especially on tv . the best thing about this film is that people who were once treated with a lot of skepticism by the producers can be pretty easy to relate to . maybe this should have been a better movie or even a more exciting one .|0
filmmakers made a rather boring everyman ' s story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home , which it does . this one is about the ex - boyfriend who runs away with a girl he meets while she ' s out clubbing with her sorority friends . they ' re both having an affair and are both trying to be nice but there is a lot of tension between them and they don ' t know why . i have seen these movies as a child but not so much in my life when i was young .|0
rififi ( jules dassin - france 1955 ) to me , it seems a very risky idea to attempt a movie . i ca n't imagine what it 's made of , how it is supposed to portray itself or the character , and i do not believe that it is worth taking part in such a huge operation . after all , i ' ve seen far too many films like this as well , which has led me to question whether there is any way that someone could possibly make up some outlandish story about a serial killer coming out of the woods .|0
go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam. despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the cliché writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam.|1
half past dead was unlike any steven segal film i ' ve ever seen . very little of segal , himself and the others is there in the credits . this movie would have made it better , but we are too far into the sequel to be anything but a joke . after a number of minutes of watching the same thing over and over , i got bored and decided to watch a few more . i just could n't resist . i started reading all the reviews on the internet . none of those were good , but some of them were well worth listening to .|0
the most amazing film i have ever seen . i did n ' t read the programming and i just stumbled onto this movie for fun , to see if i could find out more about it . unfortunately , a lot has changed over the course of time . there is not much else that can possibly be good enough to get me to do this movie . i was in love with this movie and i had already made up my mind when i sat down at the cinema to watch it . but i was so caught up in what was playing out in front of me that i lost track of where it went .|0
the first episode of ' man to man with dean learner ' that just aired was at least up to scratch . i liked it , and it had a good beat . in fact , i thought it looked so good that i almost forgot that i had watched it myself . even though it was only seven minutes long , it was one of the best shows i had ever watched . i felt like i had never been this happy before . it seemed surreal to be watching this show after having watched every episode . i must have said the same thing to my dad once or twice .|0
1. I've seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best!|1
the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie characters in the movie . the only reason we have the talent to make this work is because of the fact that the production is extremely well known and it comes across as one of the best movies in the world . i ca n't believe that you would even think of doing this for your own personal gain , let alone actually writing it . this film could not have been filmed without the assistance of someone who knew what he was doing , so please refrain from giving me any such lectures .|0
"""Strike Force"" or ""The Librarians"" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie."|1
oh how awfully this movie is ! i do n ' t know if it is a horror film or a drama flick . let me try to make the ending interesting . the main characters are actors from various different genres of movies - none of the ones i saw was anything like this movie . the plot may have been a little old fashioned , but the dialogue was great . and the acting was all wrong . the casting was horrible . one thing you could say for this movie is there is nothing bad in any of these movies , unless it comes around the age of thirty .|0
i ' m a big fan of surrealist art , but this film by bunuel ( with some ideas from dali ) does not go far beyond the range of my imagination . it makes no sense to look at other films in the genre as they make no sense to me at all . for example , you would expect to find a piece of art like this lying around looking like a pile of rubbish . this film is made by a famous director and his friends that have had a taste for the classics . this film must be worth ten grand .|0
very odd , this seems like a very average movie to me , if not slightly less . it is also extremely boring ( especially for an amateur movie ) . the plot is so stupid that i just could not figure out what it has to be about . it was as if the script were written by a bunch of clueless actors and actresses . there are some pretty lame lines in the story that i have to reread every day or so to make sense of . there are a lot of things that i just do not understand .|0
ah the sci - fi channel . how often do you disappoint me ? quite often i think , do you ever stop to think that it may be a trick of the eye or an attempt to ' improve ' your own reality ? let me say that this film is one of those things you will never see in new york city . what have you got there ? it must be more like a science fiction horror than a sci - fi flick . when did this movie begin ? i thought it was about aliens and earth . where did this come from ?|0
In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi (e.g. The Score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. This one apparently demands and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master.I was on the edge of my seat throughout. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of its day.I would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.I cannot give it enough stars.|1
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here.|1
"Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough? ), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!)"|1
between the ages of 30 and 51 , when he died of a brain tumour , zachary scott made 70 . that is an average of 25 years with no record of it ever being found on tv or in any magazine . if you want to read more , please consider leaving a review here . i know one thing for sure : it was not like my mother to be so mean towards someone who just wanted her daughter to work . but then again , what makes this woman such a bad judge of character ? well at least she had the sense to look good in black slacks and a tight - fitting blouse .|0
"I'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. The series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It is sad that a lot of the ""usual"" characters died but, damn, we had a lot of nice NEW characters.Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series, the plot."|1
"A man kicks a dog 2' in the air.A woman kicks a cow out of her bed.A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.A woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.A man kicks a blind man in the stomach.Jesus rapes a young girl.There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this ""shocking vanguard of cinematic expression"" would appeal. But I found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade."|1
"I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those ""make you squirm"" buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a disspointment."|1
the man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic ( and a very good one too ) . in this movie , the film starts off innocently enough ... until someone tries to kill him . then it seems to die out quickly . i just wish i could remember exactly what happened after that . i really should pay more attention to my other films . they may have an interesting story there . some of them are great , but others show no interest in the whole plot or the characters . when i watch this movie , i am disappointed .|0
* * * spoilers * * * feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love frances austen , sandy koufax , kate kennedy , and all of the female characters . this ebook is not available from the ebooks but has been purchased by the ebooks department at smashwords . the only reason you can purchase this copy is because it had some good reviews . the first two stories are based on historical events , but the last one is almost entirely wasted . let 's get out there and find out how much worse this movie could be before we make it to a single scene in a film with any character at all .|0
What can I say...not much to this one at all. Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are just OK. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No one else rose above mediocre.The story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere.|1
"I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view. I was sorely disappointed. From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it any more obvious? If that is the intended ""twist"" in this film, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem."|1
wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade , a half human , half vampire known the daywalker . he has no real idea where he is or what happened that made him become a monster instead of one of the living dead . and now he has a friend who also does not know his name ( in fact , it was never even mentioned ! ) because she has no idea why he chose her to take the test at all . if it were only possible for them to get along - they would probably live together for years and maybe even die together someday .|0
"also titled - - > the magical castle - - > this one is a stretch . why bother ? why create something that would just kill people ? they did n't make it for this film , so i 'm sorry to say that this film will not live up to its genre . let me explain what i want you to see : 
 by this time i have realized that many movies are only about good characters or bad dialogue . the first of these films was made in 1927 by a couple who wanted to take a vacation and enjoy some fun while they could ."|0
"I was expecting ""Born to Kill"" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. Instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a ""glamor"" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after ""Dillinger"" (an overrated movie but at least better than this)."|1
for reasons i can not begin to fathom , dr . lorenzo cameron ( george zucco ) begins injecting wolf ' s blood into the bloodstream of various patients . when this happened , most were in a coma and no one knew where they were . dr. cameron seems to like it that way , even though he knows that it could kill them . after all , there is nothing remotely funny about what goes on behind the scenes . some of the characters are awful , some of them are good , but none of them ever make a move to get close to any of the children .|0
saw this film during the mod & rockers fest in august . i was so inspired and touched . harry ' s not a bad guy . he likes all of the band , he just does n't like to be part of them . his only problem is that he wants to be part of the rock - star family , but it ' s difficult to understand how they do this . even for me , it looks like they get along . i wish i could see the scene with harry . at first he ' s charming , full of charm , good looks and great music .|0
man , i never laugh so much this year , and it ' s pretty hard to make me laugh . i ' ll be happy if you get a little more of that stuff from the other side of the camera , please . i really like my film but i can ' t keep it up for very long . do you mind watching this ? here , i have this cd - rom at your disposal . no doubt you want to take some photos . i ' m sure you know how many people watch this movie , right ? i don ' t see any of them watching it .|0
"Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career, spanning over 300 movies. While few (if any) would call him great, his films' obscure connections to underground culture (via reference, tribute, or influence) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films (""Piranha"", ""Humanoids from the Deep"", ""The Black Scorpion"", etc. ), without improving on them in the slightest."|1
i think this is a pretty good movie , but one thing makes it very interesting to me . it is about a young man who finds himself with the most difficult life of his life . the problem is that there is no way to get around this . if we are to believe that this character is in love with the girl , then this movie ends up being more entertaining than any comedy i have seen or been to . i thought it might be interesting to look at this film ; however , i was wrong . what you need to see here is a lot like the story itself .|0
"set mostly in the back streets of toronto ng is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into a strange world where the only thing you can make sense out of is someone being dead . this is about the most romantic and scary movie i have ever seen . it includes the "" big - shot hollywood actor "" coming to be part of an international terrorist organization that wants to eliminate the american people as a threat to our government . i read the film before i went to bed last night but could not believe what i saw ."|0
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it.|1
this is a crummy film , a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies . and a genre that was not very much fun . i have no doubt it would be quite interesting for the reader if they knew what was going on in there . i mean , i really expected it to be funny , even though i did n't see any of the jokes . it just looked dumb . i should have taken more time to pay attention to the script . who are these people doing this production ? and how many actors do those people have ?|0
"I feel terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by ""playing"" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! She only sings one song - the title role of an Lehar-operetta, that is really funny!"|1
"Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty! ), beautifully bad dialog (""Do you like... ribs? ""), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! My roommate rented this under the title ""Terrified"" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.Horrible movie."|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr.|1
the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling . this is one of the worst movies ever made . it makes you want to vomit and your stomach twist up at the same time . there is just nothing about any of these characters or their stories that really tells you anything . they are all just like everything else that has happened in the movies . if you have enough money and know how to watch this , then you get to go to the movie theater .|0
"Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: Sean Connery as the wily Arab sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that ""big stick"" to good use.Aided immeasurably by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg."|1
I watched Love Life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting, but as whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words.|1
"during an eight - year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films , only one was released by a local theater company in the 1960s . he lived in new york city with his wife for about thirty - five years , got his acting license at a small and relatively cheap theater and then moved in with his wife . now he 's working as an actor on this film . "" i know what you mean . they 've seen it three times since that movie began and are still not convinced . how long have they been watching it ? """|0
buyer beware . the alpha video release uses a print that defies description . the movie was shot in color , which i did not understand at first , until i tried to look at the images . i thought this book was supposed to tell you everything about what it was like on earth , but no one ever told me they were taking so long to load it . then , i found it on a shelf when i was trying to keep it out of their hands . the only problem is i got distracted from the movie by the sound of a male voice .|0
i saw the movie on its north american premiere ( july 14 , 2004 ) at the fantasia festival . that is why i am surprised when i read it . this is really good ! i hope i did not give you anything wrong . it was a very fun show . i mean , how bad can there possibly be for a movie like this ? it was about a guy who goes to his house and gets trapped by an animal . they say it is the worst movie ever , but i guess that is because we are going to watch it .|0
This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks.|1
ok , first of all , who in their right mind would remake hitchcock and second , who would do something like that ? and third , what in the hell was he doing with this film ? he was not a fan of country films , as well . he had spent most of his life thinking that maybe one day someone would pick it up and put it to use . so he had made an attempt to keep the film going , although he never found anyone who actually enjoyed it more . but there was still something wrong with it !|0
a lot of ' alternative ' comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular , misguided , overly - political , and unfunny . this has been my first criticism for this movie and it was an extremely bad one . not to mention , i have no hope that i will see the sequel to this film . when i saw the book on the market , i knew exactly how to get into the story . it seemed like an impossible dream ( or rather a very predictable idea ) but the plot was just as good . the only flaw was the lack of any other characters .|0
"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the ""Wackiest Ship in the Arm"" and the ""Pink Sub"" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and ""pirate"" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot."|1
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead, in its place, is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the Rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters.|1
"i recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst . "" "" what is that ? "" she asks . 
 "" it 's basically an introduction of the theory behind the development of the universe . if you ever decide to read this , i think you might like it more than me . there are some very interesting - looking characters out there , but i ca n't really tell whether they are just actors who want to keep their heads down and get better grades . these guys are actually quite good ."|0
"first things first , i am by no means a picky movie watcher . i ' m not one of those "" how much can you afford this "" fan - mail fans who ca n't take a hint and do something about it . for example , i could have gotten a copy of this to me at some point today , but i wasn ' t so keen on looking through it right away because i really didn ' t want to miss any of the action . so i decided to make myself look at the whole thing ."|0
"Okay, so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. ""Hell Ride"" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general."|1
years ago , i used to watch bad movies deliberately . somehow i missed this one . no gesture rings a bell . i must be missing something because when i saw the script i just did not want to see it again . if you have ever seen this movie , please make your own comment about me being stupid enough to watch this movie and i would appreciate it if you could recommend someone else . this book is based on the premise that every character in it really wants their characters to win . there are lots of places where the hero gets shot in some kind of horrible way and he goes insane .|0
this movie does n ' t have any pretense at being great art , which is good . but it is a really boring movie , and when i was young my father would watch it with us . it had one of those terrible episodes where he tries to read it out loud so everyone could hear him . i found out that if you watch it twice you will know that it is supposed to be a horror movie . the actors do not seem to understand why the movie is making so much noise . how can there be an audience for something like this ?|0
although it is n ' t mentioned very often , ` ` do n ' t look in the basement ' ' is a very interesting series of movies . most are comedic and have an extremely funny twist , so that 's a good reference . there is a major plot line that will be made for this movie and if you feel you must take part in it , then just leave the theater as soon as possible without getting paid . i really ca n't get over the fact that people who go to see a movie spend $ 20 , 000 to have a decent film done on dvd .|0
fair and nifty little science fiction / horror fantasy thriller about a well - known video game designer , allegra geller ( jennifer jason ) , has the title of a film that looks as if it would be made on an american tv show . she claims not to even know her movie was made on television , but i think she really knows how to pull off a good plot . i saw her at the movies several times in my life and never wanted to see anything else , so here i am standing in the middle of a large studio filled with all kinds of crap .|0
this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen , and i have seen well over 300 movies in the last five years . unfortunately , this film is very badly made and i will be happy to leave it unsold for a long time . as you can imagine by the way the credits are going , i have no problem watching it . there are many good comedic reasons behind the movie . it does not get any better than this . if you want to know the bad things that were done with the script of one of these movies , you should watch this movie at your favorite cinematographer 's house .|0
that ' s how i was when i walked ( staggered ) out of this ` ` film ' ' . i could not imagine what it cost to do this without a job . and they are all so dumb that their own films are the only way to save themselves . if you are thinking about your movie you can see why it is so hard to believe that any of them have been successful for this many years . but in fact most of those actors were morons who had no knowledge at all of how to work as a movie director . there was nothing good about these characters .|0
"first of all , i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph stalin 's work . in fact , some would argue that he was inspired to be the greatest film maker on the planet . but as you know , it was a big disappointment to any of us because we saw him at least half a dozen or so times throughout the entire book . however , one memorable event happened when the movie started . "" what if i ' m not the most intelligent person ever to live in the united states ? why ca ' t i do something like this ?"|0
"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990."|1
I'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.In relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge?|1
After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). Porn-movie level acting. Cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.Costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any minute.Nothing to really recommend in this film.|1
My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this should be good ol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all.|1
this movie was * good * relatively during the first parts of it . we have a story , from 3 points to 4 points , and we want to see how it turns out . there seems to be only about two or three minutes in any one episode , but that should be enough . so let 's get back to the beginning of this movie . i thought i remembered reading something about a big family who went on to make their parents work all the money . apparently they spent $ 40 , 000 with an uncle ' s girlfriend . what kind of friend are you ?|0
i thought the movie was sub - par . the acting was good but not great , the story was funny but no matter how bad your plot , you knew it could n't last . and this movie would have been much better if someone else had picked it up and played it . i was beginning to like these two guys a little bit . they always seemed like they liked the movie more than what was expected of them . one time when they were about to go out to a restaurant together he asked her to take him home .|0
Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.|1
i realize the line on my summary is not too polite . this film written & directed by scott caan & starring , jim smith , steve henshaw , tom jones , stephen king , andrew carroll , and a few other characters in this work . however , i prefer to refer to these characters for their good quality . there are lots of good qualities : the humor , the depth of character , and the overall storyline . even if you did n't care about all the details , it would be nice to hear from people who do . thank you so much for your critique , etc .|0
although this movie ( and i use the term loosely ) was made in 1997 , we just watched it a few weeks ago . what do you want to be when you are not a movie director ? do you want to play the hero or the villain ? have you ever thought that you might end up hating your job more than you love it ? did you ever wish you could hate it more than you love it ? there is no such thing as good movies because you can never understand how people should really think about their own lives . the world is so unfair !|0
well , this is new . . . famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror writer that works for the mafia . the movie has all of those in the genre and we have to try to understand why it could not be released on national television . if you are watching this movie , you know that there will be an explosion . i am pretty sure it would be one of the most painful comedy movies in the history of comedy . i do not think it is safe for us to watch these things because they are terrible .|0
I love this show. It's clever and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. As David Morse ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the show.I think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of Best Actor nomination. His only win was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. He actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross.|1
i love movies . . . and rarely do i see a movie that i hate . . . but this was the worst movie i had ever seen . you know , i never watched one of those bad ones where someone comes out on the stage and it is not so bad . . . just creepy . this movie was pretty much worse . i 'm sure most people around here are shocked at the first sight of horror movies , but these are real life shit . this is the worst movie i 've seen . there 's no telling how many years it has been since i saw a horror movie .|0
"this movie is bad , so bad that my mother who can barely stand the ` ` suspense ' ' of disney has to go into it and find out for herself . as if i did n't already know that there was a special place in her life where all the other kids would love to hear her sing and play the piano . i do not want to even begin to imagine what she would have said to those children when they first saw the movie . well , maybe "" you will get to meet him "" could have been better , but i really think the show must have gone way too far ."|0
it ' s 1913 . a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywood ' s next great - daughter and then , after an awkward encounter with his sister , finds himself watching a movie without any idea of how it ' s going to work out . that ' s when i start to understand why they make such a good set . the character is so boring . he ' s supposed to be clever but instead he looks completely clueless . the acting is horrible . there are too many wrong turns .|0
a stupid movie , with a stupid plot . feels like they threw every imaginable cliche in a blender . this film is so horrible that i wish i could just go home and drop off the dvds . why am i allowed to see this ? it 's a total waste of money for me to spend all that time on something so stupid . how could anyone think such a horrid movie was good enough to entertain someone ? what do i care whether or not it has a good laugh ? who cares about a lame movie if there is no good comedy ?|0
"This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, Mishima. It jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective."|1
"this film is a cash in . a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier episode of "" old world "" . i thought that was about all i could take with me , and that the rest of the movie should be more interesting . i did n't think at all it was going to be a great first book , but i suppose it may have been . i am sure you know this as well as i do . there are so many good comedies , films and dialog in this film that it seems they have nothing better to do than to skip over everything ."|0
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a film. The acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried.|1
no redeeming features , this film is rubbish . its jokes do n ' t begin to be funny . the humour is wasted in the end that it should ever have been made into a movie at all . the only thing good about this film was that it was a bit of a disappointment to the reader . i mean , you can see why i would be so opposed to this one , and i know i would not want to spend my entire career just sitting on a beach with two friends ( or even three ) while waiting for something like this to happen .|0
i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old . only ` ` the treasure of the american empire ' came to my attention when i saw this movie on the screen , about a couple of people who went out to dinner and got into a fight , they had taken a bunch of photos of the car accident , but there were not many in the picture , just enough to put a smile on my face . however , this movie was so horrible that i really wished i could have stayed in it for more than 3 or 4 minutes .|0
this weird movie from texas is about fallon , a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s ( although he was very handsome when he was younger , with dark hair and eyes ) , but i know what happened here . you just do n't see all these strange movies like this anymore . some of the characters ' names are interesting , but the dialogue is really slow . it would have been easy for me to read the dialogue without seeing the character , but i found it rather boring . anyway , that is another story that will remain an enigma to the reader until the sequel comes along .|0
certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics , which is one reason you should never consider this movie , because i was not able to purchase this film or any of the other films that will be released next month . as far as making it better than what it truly was , i did manage to make it seem good . the only drawback to this production is that the cast and crew were not all too eager to get on the road with a movie they had already been selected for and who knew how long they would be there .|0
ok , if you like yer monster moovies sullen , stiff , starchy , and thunderously dull , but with lots of room for improvement ! . if this novel is made available on smashwords at amazon.com or in print , please look for an example of this horror movie . while the plot was very good , it was so bad that i had to take a long break to get it under control . i do n't remember how many times i 've watched this movie , although i have seen plenty of movies during my time off . however , i am quite certain that the film does not make any sense .|0
"Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, ""Meet John Doe"" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital."|1
"This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there's way too much ""plot"", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct."|1
"` ` japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own ' ' , while that may be a good thing . for some reason , people tend not to understand the meaning of an english word until they see the movie in person . but even then , this was one of the first times i saw movies that went out of date . since you can see most movies on television , there are some really great things that happen . however , what happens in these movies is pretty bad . here , in the united states , it is called "" the french revolution "" ."|0
wow . what can i say ? i was born in 1960 . i love bad tv movies . love it when someone else has to live a life like this . they do have good taste in music . i loved all the classics . at least i did n't listen to any of them , i just wanted to stop listening to the movie . i thought it was great . i mean i loved the way the characters played with each other . i really hated those people . why are they making such an awful movie ? let me put it that way .|0
` ` opposing force [ 1986 ] ' ' was n ' t as good as ` ` dr . strangelove ' ' and it was n ' t quite that good either , but if you go through the whole film with a little extra flair you can get to see about a dozen other films in progress . some of these have got their own special qualities : the quality of celluloid , the ability to walk , the way they speak , how they behave . the most important feature is the fact that they do not take the lead for a movie .|0
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a Hill Billy. Her famous New England enunciation slips through, making lines like, ""I'd better rustle up some Vittles"" pretty ludicrous. She's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of American Entertainment well into the 1940's."|1
i am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this ` ` film ' ' . this is absolutely ridiculous and you will never believe how bad this movie is . in fact , it is not only terrible , but it is completely unfair ! if a writer or actress gets sick , they should just let the cast decide who dies . this movie was designed by an unscrupulous person with no desire to make money . this movie does not exist as we would expect it to be based on real life characters .|0
"hope the summary line wo n ' t irritate you that much ( it ' s a little homage to the chappelle show / charlie . "" i ' m so happy i ' ve read that one , but this movie is such a waste of talent and material that i ' m afraid i would have been disappointed if i had n't seen the part in the first place . there was not one interesting thing in this movie . the actors seemed like they were having a very boring life . well , the movie started off fine with some serious plot errors ."|0
i agree with all aforementioned comments . this show was a delight to watch . funny , witty , terrific ... and i have no idea what i was looking for , but i had to admire it . it 's nothing like anything i have witnessed in any of the magazines or movies i have watched . not only that , but i saw some pretty incredible stuff while on the job . it is a shame that my friends are watching this show . they really would like to see this show . even if it is a complete waste of my money and time .|0
as i write this in november 2005 i ' ve become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come from a movie set by a popular film company . it was supposed to be made in the 1950s , but the big change came during the last 10 years of its life span . so there are lots of old - school films , just like this one . but they didn ' t quite work out as i wanted them to . this is not the sort of movie that i thought would be fun for my wife .|0
"i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines . one exception for this is the film called "" the death of a man "" . it is made up of short stories that were not very clever or interesting at the start , but when they eventually made sense , they did n't have any other choice . the ending was pretty good and i thought it would actually be fun until the villain started talking about people in the movie . if you ever wanted to try a new movie , please take the time to think about how to get there and what to expect ."|0
"i saw this turkey in the theater , but i had a good time . the special effects are n ' t very interesting as long as you are too busy watching the actors . it seems like every single one of them knows what they want to do or will do . it is just so depressing . some of my best films are made in that theater . the movie itself was really bad . i could n't stand it . when i watched it , i thought , "" ok , let 's see if this thing kills people . . . i 'm not a big fan of horror movies ."|0
nightkill stars robert mitchum as a world - weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist ( mike connors ) and his wife . one of the highlights of my summer in new zealand was seeing andy holmes . after the movie is over , i get out of bed and walk down the stairs to the kitchen for a cup of coffee . it 's nearly three in the morning and i am really looking forward to waking up on a sunday morning . i go to the living room where andy is already at the kitchen table talking with her parents .|0
the most intense and powerful film i have seen in years . there have been other films before that delved into this genre of movie , but it has never been to my liking , so i had no desire to see it . as a result , i spent the remainder of my first week staring at the screen with a mixture of annoyance and curiosity . i sat down for a few minutes to get my composure back and try to concentrate on the movie . it was good , but not what i am looking for .|0
"This movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It looked like they made no effort to make the ""future"" look in the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). Additionally, its pretty obvious that Don ""the Dragon"" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film)."|1
"i do n ' t know what it is exactly , but the film is happily sitting on my shelf , with a few more titles . i can make out the title : "" to kill an assassin in the desert ! "" as if there really is a movie like this here . i 've never seen it , so i am not sure why i have seen it . i was pretty shocked when i read it earlier . i guess i liked it because it gave me a chance to look around for a bit and figure out where the movie went from there ."|0
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them."|1
when i sat down to watch greek for the first time , i was n ' t expecting a show with complex script writing . it started out as a movie about an ancient warrior who lived on a island , and his son killed him before he could finish killing him . that was after the battle of herodotus where he killed two warriors during the battle . ( i think there were too many people watching to know that . ) i remember that this movie was so poorly written that i made a mistake . the ending was worse than the characters had originally thought it would be .|0
one of chaplin ' s longest films up to that point , burlesque on carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex plot . while the film made her feel as if she lived in a different century , i think this is just about the first time she really let down her guard around people . it took me awhile to get used to the idea that she was such a good actress . even though it 's been two months now since we went to mexico , for all i know there could be a million more people out there at any minute .|0
from the portrayals of andy warhol in the films i shot andy warhol and basquiat , this is the type of film that might appeal to you . there is a lot of sex and moaning and yelling and screaming going on . it would probably be very easy to see the production with the actors being so excited but they would not have time to do much . this is an even better scene ; all the actors are having such a good time that when they start getting annoyed or angry they get confused and start shouting and making funny noises .|0
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career. I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD.|1
"completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game , this is another terrible movie by mr . boll . * * * * * 
 so , i must admit to myself that this one is just as bad as the first two . the main theme of the movie was that it was actually quite boring , and that was very annoying . the only thing that was good was the dialogue and the fact that it came from the ' 60s . i can still recall my first encounter with the film director : "" how long do you think this film will continue ?"|0
...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its a kind of mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge!

caution : spoilersalthough this film moved a bit slow at times , the brilliant scenery , richness of the characters , etc . . . but overall , it was pretty good . and in some respects , it seems like the most depressing movie i ever saw . the character is nice enough , but i can see why they would make something like that , especially when you get to be one of the star producers . the movie should have been done years ago and i guess there are a lot of other things that could have gone wrong . i 'm not sure how to feel about that .|0
"i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer rubin & patsy kensit . first off it 's called "" a horror film "" . while most of the films in my collection are funny , there is nothing that is remotely funny about this movie . you would n't find it funny if you had to watch it every night . when i watched it all the way back in 1975 i got really pissed off because nobody listened to me when i said it should be made into a horror film ."|0
OK, I read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position.Micheal, I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it.|1
great subject matter , director , and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film , told in that way so that anyone watching would not believe it had any effect on the movie . there is no question about it . as i remember , we all watched the movie in my dorm room while waiting for the play to begin . some of us were just too young to really see anything , and this was one of the worst movies i have ever watched . it was even worse because of how bad it was .|0
ever since 1981 , nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda . most ideas for this movie are fairly useless , but the characters seem to enjoy them . that is one of the reasons i thought they should be released on their own . i did not believe it was really going to get this far , and with so few options left , i decided to watch it . i had an idea about who could make this film in a movie . the premise was much more fun than the real thing .|0
"here ' s a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting / killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous and scary thing we have seen so far , it is hard to say what would have come out of this movie . 
 "" okay , i will tell you everything . i am going to start from the beginning , which is very important if you want to believe this story . i do n't usually watch movies like this in real life . i just watched my father when i was little but i had to get out of there before he started drinking his way into the house ."|0
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it's natural that I'd choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting.|1
katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - - and is thought by the local folk . i have never seen one , not even in my book , but i could see what it would be like to go up there and ask god for advice on this subject . i also know from experience that they will say that if i wanted to find an abortion , i had better come up with something good first . i do not have the heart to try to find an abortion without at least attempting to save my life once or twice .|0
William Petersen (that C.S.I guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. It leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or a pick up at the library but not much more.|1
I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a Mexican soap opera.Also the acting was terrible especially Charityn and her son. That's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. I'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means Dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.|1
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean.|1
"` ` the long kiss goodnight ' ' is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller , and a career breakthrough for me to have ! . i also had to watch it on tv one friday night when i watched it . there really was only one reason that would make such a horrible movie . at least this film should have been called "" movies like this "" in the 1930 's and then maybe even later in the 1980 's . what could be more classic than a movie about two people wanting to commit suicide ? well , i mean we were all looking forward to this movie ."|0
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...In this case, I guess it doesn't matter that much. The third Underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. They had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in.|1
this film , also known as ` ` do n ' t look in the basement ' ' is actually not bad . it is extremely entertaining , and i hope that there would be no reason why you should be disappointed in it . for a start , we are talking about a movie with an interesting plot - which makes you wonder how he came to create such a masterpiece , because he clearly does not want to have it in any kind of shape or form . this film is all about a man who is caught in a trap and killed , but only after killing himself .|0
one of the commenter ' s is wrong . this is not the only pat patterson film and he did n ' t do that in the first three films , which i don ' t like . it is bad enough that the new director is acting like a total jerk . i hope this movie goes as poorly as the last . i had no intention of seeing any of these films . this was completely out of my league at the time but now i can see why . the whole thing seems to be quite ridiculous . it was very funny actually .|0
The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's.|1
animated shorts just do n ' t get much better than this wonderful canadian film . this short feature is dripping with more than half of what i had planned to watch , but it seems that was a lot less than i had planned . there is no mention of the movie itself ( or of the person who made it ) , and there has to be some reason why these two have to be in so different places . as far as i can remember , the show was based on a documentary about an unknown individual who used all of his talents to save lives .|0
chupacabra : dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made . i had no idea it could be so much fun . in fact , if this film were not so depressing i would really like to see it . i am just not a big fan of old sci - fi and thriller movies . they all seem so stupid at the moment . for example , do you know what is so bad about the way they are portrayed ? i have seen a similar movie but i did not know that it was being used in any other form .|0
johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in poor financial condition . as you may see from my viewpoint , i am quite good at it because i used to like to get involved in these types of films . however , when i first started creating this film , i had nothing against the movie itself , but i never expected to come across the type of person who would spend so much money on something like this . i think it should be explained to me by some of the characters here for the sake of making eye contact .|0
even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this is n ' t bad ! in fact it ' s quite good ! but i could really appreciate a better one , especially with this movie . i don ' t think anyone has seen this film ( unless it was filmed at some point in the past ) , but i love to watch it for sport because if you watch it enough you ' re going to get to see it on tv soon . when i was growing up i lived in texas , where there was a mexican restaurant that served mexican food and mexican movies .|0
Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost.|1
what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director . . . but i have to say it did not work , at all . this movie would have looked great had it been just the two of us in it . the acting was poor , the character too dumb to do anything , and overall the acting was so amateurish you could make out its face even if you were n't looking at it . as you can only see one good thing about the film , there was plenty of nothing that is going to bring it to life again .|0
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their young son. The couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind. Upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous, tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza .|1
yeah great cult tv series . great atmosphere , top script and good performances make this a class a candidate for the perfect show . it would have been even better had someone suggested that these movies might be inspired to write a screenplay . although i really wanted to watch this one , i do n't mind watching a film like this because it gets you to feel as if your life depends upon it . it helps me to think of some of the scenes from this year when i was in high school , but this movie just makes it sound like there are other people living their lives here besides me .|0
there are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and shephered is one of those . i think this is a bad book , it has more than two plot holes to go with it . let me ask you a question - who is this movie ? did the original name mean anything to you ? for that matter , who were they ? i know it does n't , but i thought it looked pretty funny when i saw it on the cover . i do n't like movies where there is no plot hole , so i liked it even better than the last one .|0
i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid . i loved it . whilst the characters were quite different from the comedians , the acting was in fact much better than what you usually see on television . the first few scenes were just so surreal that i was afraid to turn the tv off for fear that someone or something might be watching . it took me a long time to realize that this movie is very funny and i started thinking more about how much i would enjoy seeing it in person .|0
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly ' s home studio mgm to realize his creative talent was in the toilet . well , i am not sure what would have been the point , other than maybe they ' d want him on tv so they can watch it . there are several films that seem to make this one sound like a success - at least once . the only reason i ' ve never seen a movie where he didn ' t try and prove himself worthy is because he didn ' t .|0
a tedious effort from not - yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not - yet un - bland actress nina foch , this movie was filmed at an old - school cinema . it was the first real production in hollywood that i had never heard of . it was written by someone with whom i had previously been on a very tight relationship and one day i had seen something similar to this movie on a tv news programme . no doubt it would have made good tv , but for the time being i just thought it was a terrible film .|0
for the most part , i considered this movie unworthy of a comment , but the last 10 minutes prompted me to think about some people who actually got it in their heads they should n't have seen this movie . you would think that when you saw this movie you would have thought it was just a bit cheesy , but this movie has an amazing character - telling style that can really cut through the crap . as i told you several times before , we had a pretty great time on dvd . the main character was cute , but not particularly hot .|0
An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! All in all, it's pretty silly stuff. I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects.|1
now , the sci - fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films ( house of the dead 2 , but not nearly bad ) . i think we all need to get ourselves into the game and see how fast we can win . i 'm thinking that it might be time for me to go out on the range and start looking at movies . this is actually a really good show , so let me just watch it . i should have thought of that before i decided to do something with my time . well , there are a number of great acting shows around here .|0

Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them.|1
"do not avoid this movie . simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious . it possibly should not be , but it has its attractions . we will get to learn from the characters one day and i am sure there would be plenty of entertainment in this movie . how long can you afford to waste time with a crappy movie like this ? well , here goes - 
 "" hello ! "" i screamed , trying to keep my voice down and sound as if i did n't have a thing to say at all ."|0
this is such a fun and funny movie . highly entertaining at all angles . it features an outlandish array of characters that could only have been created by the authors themselves . the main character in the movie is not much better off than the author or even the actress , and the cast consists of some of the worst acting anyone has ever seen . as far as people can tell , most of the stories are based on the same premise . however , there are some good ones and there are some really awful ones .|0
i ' ve just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days , and must urge you to try your best by putting it together with the usual story . this one has been written for a reason , and if you ' ve ever noticed that everyone needs someone who is really into it , then maybe you can make some allowances - but even so , this one plays a part in the film , and i ' m about to put it away . the first thing i do are give the final version of the show to a certain producer .|0
Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl!|1

"" "" it was a very nice movie , just not quite what i expected to see . well , almost as nice as the movie . now , if you had seen the one about the young man living in europe when he was born , you would know that all italian girls were beautiful . they were always looking down their noses at him , wanting to make his life worse , only to find out that he could do no more for them ."|0
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980's version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. Although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes, though.|1
This was my late wife's favorite film. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as I'm sure she would have worn it out. What can we say? A great romantic story and the push off of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow.|1
a few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure ( for a while ) things that we can relate to in order to make sense of them . when i first read this story i thought it was funny , but after a few hours they just made more of an attempt to ' find ' something . at the very beginning , there were two things i hated the most about the tale . firstly , the movie looked like one of those tv show shows where the guy who wins the prize gets a big bonus but the winner goes on to live with the other loser .|0
this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that . replace outer space with the south african desert , there will be no more stars to see . if i have to look at any of those films , it would make me want to vomit . the only person in the whole show who actually gets any pleasure from seeing them is my dad . the other thing is that the film does not have any character references , so it has nothing to do with us . when i am little , i loved these movies .|0

"- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -Not presenting itself as yet another remake of ""The Interview"", Five Fingers actually is. Alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. In fact, Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level. What I found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted out his ordeal."|1

when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason , and then one day a guy who happens to be gay comes over and asks me ' what do i do now ' . this guy actually thought he could convince me to sleep with him because he was going to find his girl in a movie and she would just marry him . i remember it as the most ridiculous movie i have ever watched . at first i felt like i was having a flashback to some horror movie where the actor has to make a fatal mistake by being seen by the other actors .|0
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.But Rita drives this whole movie.|1
okay it is terribly , and i mean terribly , easy to pick apart this film . c ' mmon what do you want to tell me next ? no , first of all please just wait and watch . i was not in a hurry to see this movie because i did n't think that i needed to see it because it was so sad . i thought it was a beautiful film because it was really funny and good . but it wasn ' t funny because at the end of the movie it didn ' t have anything to do with anything .|0
I didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible film from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialog, music, whatsoever! I don't mind a low budget..However you have to get some point. Wandering, wondering..pointless..then two boys started kissing in bed. awful,,just awful. I love indie films, don't mind it is slow. However this movie disappointed me from any perspectives. Even the Graffito, not artistic.I was wondering what kind of people would like it.|1
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while on an assignment for Germany.The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. I loved the film. Some will say it's a ""chick-flick,"" but so what. It's wonderful. Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped."|1
this is a romantic , albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites . it is one of my favorite stories and i really love reading it as a child . i never liked the title so i would n't know what was coming next if i had to see it for myself . in fact , i can not remember the last time an action movie ( or movie ) has shown itself in the theatre . there is a big screen that looks like it might be made of rubber . this movie is almost totally useless .|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection.|1
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. At first i thought that it was going to be good because I'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. Next time the guys who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.|1
I saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as I hit the street, like ... you see, I can't even think of one!|1
this movie was pathetically awful . the sound was terrible , the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating . but the plot was just as horrible , the characters really did n't need any help in their portrayal . i had to sit through a scene where one of them got whacked on the head by his partner and it took him some time before he came back to life . the film has so much negative connotations that makes me wonder if anyone actually noticed what was going on . when it is over , the credits do not roll , and the show dies .|0
perhaps the wildest outlier in alfred hitchcock ' s career is this straight - out comedy vehicle by the director , pairing carole king and her son on the road to disaster . but there really is nothing funny about the whole episode . i do n't think i ever saw anything remotely funny about it . as you can imagine , i would not have picked this film as a good first movie for myself . it could have been worse . the plot was far more comedic when it was done . all the actors ( at least the acting ) were in their mid fifties with a few days off .|0
"i ca n ' t believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb . this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . "" "" it was made in 1947 , and my mother died at a young age . no one knows the story or what happened to her . the plot is so bizarre i can hardly understand how anyone could get into a film that makes sense . i never thought there would be any good stuff to make a movie like this . if it does n't sell , you ca n't watch it . the characters are really funny - even if the actors are an idiot ."|0
it kicks you in the stomach . there are other films with more convincing characters , a more realistic story line and less of a romantic plot . i was thinking about my movie being a good way to pass time before going back to work . unfortunately , as soon as i entered the office , i immediately knew that this would be a bad idea . i was n't sure what else to do except make myself at home . i decided not to stay for lunch because i really could not deal with this one . i just needed a nice place to spend some time .|0
until i did a web search on ` ` what alice found ' ' , i did n ' t realize that the name could mean anything . of course , that does not make me any less frustrated with this book . it may even have been the result of more than fifty years of boring , boring editing . for some reason i never thought to look up the author and find out who this guy was . there was another time , when i was very excited to be a part of this movie . at one point in my life , i would have done anything for the story .|0
this is primarily about love in wwii , yet we must remember that it ' s also a biopic for dylan . it ' s not the kind of thing i would normally be bothered about , especially when you ' ve seen him playing on one of the big tv cameras , but there ' s something about watching him perform that makes people forget what movie he ' s been watching . it ' s an amazing show . i wish i could have seen more of it . it has some interesting characters , and even a few scary scenes .|0
i ca n ' t believe i even tried to watch this filth . as an avid b - horror movie fan , i had a great opportunity of watching it at home on the tv . i never saw or heard from my family ever again and i am sorry i did not pay attention to how bad this movie was . i do not know why i didn ' t stop seeing this shit before . i guess because i was just too busy having fun with my friend don ' t want to watch this stupid movie any more than i wanted to see this film for sure .|0
OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.Not to say this movie is not without it's problems.|1
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot doesn't follow on the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense.|1
"i was one ""chosen"" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game ""far cry"", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's ""the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail""."|1
this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality , and that i have . i was in a movie about four years ago as a teenager . for the next five years i spent more time in the theater than i did at my high school . but this is a different story . this film is so much bigger , so much stronger than most of the films on the street . it contains an entirely different perspective from the movies i 've seen since i was a teenager . you do n't really believe me , do you ?|0
Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. Plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed.|1
"I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. Only ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" holds up this well, performance-wise. As someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. Otto Preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style."|1
"""Out to Sea"" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance."|1
ken burns ' ` ` baseball ' ' is a decent documentary . . . it presents a clear origin of the game , and is very funny . i always enjoyed watching the cubs when they first came out in 1998 , but i was bored with all of them before i had to see one that made me laugh so hard that my stomach turned over . this is a really bad film for a little boy like me . even if i watched it again , i would be too embarrassed to watch it again because no matter how much i loved watching it ( which i do , by the way ) .|0
oh , the horror , the unspeakable horror of this film . if you can even call it a film at all . one of the most horrid movies i 've ever seen is the first installment in the serial killer saga and i will not hesitate to put you on my list of favorite movies to watch tonight . i 'm a little surprised they allowed me to see any of this ! the main plot is bad , the character has some kind of weird fetish , the actors are awful , and i like to think i know what people are like , but never have i seen a movie quite so horrible as this .|0
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film. On its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets who would like to look out for him. Nothing overly interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when Carrie is murdered.|1
"Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.Hearkening back to films like ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned"", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing."|1
"set in venice mainly on the lido , visconti ' s ` ` death in venice ' ' is a triumph of filmmaking ' . if you want to see this movie , then you should get a look at it for yourself . there is not much difference between the story and the film , though the quality is excellent . let me tell you something that makes this one even better . the dialogue is so good that some people say it could make a movie . well , actually it was an "" accident "" that ended up as a comedy ."|0
"i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10 . i went into this not realizing what it was - and i mean , seriously , the first time i heard something like that i did n't understand it at all . well , i really wanted to know what was going on and i thought that if i found out , i would probably never go through with it so i kept my distance . but i finally decided to see if there was such a thing as a "" bad boy "" sequel . in addition to being "" good boy "" and "" nice boy "" , the premise was completely uninteresting ."|0
this is a beautiful , yet simple movie about one man , driven to find an answer , an answer that would save his life or some kind of salvation from the devil . i can not get into how the people who were in it are doing this , so i am stuck with this movie , and i think there may be some real horror in it , but let me repeat that the film has no plot . if you want to go out on a quest for answers , you need only follow the road that leads directly to your search for something .|0
Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. For starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster.|1
"so me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up with the movies . "" "" yes , well i heard that your boyfriend dumped you at a hotel when he moved to la because he thought this movie was boring and he wanted to take it home with him . then he got an email telling him that this film was a load of bull . in fact , this movie is not even remotely funny . after the guy dumps you at a hotel and drives out of town without any explanation , where does the story end up being true ?"|0
there ' s a good story well hidden and never really used ! the film is short and overly dependent on its own character , but as you get to know him , if you are willing to read what goes down after he ' s done it , you will probably find this very boring . i am not so sure that this movie is the best idea . let me explain : this movie is supposed to be an inspirational story , but for some reason it just doesn ' t feel right . however , here ' s the thing : this movie didn ' t even take place .|0
I am a Talent Manager. I have been for 15 years now. I have discovered some wonderful talent. They have been in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion Eddie Monroe was cast wonderful. I love seeing the ability of real people. Not just a name. The Actors in this movie were very natural and believable. I was very entertained by this film. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. I still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.|1
"the many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last month , so do you . "" "" no , no , i ca n't leave it here for them to see . "" i held my hands up apologetically . "" but i promise to get rid of this film and start over somewhere new with another person . a different one . what about you ? "" "" well , the story does make an interesting movie . as in , if anyone is going to write anything worthwhile , they will be doing it ."|0
I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene.|1
when the noble hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping samanosuke clan , loyal retainer kogenta ( jun fujimaki ) is forced to submit to their demands that she be released from her contract . they threaten to kill her if she do not agree to release herself , but i can only imagine what this must have been like for her parents . how terrible to lose someone you loved ! in a sense , i did lose my own sister because of this . and now , i am so sorry , i have no idea how to respond to this kind of tragedy .|0
"the 1980 ' s ' my dinner with andre , ' with wallace shawn and andre gregory , is essentially a dialog for the sequel . "" i have to say i never expected to get to do anything like this in a movie . it really does sound quite good . but you can forget about that because i did get to watch it last night . when i got home i just sat there watching it for almost an hour wondering if i was supposed to watch it again . i watched it a few more times as well . it is not a great film , but the characters were funny ."|0
I found the Movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the film the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful He was real at his character. The ending took a wonderful twist. I would recommend you seeing it. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol.|1
five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping . were they run into each other as kids or did they hit it off and become friends ? why was this movie so interesting to watch when i had never seen a single one of them before ? no , i am not sure about any of the films i have seen . none of them are bad , they are nice movies . if you have not seen one of the movies from the previous year , i am assuming that you have not seen the movie by yourself .|0
"i was expecting this movie to be a stinker but i wanted to see for myself , but i was disappointed when it was n't . how did you expect an action movie that looked and felt very similar to this one to take place in the early 80s ? the first thing anyone would say about this movie was , "" it does n't even need a title yet ! "" it is an old horror movie . they were probably just too embarrassed by it to actually watch it . the second thing they would say is , "" oh my god ! "" this movie looks pretty bad !"|0
as a serious marathoner , i was seriously disappointed in this film . its target audience is clearly those who have gotten too involved in the characters and the dialog , they seem to be doing a very bad impression of what it really is like to go to school in a real english town . unfortunately , i saw some good things in this film , but most of all when i saw it i began to see something that i had not seen in a very long time . it is a documentary on the world war two , and you ca n't imagine how awful it must be .|0
I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script.|1
"If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Don't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I am a big fan of films like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of B-Cinema.But this film actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academy award winner!! The Dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. ""I will now Condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. The acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.The story?"|1
there are movies that are so bad , they ' re good . then there ' s movies like rest stop that are both awful and utterly pathetic : the worst one i ' m going to see is a classic of how people are treated for being stupid and not being able to make much money . i don ' t know what else to say to someone who reads my books ! i was never in any mood for comedy , music , or movies when i was a kid , and this movie could have killed me at any minute .|0
first off , i never got into dr . who until recently . honestly , i never got the opportunity to study him as much as i have in this movie . he is actually quite handsome and very pleasant when he is alone . no matter how boring he seems , there are moments that come to mind like some really great scenes or even a good story involving a character . the actors are nice and you can see them having fun in the theater . of course , those were the worst moments of my whole life .|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. The dialog was unnatural. Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense just wasn't there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen.|1
"i saw this film at the 2004 toronto international film festival . since i work in the wine business , i have seen it several times and always thought it a really good movie . however , my first inclination is to throw it back on and go home with it . if only i knew how much fun it could be . 
 "" hey guys ? "" i said trying not to sound too pushy . "" are you sure you want to do this thing ? i can make you a fortune if you are interested . "" we walked over to the end of the line ."|0
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. The acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid.|1
"my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of ` ` bad ' ' movies . when i finally got up to leave , i found some kind of strange stuff floating in the back of the truck . it looked as if someone with a camera set had thrown it on the ground by accident . we watched the whole thing from the back of the truck while our guys were getting dressed . there was only one thing missing : an old , beat up car . i mean really old . it felt like every movie that has ever been seen can be described as "" original "" ."|0
junior and his dad start a new life in a new town . it ' s the same life because junior high is about as exciting as you can make it . but this time it was much more exciting , even more so than senior high . junior high was not like normal high school ; i expected that from the kids who hang around during the day . i wasn ' t disappointed at all . when junior high is anything but boring it is an extremely boring one . however , junior high does have some of the most entertaining characters i have ever witnessed .|0
from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules ( 1983 ) , comes its even more preposterous ( 1963 ) . in the book the characters of this book are fictional , as are the actors ; the plot is lame . the characters do not really seem to care if a movie is going well or not . we know that they were thinking about making a good film and had hopes for an early retirement . in fact , i would be willing to bet it was one of those films where they make a major mistake , and then there is a huge scene where they have to work for a living .|0
"i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi , but this movie is just not good . the actors are extremely hard to understand . it seems that some of them have such an odd way of speaking that they can hardly believe their eyes . i have seen films like this on cable , but for some reason , i had never heard of this sort of entertainment . you get a lot of high - level horror movies where people get shot in the head or shot in the chest , but these are so awful that they could n't even say "" shoot "" in a movie ."|0
in 1968 , stanley kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by arthur c . clark . . . and it will be the first of many original movies . there are at least five other films that i have seen , but only two of these were real . the most interesting part of this movie is that it never gets to see what really happens next . i can only surmise that this film has some kind of predetermined date . i do n't know why anyone would want to travel across time to experience something so horrible .|0
"This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old ""cons turn good"" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', although nowhere near as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is Ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in Terminator 4.The MOD Squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy."|1
One of my all-time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film.|1
dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city . a low rent affair with no name , some of the most boring stories were written and they all had good plot twists . i 'm sure if you see this on any reality tv channel , it would make you sick to watch . i did n't think about it much , because i never wanted to see that movie again . it really sucked watching it again , like i said . this movie is one of the worst i have seen . it was very bad . it was not good at all .|0
this movie was terrible . the acting was awful . the script was awful . what was even worse were the reviews . i thought that at least they would have some sympathy , but they just ignored me and went along with the movie . i had expected a different reaction , but everything seemed so wrong . i sat there until the credits rolled . i walked away from the movie feeling bad . i made an effort to give them something positive to complain about . i think it was because i did n't find anything particularly interesting or amusing in the movie .|0
barely came trough the whole movie . . . acting is bad , dialogs are even worse . felt kinda st00pid 4 hours in a row . what the hell is the big deal ? i am thinking this movie was made only about 12 hours ago ! it seems like every film has about 5 or 12 hours in it . and for the record , that 's not all of the movies you watch . there are 11 things to watch before you turn your head . one of these ' s my favourite : the story of the little girl who had her baby on christmas eve .|0
Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one Rachel lived at as a child.They say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a Mayberry feel. Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces.|1
"This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be ""A Sandra Bullock Movie"". She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere..."|1
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.|1
i ' m an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in its entirety , i didn ' t quite see how to respond . i ' ll admit that i wasn ' t exactly prepared for this ending . the character is a total dick . i thought it had something to do with the premise of this movie , since the premise is very familiar to me . as a kid , i don ' t remember much about my dad and he was always on the edge of the couch looking out the window wondering why there were no people outside .|0
i acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it i found out that you guys are pretty cool . so i came back here to see if any of you thought this movie looked like it could be great , but was totally off - beat . i had only heard about it on a few other shows where they just said it looked good because it was good . i watched this film for a long time , but it actually did not take me as long as i thought it would . one of the worst parts of the movie was the dialogue .|0
This film has made e mad. I believe the original of this film ,'The Mask', was an awesome film, worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when i saw this, i thought again.This film has spoilt the whole idea of 'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother who is seven didn't even laugh, and he is into these childish movies, but this was worse. A load of crap!!|1
insanely well crafted mini - series . i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs . was heavily edited , but still managed to create a story that would leave you with a pretty good understanding of how people think of me . in addition , the main characters are very funny . ( this is probably just because they have such awful names . ) what 's so interesting about this book ? it should have been a thriller , like every other horror novel i 've ever seen . the premise and characters are terrible and the acting is bad .|0
I really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But, sadly, it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived.|1
* * * * spoiler alert * * * * my boyfriend , some friends , and i rented this movie . in fact , you are going to pay $ 92.99 for it . not that i recommend it . the film is really pretty but it lacks an awful lot of action . there are a lot of crappy movies ( like the one that ' s on my screen now ) . the most entertaining part of the movie was when we all started talking about these aliens and where they come from and everything . i just could not understand why people were trying to create alien technology with a bunch of little aliens .|0
There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.Here's what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer.|1
there are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst . saw is just that . the movie is bad . you can see this about a dozen times in three days , so you should watch this film all the time when it is n't going to make you cry . i do not have any tears to cry , but i was thinking of crying at least once a day . i do get teary - eyed for a little while after seeing this movie . i had thought maybe this movie would be a good break for me , but it was nothing special .|0
Bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry.|1
Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.The acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (Magaret, Rain, Hal).The plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable.|1
"It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half-an-hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so I naively thought). The mutt fails to look all that fearsome, which Leonard Maltin, the notoriously clueless/hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree with: he considers Cujo to be ""genuinely frightening""."|1
"I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of African musical - since people break into song every few minutes.None of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a ""tune. ""Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling."|1
this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least . the basic plot is 3 old business associates , none of whom can make any sense ; there is no dialogue between them and the characters , as they appear to be completely clueless about the overall picture . the acting is similar in nature to that which you might find in a horror movie , though i was not aware that the actors were even aware that these people existed . i am sorry to say that this film is really nothing compared to other films i have ever seen in the united states .|0
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization.Read Proust, you morons!! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies.Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, HOURS...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW!!|1
I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. This show had potential to be good. But my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in every episode.|1
"Korea's answer to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary."|1
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears.|1
"at beaverview cheerleading camp , the goody - goody two shows lucky ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the ' tough guy ' who wears a t - shirt that said : "" i am the tough guy . "" so it does not really make sense to me , but i found myself listening to their stories and wishing i had listened for more of one . when the boys left the game they gave each other a high five and then laughed uproariously at the whole thing . i could feel the blood rush to my face ."|0
this is probably wayne ' s poorest movie ; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role . as i walked into the restaurant , i immediately noticed that it was dark outside and no one was in sight . i realized after some thought that perhaps i should have paid more attention in the previous movies . maybe i should have taken note of what was being directed by the character who is now on the stage . let me give a quick review of the film : we were both disappointed when you came along and found out the plot was boring and there was nothing special about it to start with .|0
"Forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? A dial up internetconnection? Clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures (""He!"|1
when i watched this crap , it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire , which is actually a very bad one . the characters really do have no respect for the characters . i could see how it might be nice to have some real character - pleasing dialogue with people from the outside world that do want to understand us . as you know , the first movie in this series is called fire . if you were to watch this movie you would not only think that this was an evil movie but that there was nothing remotely good about it .|0
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales. I feel sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison, and so no more were made. It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. Still, it does at least make Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what doesn't?|1
"i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand . i was intrigued for the first whole year but after a few minutes i just sat down and started to wonder . "" he shrugged his shoulders . "" if you 've seen this film before then why would you want to watch it here , right now ? "" i thought maybe i saw something in the film that caught my eye or something but could n't figure out how to see it on the big screen . however , i found it to be extremely funny and amusing ."|0
"""The Bone Snatcher"" starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen, and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well."|1
"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski's ""Curse of the Komodo"", this still sucks...BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in ""Curse of the Komodo"", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........I don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! As in ""Curse of the Komodo"", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island!"|1
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios.|1
"One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in ""Wink Of An Eye"", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS."|1
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in twenty-first century Sydney! The last time any Irish gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!)|1
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but no - one would listen or do anything and then the rest of the movie begins . i had only seen the last episode when it came out , so i figured that was good for a start . i did n't know how much of it was true and how many parts of the movie it was based on as well . i never understood why the characters were such great actors , they acted so dumb , not even bothering to put on a smile .|0
"Acting 10, Script 1. ""Hurlyburly"" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. Even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ""ain't."|1
The material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.Give this one a miss....even Yancy Butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.I'm amazed people rave about Yancy Butler.....given what I've seen here and in the couple of other things I've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.Last thing is where was this shot?|1
"well , i ' ve just seen buster keaton ' s film debut in fatty arbuckle ' s the butcher boy and - despite the fact that he is an actor , this movie is really bad ! how could they have thought to make it out alive ? what if they are planning to start over from scratch ? what if they decide to throw away their lives ? how would they know who to choose to go after when there are so many other movies in the world on dvd ? "" you ' re a fool for thinking your life could be more exciting than this ."|0
in my never - ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime , i stumbled upon this film . it would be an absolutely unbelievable movie , and i was hoping i had seen enough to tell me what was going on . however , the fact of the matter is that i have been spending too much time looking around for a better place to live when i should have just moved back to san francisco to finish up the work i was doing here . i thought i could handle it , so why ca n't i ?|0
"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?)."|1
this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever . it really does not qualify for movie status . i may have seen it but i have not seen it . i wish i had looked around more to find something else to watch in it , but i never actually saw it . i only saw it for what it was . after seeing this movie , i thought it was a total dumb movie . it shows an odd amount of people that are too scared to tell their own story . you do not just watch those films at all .|0
"was excited at the opening to hear part of ` ` chevaliers de sangreal ' ' but wanted more so i bought it in order to help out when i had to pay a visit to the french ambassador and his wife . this is a wonderful thing for me , watching this movie where you ca nt tell what your characters are being sarcastic about . "" "" oh yes , that movie has been quite popular over the last 20 years , "" the host told us . "" as a matter of fact , it was almost my undoing ."|0
"I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the ""McHales Navy"" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too."|1
Dreadful. I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. I just finished watching the film, BTW.I love good cross genre films. This isn't one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, I'll watch them all. But you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.I love philosophical films. This isn't one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately.|1
this is one of those strange , self - important , self - indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound . it is actually an interesting comedy but it also lacks the dramatic plot and the plot line that you are accustomed to seeing here . it shows a certain depth of interest from the reader when they discover the real character who has gone off to become a hero . there is something about this movie that i do not appreciate . this is a show based upon what was said about the characters ' personalities .|0
even though this film ' s trailer and poster imply that sally hemmings was an important character , i might not want to read about her . it ' s hard for me to understand how she got so caught up in all of this . there is some sort of cult idea going on with the plot . if it wasn ' t such a waste of talent , i ' d probably have found it amusing . as you can see , they are really good - looking men who make their movies and spend most of their time on the internet . why ?|0
I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot!|1
"while the new pride & prejudice film is gorgeous to view , and the soundtrack is lovely , we are impressed by how well it was written . you all look great on the cover and the dialogue is amazing . however , i do want to say something that may have little relevance to this story . before i leave , i first wanted to ask a question in case you guys did not know . "" so what are we watching tonight ? "" one of the reasons my parents insisted on bringing me along on this show is they felt as if they had to watch this ."|0
Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'Department S' to sort things out.Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases.|1
". . . than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie . what was the motive ? the details of it are so awful i had to put up with them as long as they are not available in my home library . this film is an unoriginal series of movies that do n't really have any basis in truth , just a bunch of old - fashioned crap . the theme here is : 
 1 . we ' re on our own in a strange city where no one is allowed to know anything . there isn ' t a living person in sight ."|0
in this follow up to the naked civil servant we see the final years of quentin crisp ' s life in the film . when the credits are over and the audience applauds with a laugh , the picture goes black . it seems i was never quite right in the head earlier , because i saw some pretty weird movies on the way to my new job that showed a different scene . one part of the movie was just a bunch of crap about two guys ( who do not look like they own the film ) meeting their parents for the first time after having been married for ten years .|0
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes.|1
i suppose i like this film as well as any i know ; it is not perfect , but under normal circumstances i may actually have made a good movie . the premise is different , but it is the only one i feel that i would be able to relate to because of my experience with the characters . the characters themselves are horrible , but the actors make up for it in their best and worst . the plot is somewhat predictable . the director was a pretty good character until he was called on to kill his partner .|0
Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' And the saddest thing of all is that I actually agree with these people's sentiments. Yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them finishes off The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. That's about as scary as it will get, people.|1
"""Solomon and Sheba"" was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when I was a kid: a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that back then ""Solomon and Sheba"" didn't impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I had enjoyed a lot ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Helen of Troy"" and others."|1
frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it ' s hard to single one out from the other . maybe he ' d seen some action at his time of life , and made a big deal out of it - for the film , for the characters , for the way they portrayed their work . or maybe not . there is no way i could see him doing anything like this . i had an idea he would be a decent actor , but i really don ' t think that was the real reason why he picked this film .|0
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they 're life styles and pasts which support this.The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors' seamless acting teamed with Bechard's Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story.|1
to be honest , i did never read one of the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3 of this book . on the other hand i do remember what it is like to watch television at night and watch a movie when i was a kid . you have to admit , this is pretty hard watching a movie that does n't mean much in the way of fun . i watched my share of shows over the years ; there were lots of comedies but i always ended up feeling sorry for myself . this movie is even worse .|0
i enjoyed the mr . magoo cartoons i saw while growing up . and i enjoy leslie nielson ' s comic skills as well - they are excellent . the movie was a bit boring , but i did enjoy it . for some reason you always expect someone to be on top of the game . i think it 's my fault that the movie made so much trouble for me . i thought most of the people there were making fun of me . i could just see the guys in their pajamas having sex with their wives . it was not a very good movie at all .|0
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I am biased to the A&E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth.The characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believable.Darcy was portrayed tolerably well, I will grant him.|1
i ca n ' t knock this film too terribly , because it ' s obvious midway through the the watching of it that it has never been seen ( not even by an expert ) . for a long time afterwards , there is always a question as to which film was the best one to make at the end of the filming . the second film is about a boy and his grandmother in a town called bethlehem with a man they call ' george . ' what do these two men say to each other ? why did they have to live here when they were both so young ?|0
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.However in this American version I found it to be dull, Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore.|1
admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero ( bond ) and villain ( blofeld ) were quite unsuited to this work of art . james bond could be charming and funny , but he was still too much of a loser to have any real substance . even his character , if you can call it such , was not enough of an asset for the job . the most interesting thing about this movie was the way it went as a film , and what i saw in it - or rather , what i hoped i saw - was not anything good .|0
i never comment on a film , but i have to say that this was one of the worst films i ever watched . my brother is such an awful person . if he were n't such a horrible actor , he 'd be at home watching it for me with his older brothers and sisters . i mean , who wants to witness a movie with their two little brothers and sisters ? i am very disappointed in his character . i ca n't believe he could make something so ridiculous . why would he care about any of the others ?|0
... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.All others be warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.The film is good for some laughs though. Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie.2/10 for unintentional comedy.Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.|1
imagine every stereotypical , overacted cliche from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between 1930 and 1940 . the film is not only good , it is really great . if there was anyone who could say they had seen this film better , it would be this movie . i personally prefer to watch this movie rather than the script . the plot is a total failure and has no relevance whatsoever . the main point of this film is that nothing is ever explained to me , but i like to have an opinion . what do you find interesting in all this ?|0
i did not expect to enjoy this . in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew an old friend and the story is pretty good . so , i read it . there was nothing funny about it . it was all about high - school sweethearts and a few other people they met after graduation ( including my parents ) . at that point the story really started to make me laugh . i had just gotten back from a long drive and decided to check on my mom while i waited for my brother to come home .|0
The only reason i didn't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it...the only and i repeat the ONLY effect that they used is a weird kapoera (from India?) jump on a half meter wall/trash cans, i mean, effects doesn't make a movie but... sheesh.... me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used pharmacy's ..... and they found guns?!|1
( hr is what himesh is called in the movie , i think he likes it too . ) it takes a great deal of guts to actually talk to another person who may know about this movie . maybe i am acting like an old codger . maybe i want to kill someone , so i can get drunk and blow out all that pent up aggression . whatever . either way i should be getting off at any minute . i might as well have my money 's worth since i do n't even know what it is i am seeing .|0
without a doubt , the biggest waste of film of the year . this movie is poorly structured , sadistic , and utterly lame . what is wrong with it ? it takes three years to run a film that has so much negative character that it could become a masterpiece ! no , i 'm not saying this movie is ' bad ' , or even ' bad ' , it is just terrible . you are looking at half a billion people who can see a little more than they realize . i was there when the film was originally taken and saw one of the most dreadful scenes in the history of production ever .|0
this movie is an abortive , stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra - bad film out of them . i 'm just telling you that if you do have any real hope in finding a way to make it through the last three decades , you must try to find one that makes good movies , something that tells you how to fix what you 've lost and why . that 's the reason for this movie : we have all of the things that people who work hard on their image deserve to be happy .|0
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand.From the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre, a shark powers towards us, predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey. It is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes.Our ears on the other hand, are not given the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet.|1
i ' ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80 ' s . i found that there is a lot of dialogue and a lot of drama , most of which has nothing at all to do with actual crime or movie scenes . the reason why i chose this genre is because i thought it might be good for my mood . i felt very strongly about this film and had never heard of an original so i thought it would help my mood if i watched it one more time .|0
I generally LIKE Sion Sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. But sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. The plot makes only a whisper of sense. I think it was intended to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But the humor, such as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gory. I would say perhaps Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well.|1
Some sort of accolades must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline'. It's actually out Full-Mooned Full Moon. It bears all the marks of, say, your `Demonic Toys' or `Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish.|1
this movie really starts strong . we know that roberts is an atlanta hotshot sent to australia to fix coke production mistakes . he was a good guy but i do n't see him getting in trouble or doing anything wrong . i mean he tried , but it was too hard . there are times when i really feel bad for the guy . he is totally dedicated to his family and he spends most of his time at his house ; he never gets involved with people . what bothers me is that the movie is so stupid that nobody would want to play it .|0
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrayal.There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality.|1
i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad . this movie has terrible lines and no plot . i think you guys are doing great , but i did n't know this movie had any character . i never thought i would be so bored , i mean in my opinion this movie is like none of the others . i really do not want to live in new york at the moment . when i saw this movie it was just too good to pass up . i am glad that i went to the theater today instead of going to my room .|0
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. The movie opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed.|1
This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The ending is so much the better for being untidy.|1
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala ""Ocean's 11"", and pin it on the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated."|1
no really , im not kidding around here folks , and i so cant believe how many people here have seen movies like this . at the moment of the movie , a group of kids are running around in some kind of animal park and there is a very cute man trying to shoot a cat . as soon as the shot takes place , his face goes all red , but he manages to stay alive long enough to kill the cat . then the cats begin to chase him into the woods . when they find a cave where he can safely escape , they run off with him .|0
"This was a great movie. It had one ""sot-so-nice"" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot."|1
this is one of my favorite movies ever ! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust , this is near perfect . i hope that you have enjoyed this movie and are hoping for a chance to see it again once more before you leave town . in the last month i have been unable to find time to watch any of my favorite movies . this was actually quite nice . i really loved the story , although some of the characters were bad . there was something about them that got me through the next weeks , but i think the reason why did not come from their lack of interest in this film .|0
"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids!"|1
"This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care.This movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. It's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of ""men""."|1
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance I cannot bare. Junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father Ben madly insane. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior which is why I cannot tolerate this movie.|1
i did have some expectations from this film because 1 . it was a yash raj production 2 . when the story began , i knew the real story would not be great , and i just wanted to make sure that the whole thing was as good as it should be . if it were n't , of course there would have been a sequel ( which i am very confident that they would have ) . on the other hand , if it were one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life , i thought that i would have to watch something else with more than a little horror factor .|0
my expectations were high after seeing the trailer . they were even higher when i saw the movie had the new york yankees in it . however , since i do not want to get into a long list of stupid stereotypes and let you go on to some more stupid ones , i think that if there were people who could play this video game better then i ever could , i would have made a lot of money . the only thing that came back to me from the first two movies was the feeling that at least one of the most horrible things about this film was watching the characters be killed by aliens .|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (I'm hesitant to call ""Cimarron"" a ""film"", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it...mainly speaks against it.Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character--an overbearing and over-ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office."|1
Well, I fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but I literally just watched it- during a PBS membership drive- and frankly I'm too excited NOT to say anything. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety.|1
i see that c . thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor , but he and his partner are very good at pretending to be men . i do n't think it was a coincidence that we had this movie made when i was only 13 years old . you would think with all the money they were putting into this movie , it would have been worth watching . however , one of our friends is not only a bad actor , but has some extremely disturbing stories about how he is involved in illegal activities .|0
i ' m not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old tv show comes out . i ' m not like that . i just like seeing it as some kind of great idea to entertain the audience . if you want to see something that was done in 1991 , then you really don ' t deserve to watch it . this movie does nothing for me . what 's the point ? i don ' t know what this thing is about or why it ' s happening , but it ' s absolutely awful !|0
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of Richard Pryor.I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform.|1
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person. This movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. The dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. The chick of the movie is such a cliché.|1
I viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course,was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett.|1
this is the first porn i ' ve ever tried to review . it demands a different approach than usual , with some of the more controversial parts of the film taking longer to be released . when one has seen this movie in all its glory , we find it somewhat difficult to deal with the fact that these are the real ones . there are so many twists and turns from this movie , and i would like to thank the author who has written them all . what a great work of fiction ! please help me to enjoy the entire process .|0
as much as ' the beginning ' showed that we ' re still going to get ` ` classic ' ' x - files , drive - through ' films . and this is a good thing because when it ' s all said and done , nobody gets anything . the first part was totally dumb , which made it completely entertaining , but also quite amusing . there are a couple of things in the movie that make the story interesting . firstly , there are two guys that look really old . the first is about forty years old . the other guy looks about 20 years old .|0
this is a very good movie . i give it a 10 . it ' s very different in that it ' s kind of corny . i thought the premise would be pretty cool . well , not so funny . i watched the film but i can ' t recall anything about it on the first two or three movies . i was just guessing at the other ones . if you want to make fun of someone , say something about how they look , their personality , attitude , or attitudes , please ! this is one bad movie and it ' s totally messed up !|0
"the producers of this picture are hungarians . it ' s not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are making . in fact , the actors look like they ' ve gone off the deep end ( though i can still see some comedy here ) . for one thing , a couple of them have managed to become famous . two of these comedies do not seem to be as clever or as funny as they should have been . on the other hand , an average person would say "" how was your day ? "" - which is something people who don ' t know anything about tv show talk about ."|0
great 1980s comic strip comedy set in the south west of england . it is a tale of sex , violence and death with no plot other than what you see on the screen . it has been written as some sort of novel but it did not have a plot . if you enjoy this particular fantasy , please consider reading the screenplay . it would save you from making too much money for a career in hollywood . do i have your attention ? well , it 's not that bad . there are many good scenes in the genre and some of them are funny .|0
just saw this at the cinema . i have n ' t read the books . there is nothing new about this movie ; in fact , it has very little interesting content to say what it is or what it really means . i am not going to be bothered by many of these stupid movies . my opinion is that they will only get more boring as time goes on . most of the bad stuff starts when people try to find some cheap porn or other kind of p * * n ography that can give them a nice thrill .|0
this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other . henry may long is a great actor but he never actually plays his best because of his lack of confidence and his poor acting skills . as i told you , this film will have to do , for it 's a movie that requires a lot of action , and i personally find it highly annoying that the producers would waste so much time talking about the movie when it is just getting started on the television screen . there is no point in doing this any more than necessary to impress the people who should be impressed .|0
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in ""Beware, My Lovely,"" a 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on a Broadway play called ""The Man,"" Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home. She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on."|1
a genuinely creepy ghost story , full of chills and sensuality , this movie just falls short of what it is for me . i have to say that i have more than enough to go on ; i do not like the premise any more than you . there was nothing in this movie to attract my attention . i know that i could easily get a job here , but at this point i did not care if i got a job or not . it seemed like the best way to live was by playing along with the plot .|0
This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.The cast are good though, Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome A.J.|1
"i ' m sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn - fest somewhere , given enough time maybe the film should be shown again . as i said it was one of the best movies in hollywood ever made , not to mention a wonderful example of what i have come to believe to be the worst screenplay ever made . this movie ( and more ) has its own theme . we all know they were just bad , but when you look through an open copy of "" dead man "" you can see why ."|0
"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"", they are throwing various props around the room."|1
"By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive ""music"" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big ""surprises"" (which actually tend to be about as ""revelatory"" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience."|1
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder.|1
i am not familiar with the producer ' s other works , but this movie is a piece of crap . what do you expect to find in it ? it is nothing more than a silly script that no one actually knows how to edit . so let me try and explain something else - this film was a complete failure . the dialogue is lame ; the acting is unhelpful . if you had seen the movies when we were in grade school , you would understand why this movie was so pathetic . all the actors just seemed to think that their characters would be happy to sit through the scenes .|0
TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids.|1
this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while . it ' s not funny at all , just gross . i wanted to leave right then and there , but as soon as i sat down , i knew i needed to get away from the movie , or else they were going to kill me for sure . i watched about thirty minutes before i realized that if i didn ' t stop this movie , i was going to die . so i had to sit through a half an hour of it before i even thought about staying in the room .|0
this movie was so bad it looked like a home movie . in one scene , the camera very slowly turned away from them . the next shot was worse . it was a bunch of teens laughing and pointing at the camera . they were trying to take pictures of each other . when the kid tried to take some shots of him , he fell down . the crowd cheered for the poor kid . i could feel my eyes getting teary and i knew if i laughed too much , i would n't be able to stop myself .|0
"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves (""You loved her?""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner."|1
yes , indeed we have a winner - a winner in best dumb - action - movie ! the only reason i chose to vote for this one was so i would n't have to see this show . as soon as i saw the movie and read the comments on the television screen , i immediately knew there could n't be that many other comedians involved . i had been trying to figure out what the plot was but i ca n't say i liked it . i really like the comedy and i thought it would get me out of my rut . the story was just boring .|0
Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. It features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though.|1
"mr . baseball is a film of paradoxes . written and filmed as a ` ` light , sports comedy ' ' the stars ' ( not to mention all of them ) , i have read numerous stories in which they ' went down ' . most of these are comedic but some are real . this one is an old - school "" bad joke "" that ' s so bad that it looks like it ' s meant to be funny . the worst part was that the plot could never be made into a decent movie ."|0
it is sad that some find this film worth watching . i am russian , and i am disgusted . my mother would kill me for this . no one cares about movies . nothing makes sense . even the plot is just so stupid . we have to use the script as an example . i got into an argument with my aunt when i was in high school . she asked me what i wanted to study . i did not know what she meant , so i told her i wanted to study russian and i could not think of a better reason than to go to school here .|0
terror in the jungle is a real find . if you saw it , you ' re one of the few people on earth i have not seen dead ! so when this film comes out and all its characters get murdered , it will be a very good show . i ' m sure the first person that sees it will either believe it was really staged or turn away from it . i don ' t mind watching this movie . i know many people who do not want to see this but i can ' t just stand by and watch it any longer .|0
Wow -- this movie was really bad! You talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie.|1
age of steel follows up the previous episode , rise of the cybermen , which was excellent in some respects until a couple of months ago . i hope it does not take you long to figure this thing out - i think it has made a good first impression . i really enjoyed the movie and i thought it was pretty cool . but as you can see , i was disappointed when the characters became clones . there is one other similarity to the others . while we do not all agree that they have similar characteristics , we disagree on the extent and depth of their capabilities .|0
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable."|1
i recently saw episodes 1 - 4 , and now i ca n ' t wait for 5 & 6 to be available ! ! ! i hope you enjoyed this series as much as the first time . i love the suspense thrillers ; i can still see it in my mind whenever i have a moment to think about what i saw last night when i was on the set . the plot was very different from the other two movies i have watched , but they both seemed to make sense . the script and characters were like that of every film i ever saw .|0
the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months . the plot of the story was uninteresting , not like any movie i had seen in my life , but i did hear that it was bad and very well made . i could not wait for the next installment to be written and watched by the two other people whom i knew were on the tv . unfortunately , many of the characters came from poor backgrounds , which is an understatement . this is nothing short of awful . how do you know a good movie is bad ? are you even trying ?|0
the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then - husband - wife team of robert wagner and natalie mcmillian . i had seen this movie plenty of times on my television shows in college , but i had never actually heard of it , so i did not know if it was one of the worst flicks i had ever seen in my life . it has to be one of the worst , but at least it does n't look like they were really trying to have a sex life . that makes me want to scream in disgust .|0
irwin allen put all his talents behind this one : he ' s co - screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish movie that ' s about to take the form of an entire tv audience . is this a bad time ? do i have too much to worry about ? there can be only so much fun you can watch in a movie like this one . i ' m not really into watching movies as a way of doing my job or making myself feel more comfortable . i prefer thrillers that portray real life situations where people are being murdered and then they just go ahead and film the movie on their own .|0
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. One definite plus is how it was filmed. Set in Morrocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion is filled with stirring images like the Great Raisuli on horseback especially. The cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal.|1
"""Tumbling Doll of Flesh"" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.Typically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.There is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.The special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.Her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."|1
mute witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserved . i loved the first few pages of this tale , but not as much as the movie . the plot and characters are too predictable , and the story is just too hard to follow . there was a bit of a horror scene on the soundtrack , but i could n't enjoy it . so i gave up . in the end i decided to let the movie play its own game , which was to watch it live .|0
what we know of caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and had no clue that she was about to die . in reality , she was simply playing her part like every other prostitute on the east side . the only thing that really shocked me when i met them was that they didn ' t try hard at all to get any work done . some of the things that they said seemed to have an awful lot to say about who they were and how they could do what they did and yet still be considered professionals .|0
you have to like baseball , and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck , but if you do like baseball you will not be into it . the only thing that is really exciting about the season is the way everyone seems to act as though they think it has something to do with them . i was watching the braves play this season and could understand why anyone would want to win a baseball game . there are things that most guys hate about baseball in the first half of the season because they can never find anything on tv that is so interesting .|0
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist.Some one at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.A few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks so much, Sci-Fi!|1
at the story. It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in New England. Her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road.|1
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice.|1
This film was great!Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off.Tasha Smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear Grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.And Oh,I can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.Damn!|1
Now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz.|1
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long time friend and confidant.Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it.|1
"it ' s one of the imponderables of low - budget independent film - making that so many with so little in the way of imagination can produce . even if you have enough credits to make it , you would never be able to follow through on this project . there ' s no reason not to go ahead and take some of your best shot . 
 "" this is something i ' m particularly interested in , "" mark continues as i look at my camera for a few moments . i feel a sense of dread about seeing this ."|0
"I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like ""Boston Legal"" or ""Ally McBeal"" or even ""LA Law."" This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt, like the ""Chewbacca defense"" on South Park.) This is a real travesty of justice, the legal system gone horribly wrong, and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype, who use all of their skills to right it."|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.|1
"Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it this past weekend, and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better...it didn't...The picture quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting itself was cheesy, but I guess it's acceptable for ""yet another"" teenage horror flick."|1
i did n ' t hate this one . i just could n ' t adapt to the story . it did n ' t really take me long to see how my opinion of this movie would be judged . a lot of the good things about this movie are the way it is directed , the dialogue and dialog , the plot . however , if you don ' t feel that the characters are trying too hard ( which they most definitely are not ) , then why don ' t you think about moving up to the next stage in this movie ?|0
"I can just picture how this movie came to be:""So how else can we screw up our careers?"" ""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place!"|1
it is n ' t too bad , but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has . the jokes are few and far between . i think it 's one of the most entertaining movies i 've ever seen . i wish i was in it . when i finally left my room this afternoon i had to make a decision about which film to take on . first off i would have like a new movie set , or at least an action flick where i can get some action . then i 'd like a more modern story - ending with a little romance .|0
"This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, ""Rolling Kansas"" is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie."|1
acting 10 , script 1 . ` ` hurlyburly ' ' is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared it the best film to have on show since 1930 ! i thought you knew how to play with your words , as did a dozen of your fellow actors . they are not even really there , and we do not see them here for much of their roles . what makes these things so bad ? when this movie first started , it was quite good . it went by far better than i had ever seen before . in any case , it was totally uninspiring .|0
"Yet another in the long line of ""Don't"" films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be."|1
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed.|1
If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished!|1
as a parent of two girls ( 14 and 11 ) i have grave doubts about this show and all its content but , what does it matter ? it is in the name of my dead father and he is still alive . so , how do you know anything about this crap ? ! ? are you making me mad or am i getting used to this show ? ! ! ? ! ! i want nothing more in this world right now than to go home and put this show on the front page of any newspaper in the world .|0
I'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. This movie is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made.|1
"Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken, of ""TheWitches of Eastwick"" and the Addams family movies."|1
well , i have to agree with the critics on this one , who all said ` ` leave it alone . ' but that just is n't true . no way could they have found out how far along i am . there is absolutely nothing wrong with what you do . if there is something wrong , you are supposed to help it . if there is something wrong , you 're supposed to make sure it happens . maybe i should have thought of that . and i would like to point out that it has never been proven to me in a courtroom that the judges were not being truthful about their positions .|0
"Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterion's ""Monsters & Madmen"" set), director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!"|1
i ca n ' t believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic . i ' m a million miles from having that kind of talent at my age , especially if i ' ve been up there for about two weeks . i have to say i am not too proud of how i was raised by such people . i spent most of my childhood listening to them ramble on and on about how great their movies are and how awesome they are . i always had to tell them it was n't really bad .|0
i ' ve seen a few bad action movies in my days , but this one ' s just plain awful . i ' m really sorry that you went through such a terrible time and there ' s an awful lot of good people in this movie and they ' ve all gone to horrible extremes to save each other . no - one has ever been so evil in their lives as they are here in this story ! i could have put the book down at any time and done something about it . however , what i do can only hope is that somebody will come back for it sometime .|0
ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist . it was one of my worst cases as a child and i had to watch it often enough . the only good parts , however , were those which you can not tell from this movie : there is this really horrible guy who falls off a cliff and smashes his skull against an enormous boulder . then there is this woman who just gets her life back together again and lives with her husband - although he never did give her any money !|0
"The horrific production doesn't qualify as a ""film."" It was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! There is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a ZERO!The plot is contrived and ridiculous. A late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? PLEASE!"|1
Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her.|1
"SPOILER WARNINGWe've all heard the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school."|1
I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience!|1
i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80 ' s . at first it sounded like a great idea , but after what we were seeing today , i was pretty sure it was a total waste of bullets . you never see such an awesome horror film as the one i was watching that day . there is something so frightening and terrifying about it . even though i was sitting down for lunch , i got lost trying to find the nearest tv station to watch it . my mom said that she could show me some videos later , but until then i had no idea which channel i should watch .|0
this was by far one of the worst movies sandra bullock has starred in . ben affleck should stay behind , not just so he can get into trouble at the next big movie festival . but that 's just too bad because i am really enjoying it . i do n't care about the plot , it is a real piece of shit and i want to watch it from its start . i like the whole idea of having a movie as long as there are a bunch of dumb kids hanging out with their parents . what a joke .|0
this is by far my favorite action movie . but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin comedy , which you have seen - that i am very grateful for . while i do enjoy movies such as those in this genre , the story is not much better . at first the plot was fairly simple . the characters are quite predictable and they seem to be able to relate to the world of the film without actually interacting with it . each time i watch this scene , it seems like there is something about this character that has me intrigued .|0
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so I thought I would take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years.Better than I expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighting men and women.|1
you know sometimes you just got ta have it ? that ' s how this movie is with me . i watched it when i was in high school and it was great for the first few years of my life . then after a while , i had to get out of my apartment . i thought i would enjoy the film at the time , but i did not . all i could think about was taking a walk down by the river . i remember thinking how strange it was to hear water lapping against the riverbank .|0
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true."|1
"I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur. Her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to ""get away"" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny."|1
i ' m surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie . even my 4 and 6 year old sister could hardly write it down ! i thought that was one of the bad things that happened when i was born in 1976 . a lot of good times came from this film for me . i saw the whole thing , and so does my little brother paul who lives in california with his mother . no big surprise there though . if you want to see anything about this movie , please sign up at the site of https : // www.smashwords.com / books / view / 2768524 .|0
my parents may enjoy this show , but i fail to find the humor in it . what is so damn funny ? how could i have been that stupid as to believe all this was going to be a movie or a series of movies - and there were lots of movies . it just does not seem fair . even if the plot is not bad , the audience is not very interesting and the content is much too depressing for me to like . on the other hand , you know the ending of this movie ; they are all dead . why should this be any different ?|0
reba is a very dumb show . you can predict pretty much anything that ' s about to happen . barbra streisand , the actress i saw at the cast party , was a great looking young woman ( it 's not too hard to think that she ' s the queen of england ) . as soon as i saw how far along she really was , i knew something huge was coming . if we ' re going to live in this world , we need to keep a close eye on all of the bad stuff and watch for the best ones .|0
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it!|1
"Nothing about this movie is any good. It's a formulaic predictable ""romantic comedy"" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. In other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors."|1
"I realize most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience. But then why bother to call it ""Solomon Kane"" in the first place when the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. That's where the resemblance ends.It's always a bad sign when any superhero/fantasy/sci-fi movie lingers over an origin story, but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all, you've already missed the point completely."|1
"""Hey, I didn't order no cab!"" ""Yeah, well you got one..."" What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America's TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode."|1
"having enjoyed koyaanisqatsi and powaqatsi i was looking forward to this third part of the qatsi trilogy and seeing what it looks like , i guess you would call it "" fun "" . i have read a lot of horror books over the years as well as some new thrillers . also , it has been a long time since i saw one of those movies . it is really scary and i can hardly believe that all this happened . for instance , there was a woman who was attacked while she was driving home from a party and had to be pulled out of the car by the local cop ."|0
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.Normally I don't write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer.|1
i do n ' t care what anyone else says , this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film . when you see it , they are so horrible that it makes you want to crawl into a hole and die . not only am i going to be stuck in this miserable place for the next 2 hours , i can barely eat . now look at the screen . there are two people staring at each other , acting like they might have known each other for years . then they turn around and go back into the cabin and close the curtains . wow .|0
It is sad that some find this film worth watching. I am Russian, and I am disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive directorial work.|1
kazuo komizu strikes again with ` ` entrails of a beautiful woman ' ' , the sequel to ` ` entrails of a beautiful woman ' -- this is called the original story . in other words , you should see this new one . on the back of that book , written in russian - japanese characters , were pictures of people i 'd never seen before . i was so caught up in it i had forgotten all about this movie and the plot . the only thing i could be certain of at the outset was that it involved a man who looks very much like ivan hemingway .|0
High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels(Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of.|1
This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. The special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. It is a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart.|1
I went to this film having no idea what to expect. I actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.I only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There's A LOT of subtle humor.Here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: A big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society.|1
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc.|1
Another first: this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Perhaps I'm a bit hasty when I say that this is probably my last Rohmer movie but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought was never going to end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. He struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air.|1
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards).|1
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch , its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining . i really liked the original movie , but could not figure out what made it make me dislike it . all of the characters have a big difference in their personalities from the ones that i am familiar with , which does not surprise me much . the director was good - looking and seemed to be very friendly . there was one character who was just as tough as the rest . he took advantage of the obvious flaws in the movie and started acting out his own scenes .|0
One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.|1
totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack : i ' d give it ( soundtrack ) a 9 out of 10 minutes or 20 seconds to live . this is my favorite film , although i was really hoping that it wouldn ' t start until the end . when the credits begin to come on screen i almost scream with pleasure . as i sit here watching this , i think how funny it would be for someone who has seen many horror films and has been subjected to many movies . at the time , i just assumed it was all some kind of lame attempt at humor to get my attention .|0
Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator Bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film. That said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance.|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery.|1
this movie is all about reality , submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science . there were no explosions , no explosions at all ( except for the fact that they went off when i had to run for my life ) . actually , most people thought it was some kind of joke . but really , who does n't ? you could put one up with the first time i saw this movie . anyway , as i have explained over the past few months , the movie ' s plot and characters appear to be genuine .|0
a cbs radio program entitled ` ` we the people ' ' assists in finding an american home for vienna refugee charles wagner ' . the story is very old - fashioned ; it may be quite different from the current one and it must have been thoroughly edited ( as i see it ) to make it seem authentic . the whole situation is ridiculous , the only good parts of it having been made by me is the fact that it 's about to become a horror movie but which is pretty close to being just another waste of time .|0
unless there ' s some huge ironic conspiracy going on , my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this book . in fact , the entire movie was hilarious . i mean , not like this movie where everything is a big joke , but almost exactly like this movie . the theme seemed to make it all worthwhile . what i would n't give to see this movie ! i really enjoyed this show and it showed the same thing every week . that ' s how you ' re supposed to feel during a bad episode .|0
i ' m a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 ' s subgenres . name one i ' ve seen but this one is great . i could not believe what i saw when it first appeared . in all my travels there has never been an event where so many of the actors have been captured without being executed . i just thought they were stupid and probably would have been taken off at a later time , but this film was so much more exciting than i anticipated . it actually did have some interesting stuff going on , but overall it was really very boring to watch .|0
This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim.|1
writer - director dean bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film . his dialogue was not what i imagined it to be , and at the same time there was a lot more to it than i realized . the characters were all very believable , they all seemed well mannered , and most importantly they had a good head for acting . this is the real thing . however , as we progress into the final scene in the series , i am getting tired of being treated like an idiot . instead of having a great laugh at the end , i 'm starting to get really irritated .|0
"Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is ""nott"" very good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. As I hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is ""nott"" even worth the bandwidth.Up until the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills."|1
Excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually.|1
flesh feast starts at miami airport , ace reporter dan carter ( harry kerwin , he is also credited as one of the best ever ) leads his readers to believe there were some really bad people in the united states , but he could have made a joke of it , or maybe he just did not care . either way , he got the impression that the whole ordeal had taken about five minutes because he had so many questions for them . even though he was young and had been in high school , he thought he would be good with the rest of the audience .|0
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral.|1
"This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. ""The Stupids"" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great.In order to appreciate ""The Stupids"", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: ""I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime."""|1
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review . unfortunately , both times i have been moved so fast it was all just a blur . i have spent many hours editing the story and doing some research on my e - reader to find out more about what they were talking about in the main characters of this work . for instance : how do you really get a good copy ? where did it originate ? that 's another thing i am not interested in . the entire movie revolves around the same person - the one who has taken the lead ; the one who gets killed .|0
the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s . ephata merkerson . ms . merkerson . as you read this , i believe you would agree with us that this was a bad move on our part , and not an easy one on the audience . so , why do n't we give it another go ? well , if you were to look at this article , you would understand why i thought the plot was extremely funny . this film is a very unoriginal portrayal of the life of don nadie ( who has a passion for crime in his career as a lawyer ) .|0
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice-over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and I didn't quite understand. The movie is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie specifies). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans, and enters into a battle with the bikers.|1
"For the record, I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. I think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the ""geniuses"" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and MEET THE SPARTANS.I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies."|1
back in august , ' 81 there was a country - ish buzz to movies , big hits like ` ` urban cowboy ' ' and ' cowboys of the desert ' . what 's more , i saw the same films before i saw them . it took me two hours to finish the first movie that i ever saw , because i did not want to watch any other movie as an adult , but i did enjoy watching this film . i just could not bear to watch it when i was a kid , so i had to watch it later .|0
"Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and ""gritty downtown"" from a suburban perspective.The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola$, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men At Work, The Flirts and Bananarama.This movie truly is Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's Los Angeles."|1
"as much as i respect firefighters for what they do . i was unimpressed and bored with this film . all i could see was that there was a lot of movement in the dark and the lighting did n't make any sense to me . it looked like the movie was supposed to be scary but instead it seemed like it was kind of amusing . at least when i watched it i knew how to play the game . well , i guess i should try and get a feel for this movie ( or "" game "" as some critics call it ) ."|0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat.|1
"So many of us who are devoted to the ""art"" of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. Once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this."|1
this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 ' s exploitation film , except it was done in one of those old westerns where you know what it is and do not even have to look around to find out . i think i could see why people hate the movie , because it is so bad , but let 's be honest about these things . there are some parts that actually work , but the other stuff comes from the top down . for instance , a couple of months ago when we came back from the airport i felt like someone had shoved a hot poker into my heart .|0
"""Cat In The Brain"" is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director Lucio Fulci's most notorious years of film-making. The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than that, he casts himself as the star, the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. ""Cat in The Brain"" is not about presenting a clear story and following it."|1
dante would of been mortified , if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets ! ! ! i know that some critics think this movie is a bit much but the story is amazing . there were so many scenes where the actors looked like animals ( although they may have been real animals ) , and they were probably made in the ' 70s or early 2000s . the first time i took this book i was very impressed by the story itself . it was a lot like the other books that had been released in 1980 .|0
San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother?|1
from the beginning of this film , with it ' s ` ` the lost boys ' ' rip off opening sequence , i had been watching this movie for about three months . i thought it would be cool to watch it on tv but it turned out to be a total waste of money ! there is nothing like having to spend five hours at the end of the film to get you into trouble . by the way , this film is hilarious and even though i am not looking forward to the scene , i must say that it was rather good .|0
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose, one may ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.It starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only till the heroine forces herself upon them. Not once but twice.|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. It´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.|1
mr bean was great fun , i loved it , every episode was really funny , rowan atkinson was perfect and he actually won a few awards , and the funniest part was when he gave me this big box that i had n't seen yet . i just kept thinking ' why did he have to give up so much for us ? ' and i kept thinking : ' what a loser . ' i ca n't believe how many times michael made it his mission to tell me about his life . but even then i wanted to go down there and read the film .|0
what is night vision ? well according to the star ( williamson ) let ' s see . . . one package store was a disaster . two people got killed in the explosion . an elderly lady and a baby were not found until later in the evening . the fire department was sent to investigate the scene for any other reason . they never came out alive . the story is pretty lame too . if i ever see this movie again , i will buy a magazine about that time . but at least it might be a good idea to get some more reading material from this book .|0
there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar . its so nice to see this wonderful movie on the screen - i could not wait to watch it for a long time . the director and his sidekick are very pleasant and have good acting ability , but they are not very funny at all . the plot is totally uninteresting , even though i did not know what comedy had ever come from that movie . the first part of this film seemed to be directed by an american actor who looks nothing like kevin mcguire ( who is probably still alive and breathing somewhere ) .|0
the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover , but we ' ve discovered it was a picture in which she is being mauled by an ogre and he ' s fighting for her . of course , i ' ve been watching this program many times and have come to believe that it really isn ' t funny . as one of the main characters in the show , the film has such a wonderful sense of humour , you would not believe how funny it actually is . after viewing the episode , i can hardly believe it . i just don ' t think this is fair !|0
It's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(Anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), Anderson's unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell......That's why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much. Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days.|1
"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...The strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a real treat."|1
i have always loved bad creations , rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college . this one does not even need to be made up . it is as good a work as any from the ' 80s . the title of this movie makes me wish i could turn the television off . when i was a little kid i often thought about having a tv like this . what am i supposed to say to people who ask me why i love bad movies ? if you want to get your act together you should start acting .|0
"Of all the movies in the history of movies I can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called ""Breeders."" Lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of ""It Came from Outer Space"" instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds?"|1
Oh what the heck, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!Yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks!If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does.|1
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn.|1
"First off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said ""well, mistakes happen"" and brushed it off. After about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.Now, about the film."|1
certain aspects of punishment park are less than perfect , specifically some of the acting . however i feel that there is little value to it as one of the best shows in the whole series has been destroyed by a couple of amateur actors . at this point in the show there would be a great deal more ' fun ' if it had actually been about any of them . for starters , the movie was not meant for anyone who could write anything but a bunch of numbers and scenes . instead it was an all - out disaster from start to finish .|0
Steven Segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is being executed because he stole some money? Some Mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court Justice? Their goal is to exchange the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money?|1
"yes it is your typical direct to video action flick . and of course they do their best to change everything . the fact that this movie was a total disappointment should have been a relief , but alas , it was not . in fact , it gave me no pleasure . 
 "" what ? "" i said . i felt like a complete moron at first . then i remembered my name and started to laugh . i looked around the room and could n't find anyone with a funny bone in their body . 
 "" oh , right ."|0
First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!? !If any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it.|1
Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise!!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy.|1
the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played such a bad role in it ? if he had just done his part , it would n't have bothered me so badly . i mean there was a lot of stuff to do , lots of people doing things they should be doing , but the first thing we saw on the main screen was the two of them falling head over heels together . i ca n't say it was very nice to watch that movie , but i can say it was great fun .|0
"Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.Basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's ""Real Genius"", with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself."|1
"Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports ""it takes a village to raise a child"" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress."|1
"Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonize Venice. Idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. It is, absolutely, a"" memento mori"". and a exploration of illusion. A old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. ""Death"" is a Orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality."|1
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film isn't anywhere near as funny.|1
who does n ' t love the muppets ? ! impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm - up , but they are very good with other things and i do not think that a movie like this is particularly bad . it seems as if the director is simply trying to make his own movies , although there is really nothing wrong with one of those films . anyway , it was my first time watching it , and all i wanted was to leave town . i actually did get in more trouble for it being stupid .|0
"Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there's ANOTHER murder...so it's someone in that room.What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before ""Dracula"") who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector."|1
i concur with the other users comment . hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it was originally made in 2008 and is still being played at any given date . it is so easy to fall asleep after watching a bad movie . if there is one thing that you have to get used to when you go to college , it seems to be that all movies are either cheap or awful . how did this movie come out in 2005 ? i asked myself that question almost two hours before the episode started .|0
this movie is an obvious rip - off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson . you owe it to yourself to invest more time and energy into this film than you do on the production itself . this movie does not end with a bullet in its head . that movie would have made my life difficult had it not been from the beginning . the plot , like the film , was very similar to what i liked . there is also a sense of evil about the entire thing , especially the parts about the guy who dies in his truck accident .|0
let ' s get things straight . i was raised catholic , and in a very religious family , and spent some of those years thinking that i would someday be married and have my own church . but there is no getting around the fact that if you do n't pray for forgiveness , you may end up spending the entire day watching tv , or listening to infomercial commercials , or just waiting for god to appear and save you from hell . after an hour of watching this stupid old movie , i realized that it had nothing to do with life .|0
before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema . ( 1 ) your average horror movie with a slightly different genre is actually quite entertaining . you never knew when the actors would try to make their film sound funny , just as you never knew when the actors would use it for good reason . movies such as these usually are not worth seeing . however they are pretty good . i was going to see an old movie in my spare time , but now i had to wait and watch this .|0
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen. On a par with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. Then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something.|1
First the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, You've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed on just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, Would somebody tell Shirley she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it...if there's no reruns of Andy Griffith on.|1
next stop on our journey through the calender - slasher scene is . . . oh yes , ` ` graduation day ' ' ! all in all we were a sad bunch . it was so exciting to watch that i was not even thinking about anything else but getting into this film . i really loved the movie and thought there had to be one of my worst parts yet . when i came upon this movie i thought i would vomit in my mouth . there she is sitting alone in the sand , her hands folded over her chest , looking like a girl with no clue how to handle a camera .|0
on the positive , i ' ll say it ' s pretty enough to be watchable . on the negative , it ' s nothing more than a short piece of crap story . this is my first and only taste of horror so i don ' t know what to think . the film was just a bunch of boring characters with unrealistic ideas , who could ' t even understand why they were being directed by someone in a movie . this was not the sort of film where one protagonist had a bad plot line ; this was some kind of comedy .|0
although embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics , it degenerates into a stereotypical frankenstein parable that does not give an entirely objective basis for a narrative . there is one good thing to come from this book - the premise can be put together perfectly as it should . if anyone asks , do you ever go to bed with a woman and then start having feelings for her ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ? ? ? when i was a kid , my mom would say yes in a flash , so long as she got some of the money .|0
the setup for ` ` nature of the beast ' ' is ingeniously simple , and fraught with limitless potential for suspense . the movie was designed to make a person feel isolated from his neighbors , but there 's something else about it that makes this movie very much like any other . if you look hard enough , you can still see a lot more than what you just saw . when you look carefully , you can see that some parts of the action are somewhat amateurish ; they should be more accurate than others , so they are probably not good .|0
"Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word ""visionary"" in them. Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them."|1
This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal, where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives.|1
'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. Alas, as I watched it alone, and so I felt like I almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'Thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries.|1
i have so much hope for the sequel to gen - x . luckily , my hopes have came true . you will find many reviews from people like this and other indie authors . if you liked gen - x you will find others like this as well . if there was an original author in this book it would certainly be gendered and a great example to the characters of this series . some of the story is really funny ; some of the bad parts are comical . however , one of the worst parts of this trilogy is just how bad it all sounds !|0
"ok , well , no one in their right mind ( s ) would pick up a movie titled ` ` the big bang ' . "" i don ' t know what he saw in there , but it doesn ' t make any difference . it was not an exciting film and it certainly didn ' t get the people to talk about anything useful . the only memorable fact that got to me about the whole episode was the fact that my ex - fiancée was very popular with some of her closest friends . why did she suddenly decide to switch sides ?"|0
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.I'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin.|1
this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen . when i watched the manga review in 2009 , i actually believed it to be true . the premise was pretty good and they made it all sound like science fiction ! so why could n't i see that movie ? what did i get myself into ? as far as i can recall , nobody else on the film was doing anything wrong . i was very impressed with their choice of actors for the movie . i do not know how many times i have played this film before .|0
"You know sometimes you just gotta have it? That's how this movie is with me. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but I find myself reaching for it when I'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, I am just not a ""goofy movie"" kinda guy.You can read the synopsis so I don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like Kelsey Grammer you will probably like this movie.One more thing, be SURE to watch the end credits."|1
"Hello again, I have been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. You forget it is the bugs relating to one another. It was just as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such beautiful color in this movie.I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, that I just can't remember the ""why"" of it.Thanks for listening."|1
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. He also thinks he's a chicken.Sounds bizarre right? Well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on.The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck.|1
i would like to know if ` ` the outsiders ' ' ( australian tv series ) will ever be released on a new channel , and if not you can come back with other shows . the main reason i am considering this movie is that most movies do not have any of their own special effects . i have to say that it all seems to be going well at first , but then it suddenly goes wrong . the film appears to be quite boring . when you watch it for about three hours , you think you can just wait it out and still enjoy it as it plays out .|0
"one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which has n ' t been given the credit it deserves . i can understand how you would wish for more of an experience , but do not waste time getting your hopes up about something that may never be . what we have seen are some very bad comedians and movie makers who have played a good role in trying to make themselves feel better . as far as the fact that the production is so bad , i have never heard of such a performance . let 's start with the big ones . """|0
"now here is a movie that does something that has n ' t been done in a long time . it take about an hour to watch , and then i had to sit back for most of this thing . this is the greatest movie ever built , or ever will be created . it really takes up more time than i can spend with movies like this . there is so many things wrong with this picture . i just want my life back ! it seems as if when the actors put their heads on the floor and start screaming "" no "" you do n't hear anything at first ."|0
I don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot.|1
well , i ' ve watched this movie for over 25 years now and it ' s still almost as interesting as the characters . i suppose if you watch it in a cinema like this they don ' t really see the big picture or care who knows about it . my favourite part is the one where the narrator gets a real good look at the actors and decides they are not bad - looking , but more than just a bit arrogant . this film had a character that he did not recognize , an artist that didn ' t like what she saw ( which was pretty much nothing ) .|0
as a kid , this movie scared me green . as an adult , i could n ' t stop laughing . i have seen it a billion times ( almost ) but i can still remember the characters in this movie . they look exactly alike to me , with their long blonde hair and skin . they were all cute and seemed harmless . at first i did not like them for real , but then i got used to seeing them around . one time when i was little i thought they were good looking people , but they were really bad looking kids .|0
after some quite ok dutch action flicks , like lek and van god los , gerrard verhage wants to make the best of his life by playing a role in one . he has a great deal of fame and fortune as a character that does n't take too much notice of anything other than what is going on around him . i never saw any of them in action , so i figured this movie would be pretty bad . it 's a very sad and depressing movie , with all sorts of comedies being performed . if you really love someone , you have to watch them .|0
"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior."|1
"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster."|1
earth final conflict began like a new world , a new vision from the creator of star trek , something that made no sense at all until i read this and it came into being . you might not realize it , but this is how it is . first of all , when you think about one movie where an entire race of aliens was created from nothing and lived around the stars , there are people in the story trying to be intelligent with technology and technology . some have been doing this since the beginning of time as well . these people are looking for another way to become intelligent .|0
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain though, because (unless you've seen this) I bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (That's the original part-not good or bad, just there)! Let me say that I have seen every comedian appearing in a main role, and like them all. That's what makes this such a mystery. The supporting leads are actually acting (although the dialog is bad). The only character that is fairly good is the one played by John Goodman.|1
"""No one really knows how the Power came to be. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted The families of Ipswich formed a Covenant of Silence bla bla bla"" After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't."|1
i walked into blockbuster , itchin ' to watch some good old fashion action movies . so i browsed around the internet and found something to read . a great book ! i was so impressed by how fast it was turning out that i did not see the sequel for my own enjoyment . as i sat through the first part i felt that i had made a tremendous difference . there is little doubt that there is a great movie on the line . i do n't understand how anyone could ever imagine that anything would be so bad . it is actually pretty funny .|0
"Throughout watching ""End of Days"", I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see ""Se7en"") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us."|1
although i watched this film by myself ( thankfully ) , i still felt embarrassed while watching it . i ca n't get over how difficult the whole thing was . i thought it would make things a lot easier with my dad but he ' s an idiot . all you can do is wait and pray for some miracle or other . if there was one thing i believed in now it ' s having to watch it on dvd . every time i ' ll be disappointed to see what turns out to be a movie .|0
relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match ( mahler ' s 5th is gorgeous , but listen here , you just watch ! . ) in the midst of it all , on top of it all , a beautiful young man - whose name i have never met - shows up . he is very handsome and has one hell of a movie star look . . . well , let me tell you , even if he does act that way , there would be so much more money in it than what you get by paying an actress to set up for him as a friend .|0
I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat.|1
this is a must - see movie . you will laugh , you will cry , and when it ' s over you will feel guilty . there are many reasons to hate movies , but they are not the worst ones . i have seen too many scary movies of the genre in the past to ever want to watch an old bad sitcom that has been made by amateurs . what i love about this one is the way it plays on the screen at all times . the actors always seem to know exactly how to perform , and why .|0
the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism - style of animation and a hint of mystery - not to say that it was n't interesting . when you go to look at a film , you just know there has to be something special about it . i could have spent hours looking at this movie if i wanted to see anything really interesting . however , since i got to watch it , i saw no reason why i should want to do anything but watch the movie instead . after all , i am a nerd .|0
"I loved so much last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece ""L'Ora di Religione"". It had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say Castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!)."|1
Okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. So, does he ask his father for the dough? Nope, he STEALS IT and gets caught. Kids, if I'm ever turned invisible, I'll advance your allowance, ok?|1
I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing.|1
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as supposed washed up beach stud Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of LA on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman.|1
"I just found out before writing this review that ""Komodo vs. Cobra"" and another movie called ""Curse of the Komodo"" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. That might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. They both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. What differences are there?"|1
after being off the air for a while , columbo returned with some new made - for - tv mysteries that , while not as entertaining as he might have expected , were interesting to watch . he was especially interested in these old slapstick movies when he learned that the movie was actually very good about a guy who has lost his job and is living in a small town . i remember the film well but i could only see the parts of it that were good and the other parts did not give me much insight into the story at all .|0
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came.|1
the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics . while the theme seems common , the story is based on all the events in the past few decades . the movie starts out as a short one - sided affair , where the protagonist turns around and tells his or her heroine to go find somewhere else to have fun . when the heroine decides that it is not having fun enough , she does what most girls would do , walks away , and goes home . from there she heads to new orleans and gets herself knocked up by a crazy old guy who finds her sexy .|0
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We'd 100% recommend it, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen, and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did.The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast.|1
"This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the ""gray"" characters turn ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.Which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place."|1
For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out.|1
This movie totally sucked!!! Don't even rent it! You'll hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins cant fly! Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. I am not who you think I am!|1
the movie is nothing extraordinary . as a matter of fact , it is an insult to the horror genre . this movie is absolutely atrocious . i found out the author has been doing drugs for 20 years so he has some serious issues that are very similar to his own kind . well , it just so happens there is a lot more money involved in these kinds of movies than the real thing . unfortunately , when i heard what was being filmed on the local news i came to the conclusion that i had never seen such pornographic acts before .|0
okay , so this series kind of takes the route of ' here we go again ! ' week in , month out , and that ' let me tell you what happened . for instance , i was talking with a local kid about school and then i started talking to a teenage girl about where she lived and what she had to do during her free time after school . there were a couple of things wrong with this movie though , as well as the way it was done . i can only point out some of the parts which were wrong , like the plot .|0
i agree with msinabottle ; this is a great movie . here are some dialogue snippets : raisuli ( sean crocker ) has no idea why it is being directed by the same guy that was trying to kill him last month . he gets a call and turns off his cell - phone when he 's at work . there is a good reason why it could not have been produced in a better theater . i have to admit , this movie may be the first film to make its own reality tv show , but all i can say for certain is that the character is utterly lacking in any other means of action .|0
the series does not start as it means to go on . although it ' s first two seasons are crammed with all manner of nonsense , i thought that this would be an interesting read , so i wrote it in my head . you know the rest . i don ' t have much to compare it to because it ' s been about five months since i won ' t see the same guy twice . this was actually fairly easy for me and i did a lot of reading before i went to sleep . i love this movie !|0
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late?While not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this film was created) HOPPITY is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality.|1
"This is a semi fictional memoir of an ""international man"" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.I was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However, I was disappointed by this film. ""Chico"" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained."|1
"review : nunsploitation films . they ' ve been around since forever . a few that pop to mind are the ones that i had hoped to avoid but could n't do so until i started reading through them again one night in october . not only were these movies lame , they ' d been made on tape by some of the other directors . well , as much as you can watch this kind of film when you "" re on stage "" - it ' s pretty boring . if you would like to watch this movie instead , please come to the top of the stairs and see the results immediately ."|0
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. Think of that conman's conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic.|1
Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham.|1
i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema . in the past couple of years , it seems producers and directors are making a lot of mistakes to show how they can do so . we just do not understand this film . the director has done an excellent job with these people and they all seem to like him . there were plenty of times that we saw this movie , though none of us ever paid much attention to what was going through their heads after the scene with the dead man . as far as i can tell , there was nothing wrong with the character .|0
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all is the plot a very thin plot (Wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN!!!!!!!!!!|1
"The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately ""interesting"" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the ""in crowd"" and eventually starts hanging with them."|1
i took my 14 year old to see this movie . we left after 15 or 20 minutes . it looked like it was going to be a very boring night ( not that i was expecting any better ) but i guess you ca n't help the way you feel when people ask you to watch this movie and you know they are only asking for an excuse to get you to go on tv instead of watching the movie . in my opinion , it is a very cheap show with nothing to compare it to . the actors all look bad .|0
"Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an ""open"" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie ""Black Emanuelle"". It is rich and colorful."|1
this film holds 7 . 0 rating on imdb , so even i sensed something rotten in it ' s synopsis i decided to skip over the main plot and just see what else there was to see . the movie has no real dialogue at all which makes it even more interesting . if you enjoyed this book , please leave a comment or comment about it where i could be of service and we can get together later to talk further . i do not enjoy horror movies very much ( except when they involve people dying ) but i love them nonetheless , and i really appreciate the reviews for this one .|0
the positives : it ' s shot pretty well . has some interesting peripheral characters . likable main character ( albeit not very good , but a bit entertaining ) looks like an extremely young man who seems to be working hard to escape from a bad place . in any other movie i would think he was one of those cool guys who tries to take what he wants out of things . instead , he lets his anger fester for days and finally takes over , demanding that he do whatever it takes to keep himself alive . i don ' t think he actually did anything because he just got lost in his book .|0
"OK, it was a ""risky"" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to ""Bloodsurf"", the worst ""horrormovie"" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it."|1
lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more.|1
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the ""F"" word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this."|1
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. We get a pretty good look at super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end WWII. Except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. Note how it's a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. Once through, it's like any-town-USA, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family TV on the blink. Later on we see little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates.|1
i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of the series , so there is no point in me sitting through these . it was like watching a horror movie that i could never figure out . the plot just would n't get done , and the plot just kept getting weirder and weirder . at least for a while , anyway ! i do n't know about everyone else , but this film is much more terrifying than anything i have seen in years . how can you live life on a rocky island and come back to see your daughter being killed ?|0
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. Sex toys included!There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and/or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for some more glory.|1
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field!|1
"I just got back from ""AGS"". After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography ? Give me a break. The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?Aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't ""get it"" .... check."|1
"This movie reeks. No money, no acting, no nothing. I caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it ever got released to US television! Nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet ""monster""... I can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is."|1
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song.|1
"Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. The ""plot"" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he's called a ""military adviser"" but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not), helping the army of a Latin-American country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a ""sports equipment saleswoman"" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue."|1
okay , . so i went into this loving rupaul . i still love him / her but think a little less about the things that have already happened , than to be able to really remember what it is about . i know that most of you will like this movie in its first draft . i see my wife and daughter in the film . i can not leave without seeing their picture . i feel guilty for letting them spend so much money on something like this , but at least i would have been able to keep them . there is another problem .|0
"Incredibly, ""Vampire Assassin"" is significantly worse than such atrocities as ""Tequila Body Shots"" and ""Zombie Nation"" - and those movies are TERRIBLE. Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes."|1
Well I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the cast album and I've listened to it a few times I've never actually seen this show performed and I haven't seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. This version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett.|1
this is on my tv right now . . . but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this case . . . you will never believe what an amazing shot this is . i mean really ! . . this film can just as easily have been put on the bbc website or something . i was sure that there were at least a half - dozen good ones like this coming out of the movie . the best part is that even though the audience loves this show and wants to know about every little detail , most people still feel compelled to keep looking for some reason to come forward .|0
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in its treatment of this Swoon over does it by far. Worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. While it is an interestingly made film, Swoon stinks.1 out of 10 - awful.|1
the idea behind dead silence is great : zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show . i do not remember watching a zombie show in high school , but i do remember hearing about it in the news . i am really excited to find out that this will be the first live zombie show ever ! after the initial shock wore off , i found my mind racing with excitement . i thought about all the stories i could write for this show , and i was extremely excited when i heard of it .|0
"As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails."|1
it ' s said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released . since there is one thing i didn ' t see about this movie before , we didn ' t get a good enough reference for it either . on the bright side , we did get a good price to buy the first edition , and i am very happy with myself for taking such a big risk . i love my brother and would love to tell him how stupid he was . as for the production , i had a bit of trouble with it , but it all came off well .|0
"naturally sadie sucks big time , i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this story . in fact , i doubt it mattered at all since the first paragraph was a joke . i never even thought of it that way . i did not imagine the words would be funny , but i do think it is a very interesting plot . i will try to review the rest of this book while i am in town . hopefully , it wo n't take too long . contents 
 part 1 
 part 2 - my life as a kid has been nothing more than a total failure ."|0
as we are well aware , movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history , but the way it has been done is so bad - i find it hard to believe that some people would want to re - watch this crap . the only thing worse than watching something for the rest of your life is watching it on tv . they all seem to have seen it before , and no one seems to even remember why or what was made by it at all . the only thing that really surprises me is that the plot is so stupid that it actually falls into my opinion .|0
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can't figure out which is worst; Norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.Visually the film does nothing for me.|1
i really tried to like ` ` saw . ' ' the story was good , and i admire the breakneck pace of a movie that is based on an earlier version of reality . but then again , i have always hated those who do not pay attention to where they are going when it comes to real events . so this is definitely not what i expected to read about in the book . it was one of the worst comedies i have ever heard . the characters could not even begin to tell a joke . instead of being hilarious , it was just irritating .|0
lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the lens of an impressionable young woman on the verge of adulthood . this film was shown in the form of a documentary . it was supposed to show a romantic ending , but it really only showed a period of time where people who were not married were having sex . it was a movie about a beautiful young woman that had been dumped by a serial killer . it was so much worse for her than for any other movie .|0
"This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot. ""The French Line"", however, fails at all of these aspects.It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material."|1
this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the work of those who will not be happy to get paid for it . in other words , there are some really bad actors ' lives that i would prefer to avoid , but the only way i can do that is if i have to actually go through with any of my research on this subject . also , i think the premise of this project is an awful lot like that of a comedy movie about a girl that got kidnapped by a gang of thugs .|0
I'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a $5 bin I figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea.|1
possible minor spoilerit ' s not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing . like a movie you ' re never going to see unless you ' re a big fan of all the great films . there are more than 10 , 000 stories about how some people who actually get murdered in the attempt to save them are killed by their own men . this is the only thing which i really enjoyed reading about that made me hate this film . when i read the second story , it did no good , and i didn ' t enjoy it at all .|0
i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming . boy , was i ever wrong . at least i have some good stories about me and a lot of good friends . my first book was a very long one , and i did so hope it will be as long as the first few . i got to see the first three books of the series because my mom likes to watch them with me , and there were quite a few movies here that i liked , though i think she wanted to keep me interested in what i had to do over the years .|0
formulaic to the max . neither title reflects the serial ' s actual content , ` ` fighting nazis in morocco , ' or even the fact that it was written by a well - respected american author . i just want to write about what is said about this movie . there are lots of bad references to this movie ( including a lot of jokes ) , and i do not have any real interest in making sure these people live out their life . i like movies where you just read them , watch them and pretend that they were really funny .|0
though often considered peter sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send - up of medical corporate corruption . as a result , i took this book and went on to see the horror movie that i have enjoyed since 2007 . if you have n't seen this show , then you probably have not seen what it is about , but here it is ! ! it is amazing and very original , and the characters are so believable that i can hardly believe that anyone could have ever had any idea of what they were doing before this one .|0
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled Haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best.|1
"director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his japanese gangster films , which have a great deal of power and influence . this was one of those movies , though it appeared to be more interesting in person , rather than as an unflattering portrayal of american gangsters . the film ' s premise is that there are men and women living on the island who are just like them . but they are different . you will learn that in time . "" i ' ve got to get rid of him before he destroys the place . """|0
"""What Alice Found"" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who'd seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity."|1
"Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed ""genius"" by anyone who watches it. Is that really what film has become? Or is it that any time someone says ""Wow, that is so cool"" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general."|1
Why couldn't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him.The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans.|1
"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous""."|1
Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction.|1
the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i have n ' t seen every film released in this decade - but because i am not a very good person at this point . and while i would like to see another movie about people who do not want to leave their homes , that does not exactly qualify as one of the most embarrassing movies ever made . let 's face it , no matter what movie you make , you ca n't be any older than 10 when you get into a car with some strange old man who has a beard and looks like he could use a makeover .|0
I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.Grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. I am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.It ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.|1
i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( barbara stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers stories that are very good . she works as a producer for the local radio station . she is an excellent actress and has helped a lot to boost sales . she has also recently taken a leave of absence to take up writing again , which means that she will probably have to retire . she likes her new career and does n't really have much left to do . her husband is a decent guy but he has a tendency to drink too much and gets himself beat up more than he usually does .|0
what is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? a beautiful mind wasn ` t up to par , and i didn ' t care to know what this author has written or why it never made it to the screen . i think he was just really dumb on the outside , not very intelligent . but when i saw his face , i was struck speechless . in fact , i wasn ' t aware that he had even written . for some reason my heart went into the stratosphere . there was no way i could have read more than two pages at a time in all of three months .|0
"I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But, by the way, ""badger1970"" there are a few parts with bad language, not TOO bad, but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go."|1
"To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. What a great movie!!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actress ""Simran"", what a beauty. Give her an award for best looking someone."|1
Sometimes, things should just not be made. And while the set-up seemed good enough, it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror. But the problem is, its not another Saw film. Its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from Jason Voorhees.I lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film. And generally, it flopped in its attempts. True, telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first, but that grew tiring to watch.|1
"this really is an ` ` okay ' ' series . . everyone in it is pretty good . but i just ca n't believe what i 'm reading ! "" he paused , looked at his hands , and then slowly flipped back through the pages to a spot where they all could read . 
 "" that 's not quite right , there are two lines , one as you would expect from a movie like that . the second line is not very interesting . the script was incredibly bad . it was a lot worse when it started , and my guess is that it turned out to be for the better ."|0
"When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through ""the motions."" i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it."|1
i finally watched the third film in mehta ' s trilogy : ` ` fire ' ' . to begin , i ' d like to give this one a bit of serious thought and have an opinion on how it would have been so bad if we had lived in that world when it was in the middle of the year . there are some good points , but they ' ve all been made with such care that they can usually be redeemed with the help of a tv camera or dvd . i am just happy to be a part of the real action and see what happens .|0
"spoiler alert ! ! ! ! this was my son ' s review of the movie , which he wanted me to give you . it ' s a long time ago now , but you should read the comments . there are plenty of them , but only about how "" fun "" this movie is as a young adult . i have never seen him like this , and it ' s one thing to see the characters acting out what they want to do with their teenage lives , but actually seeing them doing something really stupid ? that is so not funny at all ."|0
i do n ' t really know where to start here . just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from horror , as if the movie had been filmed by someone else . how can one not be affected by what happens to people ? there is something about the movies that makes them sound even more horrible , and it scares me . when i first read the script my heart began to beat a little faster . well , you know how i feel about movies . now , i am a person that has never seen a real movie of any importance .|0
"Put simply, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest.This film can't even pass the ""Soap Opera for Dummies"" test. I'm sorry I have not read this award-winning novel, so I am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went."|1
"""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.It's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual ""good wife"" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player."|1
as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel 124 . it is an urban channel . the first movie to take me seriously were the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , so i was surprised that the movie was even remotely good . the cast was only about three or four years old when it was made and the acting was mostly horrible . i had my suspicions that some of those reviews would be taken seriously , but after seeing the number of people who got caught with their hands tied , i believed they were on drugs .|0
ok , this movie , was the worst display i have seen in years . the actors were n ' t to be trusted , and they were both terrible . if you look closely enough at these two , you can see that they are not from around here , and that some people have made a joke out of this . i wish i had been one of the few people there who could watch this movie , and it would have seemed like a fun way to spend the weekend . however , i just could n't wait to get out of there .|0
from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying something because i know a lot of americans who are great writers but this is ridiculous . i am surprised to see that this movie was actually made in the usa . i never saw this movie , but i would say it must have been made at one of the same high school . no one can tell you how many hours of hard work that takes , there is nothing as boring as watching a film like this . the characters do not make sense .|0
i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night . i ' m 20 years old and this movie is not like all of those other movies . i had to watch this movie on tv because i just couldn ' t figure out how i got into this situation . if you know what i mean . . . but i did not ! i can ' t say i thought it was interesting enough or that any of it made much sense at all . even though i tried , i just could not make sense of the ending . i felt so stupid .|0
yes , i spelled that right . this movie is so predictable , the actual word needs additional letters to get it right , but it still ends with a funny picture of a guy and a woman falling out of a building . i was not joking when i said you had to have seen this movie , it was one of the scariest movies i have ever seen . i got a better feel for it than most people , i found it amusing . however , in the first half hour , i began to get more and more annoyed by the story line .|0
gritty drama ? emotionally powerful ? blah ! the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as a romantic comedy , which was filmed by an amateur film that was more than a thousand years old . this play is not only incredibly difficult to watch it does not even do justice to its own plot . i have heard some of the cast and crew speak very little about the portrayal of these two actors ; it is hard enough to know if they were truly actors or just actors . however , you will hear from one of the main characters something that is most definitely not either of their .|0
"predictable , cliche , unbelievable , boring . . . what else can i say ? it ' s only the caliber of a novel that you should be looking for . 
 "" this is the second film in as many weeks . the first story has already been re - started but it has not been completed . the director is an elderly black man from texas who lives in phoenix and tries to keep up appearances . he ' s a good friend of the director and a great lover of old hollywood movies . they are working on the sequel to the movie when his wife runs off with one of his sons ."|0
countenance ! antoine monot , in a copycat impersonation of kevin smith ' s silent bob , keeps asking for it . how can i make this show work ? the story is good , yes , but that does not excuse the characters . i do not think there are any decent villains left around these days ( and i would hate to think so ) . they are too cowardly to act like heroes , too stupid to be believable . if you ever find yourself at a movie without a protagonist , then you should know that the plot is far more interesting than yours .|0
some films are just plain silly beyond explanation . this is one of them . words can not do justice to true love . it 's a waste of time and energy . you have to come back to life in order to read the rest .

"Also titled--> The Magical Castle--> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. Only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the ""forbidden arts"" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born."|1

"Loosely based on actual events, ""River's Edge"" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.The film begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1)."|1

If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline.|1
something of a disappointment . lee j . cobb is the anti - union head of roxton garments in new york . his main reason for being so popular was to make his films worth more than twenty million dollars , and he was n't happy about having to put up with it . i 've heard this film has one thing in common with everyone else in the country : it has a great set of drums . this movie was filmed by a very good man named david johnson , who could be relied upon to perform brilliantly on the guitar .|0
so if a guy meets you and he says 'I want you to look at my erection!' don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes! that's the only thing what happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I ever saw! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch Lennon's Erection, be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too.|1
"I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon."|1
i love the way he experiments . ab tak chappan was a thrill to watch just as much satya and al - madil as i did in 1990 . i can say this because i 've always hated that movie . but now i find myself fascinated by the concept of what 's really going on in the world . there is something about it that drives people nuts , and if you want to know who is making this film , go over there and ask the director . he 'll give you his name and address and if you can find out who it is , would you like to see him ?|0
"A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no ""I"" in ""team""!I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie."|1
That's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than David Lynch's one! The special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. That's surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six part epic! Check out David Lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!|1
i ' ve enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre . some movies have a cast and crew in the role of a villain , but these are just like any other movie : there is only one thing in it that really makes an impression - or if you don ' t know what it all is , then it ' s not worth having to watch this one either . let ' s leave that in the past , when my best friend was alive i thought she was a great actress .|0
Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.The music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and under-developed.|1
what can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster ? not that much . with the average man , we would think they were actors , but for some reason , i have no such problem . the only characters in this movie are these two idiots trying to prove that they are real actors . they start off as a couple and come out acting like they are having an affair . then , at the last minute , they start making more of themselves and showing off like they really want to do something else .|0
Don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. It is, but that, does not a good film, make.Comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series being another example).The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh.|1
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.It's a poor mans' CSI. Or actually, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought.|1
the adventures of hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie i ' ve yet run across in my professional career , but there ' s no way this is any better . not only are they very good , and we can ' t even make a video with our own hands ( or so i heard ) , but when i saw how much longer it takes to go through all of these twists and turns on the screen that i realised that the best way to get the actors to see what they truly mean is to use their imagination .|0
at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called ' the final executioner ' . . . i found this one to be absolutely hilarious , but i must admit that i had no idea what it was supposed to be about in the first place . all i really wanted to do was play with a camera and film it for posterity . as an example , i made a show of trying to take off the tape covering it . i even tried to tie it into a small bundle , but there was just too much blood , so i left it there .|0
this movie totally sucked ! ! ! do n ' t even rent it ! you ' ll hate it ! the plot is a total pain in the ass , and there are lots of good endings ! but for the last few days i have been wondering why this film should have to be so much more exciting than the other films out there . the whole thing just seems to be really cheap and lame . i feel like i want to crawl back inside my apartment and try and forget this movie ever happened . this is such an embarrassing and unappealing movie .|0
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess.Once again, my search for sleazy, European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling with crap camera-work, and abundant with awful acting (Franco regular Lina Romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing, elderly woman).|1
"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why -- I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of ""scared straight""! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me."|1
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all of the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script.|1
"""Black Vengeance"" is an alternate title for ""Ying hung ho hon"" AKA ""Tragic Hero"" (1987). I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, ""Gong woo ching"" (""Rich and Famous""), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called ""The Black Six"")."|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after this, rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You'll see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.|1
"I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (""What if something strange is going on?""...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all."|1
i loved this movie when i was a teenager . loved it . it has n ' t grown up with me very much because i am the only one who can make it even remotely funny but there is something funny about this movie , and i thought it was hilarious . at first it made me feel stupid for getting so caught up in watching it . now that i think back to my childhood memories , i will admit i wanted to get into that movie . but i knew i should have stopped watching it . the story does not have anything to do with how people act during movies .|0
this film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the kennedy assassination in 1974 , but i was not so sure . what i did know was that the movie itself had to be pretty awful for its audience to find such a horrible plot . as far as my parents knew , they only spent five minutes discussing the film . while they watched it , i could n't help but feel sorry for them . i thought that they would really love the movie and enjoy seeing how terrible it is because they never got to see it when they were children .|0
"if u haven't seen Vijay in ""Ghillli"", ""Gilly"" or ""Ghillie"". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls Velu ""Maacha"". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are brilliant as well. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it."|1
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted.|1
"This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying ""everyone has a box"" which he put his personal things into."|1
"If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you're hoping for another ""Vidocq""...well look elsewhere. It does have the same kind of story like The Mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as I was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor."|1
"Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it to the guy. In my eyes, he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.Thirst is, essentially, a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the ""rules"" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with."|1
A wasted effort. On the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event. However, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought that entering 'Enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies.|1
There were only two redeeming features about this movie; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget about the plot or storyline from the book - they're completely absent from this movie. In fact, about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. If the film makers had made a good movie, even though unrelated to the book, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not.|1
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit. How darethey? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.I really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.|1
i saw this movie with my girlfriend . it was a total disaster . you can really see it was awful . we were both so drunk that i had to stay up all night laughing the whole way through it . for some stupid reason , i thought i should get a kick out of it because it looked so funny . the characters were such losers . they were so pathetic . i would think that someone else would be good at this , but no ! this is ridiculous . i mean , this could have been a totally different scene .|0
"Oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of ""worst 80's slasher ever made"". ""The Prey"" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!)."|1
though it ' s a christmas movie , ` ` christmas in connecticut ' ' could have been done any time of year . as you can imagine this movie would have been boring and boring because it only has one character . the character is a cute little girl with brown hair and freckles . she is dressed in an elegant black dress . her eyes are red and her feet are so big that they look like they are going to jump out of her shoes just when she is about to turn around . she has a beautiful face which is so pretty .|0
the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself . they have an endless stream of jokes - which i do not like , no matter how funny they might appear to me . it makes them all seem a little less important than usual . so , for example , when i read one of the screenplays i just thought ' oh my god , look at these guys ! ' then i looked again at the character who got shot while in prison . i am sure you will know this because you saw it there on your blog .|0
"wealthy businessman ' s daughter , who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath . she does not want to go anywhere near that horrible building for fear of having it explode or burn down . the only other option is to stay in school and try to understand what has happened to make up for the death of my best friend . i am sure you know that there were many "" bad things "" about this school which i have learned are nothing compared with what happens here . they seem to do everything in their power to show me that i was made right for this class ."|0
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.As a whole I will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialog was even half way decent in Far Cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.Now besides the fact that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role.|1
"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg."|1
it starts a little slow but give it a chance . in the spirit of the ` ` wackiest ship in the water ' , i do my best to watch the action on the film and see if any of the characters seem to have some type of mental illness . i think it will be nice to meet someone who is willing to talk with me . i did n't go to high school or college so i am pretty sure i could have made it through high school without reading this movie . as you may have seen i was an avid sports fan by heart , especially when i was into football .|0
after having problems in chicago , the solomon family moves to a remote north dakota farmhouse to start anew , but they can never find out what was wrong with the house . if you are a movie star , there is no point in watching them on a large tv set like this one . however , it also gives you an excuse to watch a commercial break and see if you can buy something at your local supermarket . these movies had great dialogue and excellent lines , but i would not recommend making a movie without some feedback .|0
donald sutherland , an american paleontologist visiting england , picks up a hitch hiker one evening . two years later , this guy has to get back into a car and go off to meet another hitchhiker in the mountains . his name is peter mcmurtry , but he was originally from germany . he works at a ranch in the hills of the appalachian mountains . peter mcmurtry ' s first sighting of the great white bear was when he and his brother took their hunting dog out to see the grizzlies that had been terrorizing it since early 1994 .|0
^ ^ contains spoilers ^ ^ this movie is utter crap . do not watch . there is no one in this movie to root for , or make sense of . why do they think ? i should ask who they are thinking about and if they are thinking about me . oh , look , here comes the hero , walking out of a store . how nice ! when he reaches the end of the aisle , he sees a man with a beard holding a gun , shoot him and the shot starts all over again .|0
"Like Margot in ""Fear of Fear"" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in ""Fox and his friends"" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in ""The Stationsmaster's Wife"" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German ""Wirtschaftswunder""-Society after World War II in R.W."|1
i ca n ' t really criticize this film . it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead in one of those horror movies . it was just too good to be real , however , and by the third time you re bored , you know that it ai nt . i mean , if there s some kind of a sequel , i d rather have looked through it myself . but no - one wants to watch something they are made to see , especially when it comes from someone who has been working as a teacher at his own school for only 20 years .|0
"i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out . i recall the scariest scene was one of my dad and his friends trying to take a girl to bed . she was pretty , "" i said as i held up the dvd . it was an old movie that they were not able to buy for $ 20 , 000 . on the top right hand side , there was a huge drawing of a red star in the background . you can just read the story underneath the picture . it was very funny ."|0
this thing , directed by french sensation patrick sebastien , is worst than all the turkeys that you may have ever seen . i do n't care if it 's the greatest movie in the history of the world . it just makes me sick to think about . i did not expect this and yet it was so big . i had hoped that some of the acting would be great , but this was as good as any other movie . this was even better than the ' 80s . this was the worst movie i have ever seen .|0
"i just saw this movie and all i can say is , where are the drive in ' s these days ? it 's really hard to picture .

"One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see, I guess he's fair game to criticize. And that's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a ""star"") Being gay and forty, I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover."|1
This film could have been great- but wasn't. Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one stripped off. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish.|1
From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights.|1
This is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around. It is heartrending, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius.I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the movie adaptation), and I was just enraptured by the characters. I laughed out loud more than once.|1
anyone who knows anything about evolution would n ' t even need to see the film to say ` ` fake ' ' . it just happens that i had one very important question in the beginning , and i did n't think it would be worth asking . this movie has so many great ideas for different movies that it gets lost in your mind if you are not a fan of them . now do n't get me wrong , i loved this movie , and i wanted to learn more about evolution , but my curiosity got the better of me and i found out that i really like this other movie .|0
There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims.|1
(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.|1
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. The twist is that instead of frail old L. Ron Hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood.|1
this movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! i waste my time watching a movie that i had no intention of watching in the first place . i just wanted some fun for myself , and if you do n't like it , feel free to leave me a message on my voicemail . i can hardly imagine what you must be thinking right about now . there is something completely off about this movie , and i ca n't understand how someone could agree with it . i will say this , it is more boring than i expected .|0
The film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. Those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films).|1
` ` you can survive anything ' ' . anything except a dumb horror flick . the director could n ' t even decide if it has any merit to this movie . but i read all the reviews and the dialogue . the director does have an uncanny knack for seeing the worst of everyone , especially when they are doing a well - made story . this is my favorite film in the world . i would like to take a break from this script so i could watch the action with you guys . it ' s kind of depressing to watch somebody die .|0
had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called ` ` half empty . ' ' i usually go out with other couples who watch this movie . it makes me feel so guilty ! what are the odds that they would end up watching this movie ? well , one of the only things that make this movie interesting is the lack of anything exciting or funny about it . you do n't have to watch this at all : there are some good comedy movies here in the city , but it just does n't interest me very much .|0
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans.|1
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success ""The Gay Divorce"" (a title which was considered too scandalous for American moviegoers, though it was used in the U.K.) concerns a man and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. Betty Grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number ""Let's K-nock K-nees"" with overtly sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout."|1
With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye Kira, this is re-Atonement. This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace.|1
I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play. As I watch Jacobi, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding Hamlet's character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else.|1
the prior comments are way to generous . this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic . on the one hand , as i watched this horror movie with you in my bed , i wished i had done the thing right . now , let me start off by saying that your favorite movie is nothing short of terrible . why did they do something like this ? it is supposed to be a classic . if you think it 's bad then it makes no sense . i just ca n't figure out what is wrong with them !|0
Now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn made for TV independent horror films ever made! I normally hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the film was! But somehow I took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film.|1
"Saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played ""Noel"", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good."|1
idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots , yes camp blood ( or if so , why ? ) ! you know i would have been totally devastated . it 's the best film i ever saw , but it sounds like the worst thing i had ever heard . this was actually the best film i have ever seen in all of my twelve years of high school , which is saying a lot since there are lots of awful people out there who do not seem to understand what that movie really is .|0
"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer.This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (""Pauline"") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. It's talk, talk, talk and more talk. For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless French morality play."|1
charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen . but this movie lacks everything that i would want to give them , and some of those good moments are just too weak to take credit for a lot of the actors and characters . in fact , when i first saw this film , i thought there must be some way to make it better . so here is the main purpose of this film . the show is based on a bunch of unmemorable characters who go about their normal lives with little to no hope or direction at all .|0
wow . i just saw demon wind a little while ago , and i do n ' t think i ' ll ever forget it . like this film is completely unwritten . it has about an hour - long segment on the first half . there is very little to tell other than how bad things were between the movie and the local news , and what kind of people would want to see a horror movie for that kind of money . there are several scenes that i didn ' t watch . the most horrible part of the film is that the actors seem to be working together rather than apart .|0
this is a little - seen anti - war film that has been ignored for too long . the time is thanksgiving of 1972 and i am looking forward to seeing the movie while i am here . in addition , i was just thinking how lucky i am to have grown up in a good family and live in a nice house . it all had to go so wrong but at least we made a few sacrifices . i have to say , i really did love this film . i was very glad when it was released .|0
you know , this is one of those ` ` emperor ' s new clothes ' ' films . it ' s like , oh , i don ' t know , if you are a movie fan or something and you don ' t want to buy anything else , then you can ' t really be bothered to change the movies , can you ? they look like a bunch of clowns in a clown mask . that ' s why he ' s been acting weird lately . anyway , the film started with a little old woman who looks like she has aged ten years .|0
i was just lucky i found this movie . i ' ve been taking advantage of walmart ' s $ 5 . 50 dvds in the last three days . i won ' t get any fun with that movie because it ' s full of crap . i really don ' t want to watch it , but if there is one thing that is a bad movie , it is an awful movie . i ' m sorry for you and your son , but why did you not pay attention to this movie before ? ! what are you going to do about him ?|0
"If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, ""Yep. That's exactly right."" It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice."|1
"this is one of the worst movies i ' ve ever seen . it ' s supposed to be a remake or an action movie . if it ' s going to be a bad movie , i ' ll give them a script and they can write their own script . "" "" you should watch it more often . in fact , i was actually thinking about it as soon as i saw it . it ' s one of the worst horror films i have ever seen . how am i supposed to get over - reacting to that ?"|0
I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a Bruce movie for you watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear.|1
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across.|1
once again bronson ' s talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which ( uncut ) is far more realistic than anything else in this movie . when i first saw this film , it was made by a young woman with no real aspirations to fame , money or fame . from the beginning i thought that i could have been the star of this movie , but there is nothing remotely similar about this movie so i decided to keep my mouth shut about it for now . as a matter of fact this is the first time that this movie has been directed by anybody except me .|0
death camp opera : right here , right now ! ten years ago , i read that a very special and wonderful movie should have been produced in this way , but no . it would have ruined this movie . instead , i found myself staring into the camera for the rest of the movie , only to discover my wife has gone through a phase where she ca n't remember the most important part of this movie . after several hours , she gives up and turns off the television and goes to sleep . i watched this one because i loved it .|0
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.You will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. You've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.Next, enter absolute rubbish talent.|1
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent.|1
"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.The fights are not of high standards. They are way too ""simple"" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success."|1
why bother , itv ? admittedly , mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to ` ` get , go , go ' . when we first started watching this , it was very exciting . but once you were up in these mountains , there was nothing scary or exciting about the place - except for one minor flaw that did make us stop and take a couple of pictures at the end . the scenery had changed . i can not imagine anything that would do such an interesting story . however , i am pretty sure that the idea of making some sort of video game sounded really cool .|0
ok , number one - this ` ` film ' ' is a ` ` 90 ' s ' ' version of a crappy show from the 1970s . the movie has been on the market for about 50 years and was completely unproduced . in 1994 , it was actually filmed in new orleans , where i lived . i guess i expected to see an impressive collection of modern films , but what i saw was something even more depressing than that . as you will probably notice , i did not go to the movies with many other people at all .|0
This movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. I find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.This movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.There is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. There is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten.|1
i ' m a sucker for a decent superhero movie . ( i ' m not counting super bug budget , no ! ) this was n't a bad idea . the characters and dialogue are great , and the script is good . this movie is like nothing i have had in my time . it ' s not as bad as the one i wrote before , but it ' ll take a lot to make me think twice about doing this movie . at first i thought it would be better if i went back to my old school .|0
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! But do! I expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot!|1
"if you liked the grinch movie . . . go watch that again , because this was no where near as good as i thought it would be . "" i laughed and said , "" i ca n't believe you just said that ! we are not supposed to watch anything remotely like that . i mean , i know my dad made a lot of money on those movies - but there is something really bad about watching one of these in the daytime . how could anyone watch it at night ? why do people watch this stuff after it gets out of hand ?"|0
"This isn't ""so bad it's good""--It's ""so bad, it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment""! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even figure out the ""plot"" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" is like saying that ""Gigli"" is like ""Citizen Kane""."|1
"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, ""Camp Bloody awful""), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... Awful acting-check. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. It doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable."|1
"Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.Have you ever heard the expression ""as exciting as watching paint dry""? That pretty much sums up Satanik."|1
no pun intended . i ' m not going to spoil anything about the story , but it ' s safe to say that the author didn ' t like me much at the time . in fact , most of the people in the movie were horrible , and the director had a hard time keeping them all straight . i ' m just grateful that i got a chance to watch this film because i know that this book would have been too boring to pass up . as an addition , i was pretty sure that my first thought when i saw this movie is that they are not very interesting .|0
this is an interesting , hard to find movie from the early 70 ' s starring jan michael vincent as a hollywood producer and actress . of course , this film had no actual production ability , other than it was a lot of work and it was difficult to see where it got off on . but that was ok , i guess . what really surprised me was the way they left it in its original form . how can someone leave it there for such a long length of time when they should have been making so many movies ?|0
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in Paris and forget it's Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft.|1
"I can see what this film was intending to do. Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. The ""reality crime"" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book."|1
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever . i fell bad for all the actors and actresses who got into a fight . the movie was actually pretty interesting . as i watched the movie i could not help but find it slightly funny . you just saw one of the best movies i had ever watched . everyone else in the movie , which i can remember , really looked like real people . i did not think anybody would want to watch a movie when they were already in the 80s , but here they are watching it at the same time .|0
` ` black dragons ' ' is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time . it ' s not as good , i can assure you . there are lots of different movies but none that make you laugh . in any event , the original story was nothing more than just a load of lies . the only person who really knew how badly things went was a former nazi general and he ended up going to prison for three months before being sentenced to death . they let this film run for almost a year before turning it off .|0
Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. They aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No.Acting, corny and rubbish.Sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.Cinematography. These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix.|1
If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields, and Chaplin. I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women?|1
"uggh ! hanna - barbera of the 60s and 70s ! what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by the ' 80s ' . i got to see this when we were young : it did n't make much sense . i remember being amazed at how easy it would be for someone like you to get off the couch and spend the whole evening watching horror flicks on dvd with only two movies in her house . but this was not my favorite movie so far . it was one of those things where all people have to say is "" thank you "" and no explanation whatsoever is expected from them ."|0
"the basic plot is good and can be engaging . the music is so great that it became the theme of the story for the first few days . however , when you see the "" star "" in this film , you know how awful it all is - there is nothing about it worthy of a movie . i mean , i was there , too , but i did n't recognize it . not only is it an old horror film , but it 's horrible to watch , even if it 's a real one . i guess i just ca n't see anything good about it ."|0
i just saw this movie for the second time . i first saw it back in the mid - 90 ' s as part of the nineties . it was pretty funny , though , especially since most of the time i did not really believe it existed . i had seen lots of horror movies , but this one was hilarious . the plot was so ridiculous it was almost too much to take a chance on . and yet i loved it ! there were many more comedic comedies than this . if you have been watching any of those , then you know what this movie does ?|0
I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. However, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet *real* for me. Before I saw this version, Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English. Having seen Jacobi's Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording.|1
"mount godwin - austin ( otherwise known as k2 ) is the world ' s second highest mountain , and if the evidence shows that he actually had a good time there , it is easy to see why . when you read "" king of the underworld "" , your head begins to spin . what is really going on ? was this supposed to make the whole thing more interesting for the reader ? i wonder if any of the characters at all know their true identities ? i 'm not looking forward to reading this but it has to be here . it just does n't fit the character ."|0
i am a firm believer that a film , tv serial or any form of art should and would be viewed with objectivity . i love to watch them all . this one is very good , though it must be said that i enjoyed watching it before the movie began . there are so many wonderful sounds coming out of those two speakers . i have never seen such amazing music in my entire life ! i had just left the house when i was hit with a cold chill . my body instantly went from hot to cold and i think my blood froze in my veins .|0
having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews / janeseymour version , i have to say that this is not as much fun as you think . it seems like only a couple hours ago when i saw this video , my heart began to sink . there are other movies that would make me feel better than this , but no . i just had to give it some time to hit its high points on the right side of the screen . the scenes were awful , but they were really interesting . if you do n't like them , try to get out of the movie and go see them again .|0
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'The Companions'.|1
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening, thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. On this promise, at least, the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual, adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. As does the movie. A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty, rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning.|1
if extreme activities ( and i do n ' t mean the hollywood ones like ufc & x - games ) and the people who came out of that film were pretty bad , but i don ' t think they were as bad as they looked . there were some good looking men in high school who just did what was expected of them and got away with it . then there were the women who were n't so bad , and some of the other girls who just didn ' t really give a shit for anyone or anything .|0
"The mission to see the movie ""The Cave"" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.The immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. What's he going to look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic?"|1
I can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying).|1
wow . . . this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who ' s idea this was and what soup they put into it . a lot of people like to watch movies , especially horror movies . we all have those types of things . but some of us love to watch old movies because we always enjoy them as much as the average person in high school . i never really had the inclination to watch something like this , so i just saw this one on my own when i was in college and thought it looked pretty good .|0
"The ""silver screen"" gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy, humor and lust for life. The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to ""live each day as if it's your last"" and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!"|1
i realize most people do n ' t know who solomon kane is and that the film is pitched at that much low cost so to speak . in other words , it is just another example of the high cost of trying to find ways out of doing whatever it is this guy did . i am pretty positive this film was about the best sex movie ever made on earth , except maybe in some places where there really is no sex , but it will take time and lots of practice for anyone to come to understand the true value of sexual act as a physical activity ( like masturbation or sex ) .|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint.|1
Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film.|1
"This movie was lacking in a lot of areas. It's about this Elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. THey want the Elvis guy to be their ""driver"". At times, I wanted the folks from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. Sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as ""What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE"". That was cheesy."|1
this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person . the sound tracks are not exactly the best , but if you do n't watch them it 's probably not the best that you have seen in your entire life . however , the film was excellent and the plot looked great . i guess it takes more than an ' 80s tv show or movie to get me to write a review of this movie , so i would be lying if i said i did not enjoy the last few moments . we had such a good time and i am really proud of my book .|0
"It's painfully obvious that the people who made this ""movie"" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish.The movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever. I'm SURE that I could make a better movie with my friends. To me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much."|1
this movie was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war - - most likely in anticipation of what happened to the military during world war ii . i could not tell you why it should be good because i really do not pay a lick of attention to the content of that film . but the plot and characters were interesting , even enjoyable . from time to time , something about the movie makes my eyes roll up into my head . however , this one is not quite as entertaining . i did not watch the movie ; i simply watched the series for a few minutes .|0
This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs.|1
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Its been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way! !|1
Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest.|1
where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters ? firstly the script is one of the most complex and difficult to write - not to mention disturbing . secondly the plot is a lot , much too sloppy . the main character has no sense of humour whatsoever . the plot is simply ridiculous . it is an incredibly boring , repetitive story with a lot of negativity mixed in . i find myself staring at the blank screen trying to figure out how to put the book away . this is the first time i have seen a movie made with the intention of making some sort of joke .|0
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had 350,000 dollars to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie....Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this movie....To small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better.|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma, being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.|1
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff.|1
"I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters."|1
got the chance to see this at a friend ' s house today , and was impressed with what it achieved . i thought that the film was really fun , and i actually liked it . when i read about this film in the paper , i wondered why there were no stories about it on any of the net . i have to say that i did enjoy watching it . it is a bit odd that this movie was taken so early in the 21st century . i am not sure if the actors themselves are even capable of doing anything .|0
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard.|1
i rented this movie expecting it to suck , and it did n ' t let me down . i rented it because i like the character , and that 's why i love him . i mean , i do n't have much in the way of experience at this level , except for some of the good movies i made . my sister and her friends are totally clueless as to how to act around these guys . they are all just completely focused on their own problems . when you get into the movie , you never want to leave the place . i can see why .|0
"take a bad script , some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you expect when you read that ? ! the only thing i am going to have to say at this point is something like , "" no , i wo n't give a damn about this movie . why are they letting it make this film ? all i 'm worried about is being stuck here with a group of guys who talk about killing each other while drinking blood from the heads of their loved ones and eating their flesh . if i were them , i 'd just kill themselves ."|0
this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos . it ' s done really well , but we have to say that it didn ' t happen in a good way . there was a bad episode , which probably wasn ' t too amusing , and some people ( like my parents who don ' t want to be associated with this stupid movie ) started complaining about how bad the story sounded , and not just because it was dumb . they even started accusing each other of trying to make something bigger from their mistakes .|0
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! The plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. More unrecoverable life time wasted!If you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once.|1
okay , so gus van sant wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern art . i found this out on my first night of teaching , a few years ago at a local school . there are a lot of guys who would rather do the job themselves than be taught by a high school girl who thinks they have something important to give their country . i always liked the way she spoke and how her english was extremely good . she was quite nice and seemed to enjoy teaching me .|0
it ' s clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters . but the actors were too tired from their long journey to find the plot and so it was made up on their own . i must admit , i didn ' t think this movie had it ' s character involved in such a short length of time either . i thought this movie would be much easier if it had a screenplay and not just a script . i should have known that it wasn ' t like that . we couldn ' t have done it without this guy ' s skills .|0
Watching the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody, but I'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that), and I can assure you it's not worth watching. It's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte.|1
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. Have a look at the outfits. Everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! It's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows.|1
I cannot understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company,but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic(Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to grant it the same BOMB review they gave it in the 1970's).With so many scene stealers on display,Sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role.It all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15AM,but Sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon!|1
Back in the 70's, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.We begin in an isolated insane asylum.|1
i ca n ' t believe i sat through this garbage . palm trees in d . c . ( already mentioned ) , a big one , so what 's the problem here ? we 're supposed to be having a picnic . who the hell does these people think they are ? ! ! why do n't they just take us out of this place and start doing something other than just sit on the sidelines and play basketball with their friends ? it seems like it should have been an off day , and i would have done better to enjoy my first day at school .|0
As a serious marathoner, I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. While I did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of Deena Kastor, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: These were brief!!|1
honestly , how hard can it be to make a good remake ? obviously pretty hard ! i was soooo sick of this game . i loved it . i knew we were supposed to go out to the pub and hang out , but i just could n't stomach it . so we went for pizza and drinks . my mother insisted on helping me . i 'm sure she thought i did n't feel like going anywhere , but i really did n't care . i have never been in a restaurant that was so busy with people dancing and talking about what they were doing .|0
"if you ' re a fan of the original series , do not see this movie . i should have been skeptical from the first , but it ' s like watching a classic movie with so much action and such a great dialogue . i found that i would rather watch a horror movie in which a woman is taken to bed by a large animal than be caught out in the middle of an apocalypse . there are a lot of gory images here , including a few gruesome "" shootout "" scenes on tv . i ' m just lucky the film was cut at all or else i would have gone crazy ."|0
in fassbinder ' s earlier films , his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them . he was always a perfectionist that i never liked at all . however , when it comes down to the end of the story , the protagonist simply does what he 's told and leaves the movie as it was . for those of you who may not like my movies , i would like to thank many of your readers who took this journey to write this novel . they loved the characters because they were so different from one another . but the plot is also a mystery .|0
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties.|1
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sound familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this has got to sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just have a heart attack and die from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades? wet bandits?...oh wait, that last one's been used) try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled (Druish?)|1
"My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as ""fat girls."" I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level."|1
i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time . i ' ve always been intrigued by her and thought that she may look quite beautiful , even if she didn ' t speak french much . i have to say that i would have enjoyed seeing her perform with the same kind of confidence as all those others . i ' ve always thought she could be a little scary at times but i suppose she just doesn ' t care . i was so excited to learn about this movie . it is actually a very good movie which i had seen several times when i was young .|0
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.|1
two little girls strike a friendship . one tries to convince the other she ' s a witch . the other is convinced she ' s a fairy tale . what an idiotic story it could have made , and how did it end up in such a mess ? at least if i was there , i might have done some research on it . instead i ended up writing this for the first time in years . i don ' t know how i can help , so here i am , reading this novel of mine and having a conversation with a character who ' s seen too many episodes of this very stupid show .|0
"Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was totally stupid... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something to the effect of, ""Don't tell (insert the guy's name)."|1
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.|1
the submarine used was not varangian ! ' it ' was in fact two boats , p614 and p615 , both of which have been used by the crew for years . that means it ' s very simple to believe that they were there on a suicide mission as well as having a long history of drugs being smuggled back from abroad . at least i got to look through the files after all . it just might be worth a try to see if what i suspect about these two men are true . i will give you an estimate of the amount of time i ' ve had to sift through this whole thing .|0
"The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled ""Our Family Trouble."" To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line."|1
this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far. i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes....'9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated.|1
"This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see ""Black Day, Blue Night."" There is the late, great J.T. Walsh (""Swing Blade,"" ""Pleasantville,"" ""Red Rock West,"" ""The Last Seduction,"" and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (See also ""Breakdown"")."|1
this film is absolute cinematic genius . it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance and the actors are not as bad as i would have expected , considering they seem to be all of about twenty or thirty years older than the characters themselves . it also gives me hope that my critics will actually be able to produce a good script . despite having seen the film several times , the scene is terribly boring . the dialogue is completely inadequate . there are so many elements of the same character , but the plot just keeps going backwards .|0
if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you ' re hoping for another ` ` vidocq ' ' . . . . . just make sure there ' s nothing interesting about this one , because you ' re not getting it , i don ' t give a shit about the whole thing . all i know is that i ' m supposed to be doing a search on this guy who was involved in the assassination . i have been told he is an extremely well known terrorist group . what sort of a man does that ? what kind of leader does that ?|0
comparisons to the original series are inevitable . it ' s a shame diana rigg left the original show in the first place because she didn ' t see it like this . when the film was originally released , there were about 3 , 000 actors who were willing to share with their families how they felt about what was about to happen . that ' s how it is . for the next few weeks , all the action on the movie screen had been focused solely on those who wanted the story . we know now that the majority of the movies were made up by local people from around the country .|0
this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy , but also the best of the series ! it was an amazing work of a great comedy . to my surprise , i found that the director of this film actually likes me . so , here we go again . i 'm glad you enjoyed it enough to buy it , and i am truly sorry for your loss . thank you for watching it . i sincerely hope you will forgive me for being so short - sighted on the movie . i just wish i could find the words to describe what i had seen that day .|0
sandra bullock is my favorite actress . . . . . but this movie was so horrible , i could n ' t help but chuckle to myself at one of her jokes . after the ending of the film , i went to get something to eat . i have never seen that movie before and i wanted to see it for a second time . while eating , i thought about what i should do . i did not like the idea of going over there again . i felt like i had just seen a movie in which some kid has been trying to kill his own father because his parents were murdered .|0
"""Prime Suspect 4"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal."|1
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a bore-fest from start to finish, that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. Neil Young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle-of-the-road mediocrity.|1
i ca n ' t express enough just how bad this film was . first of all what a waste of some of my money . second of all , the author is not even on the production side . she could have made more if she thought it would put me at ease about her story and her characters . secondly , it 's really boring to watch movies that should be released in the mid 1950 ' 80s . but i love these films . i feel so happy for the people who watched them and enjoyed them . it gives me hope that they are still interested in making a movie .|0
for a series that was inspired by kolchak , it ' s ironic that the x files first attempt at a movie is about some people who were once rich . in this story , i saw the same film in the book but it ' s hard to explain . my opinion of the acting is somewhat biased because the cast consists largely of an old woman and a young man with two children . i think they ' re both teenagers , probably from san francisco , but i doubt it . anyway , the director ' s character doesn ' t have any knowledge of the characters and their history .|0
"This is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The lead part Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This film is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l Abner strip! The problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the ""love story"" might make your head hurt."|1
I won't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, Derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother.|1
"This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV performances and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work. There's even a few shots from ""Son Of Dracula"". This movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed."|1
one should not be too critical about the director ' s second feature . i really like the camera work of madiba . i think its a good idea that we have a little fun . i do n't think anyone will notice , or care , at this point if we start shooting in groups , but we can add some quality time to the first two sets . there are lots of photos of people running through the streets , doing things , and getting killed . the story is that it was an attempt to create a peaceful environment for those who were forced to go on a journey out of their homelands .|0
"I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say ""Like Pelswick"" and go on with what ever he was originally doing."|1
i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie . of course as i ' m sure you know that , the only reason my wife and i liked it was because it was such a wonderful movie . well , for example , i am very proud of your film and would love nothing better than to have a chance to show you a special talent . but i just can not seem to do that . i really want to take a quick break to watch this movie and give you an opportunity to see why i like it so much .|0
"his music , especially what we hear of it here , is very slow . from around the time of this movie i was a bit curious to learn that there were many songs written by different artists . the one which caught my attention the most , was "" why you ca n't sing for real "" . the main point being that no matter how hard you try , you still ca n't do your job well enough not to fall asleep and die right at the table . as far as musical tastes go , it has definitely been better than the alternative rock station i have worked on for over fifty years ."|0
"Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named ""To Kill For"". It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ""ability to sell"". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.Maybe the fact the delightful, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18."|1
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. Check out the minuscule crew credits on Camp Blood, there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in, its Brad and his buddies and thats it, no pretentious rubbish. Jennifer Ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts.|1
loki , norse god of mischief , creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon - like powers . at the end of it all , you are told to take this book to a friend in stockholm who will give you what you want to read . the first time i tried this out i thought it was a really bad idea and would have probably made a better story than the second one . but the third is even worse . there are no real characters . there is just an uninteresting collection of short story replays which does nothing other than make you wonder why people think this world is such a great movie .|0
I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. He's a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-jail TV interview.The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually MADE her serve it) .|1
This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt, ring true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even though it is right for the story, because I had already come to care about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber work all around, even to the use of just the right sound and/or music to advance the story.|1
I mean, come on! This movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.I was really hoping this would be a good movie.|1
"childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie , terrible acting , cheesy dialogue , and not quite ` ` the man in the white robe ' . "" this is not one of my favourite films ; i really just wanted to watch something like ' the wolf ' for once . however , here are some wonderful scenes that i had no idea were so awful . as a matter of fact , i thought it might be worth watching because it did n't even get very good . when the characters tell jokes , they do so out of love ."|0
this is a low budget , well acted little gem . alice , a small town massachusetts teenager , fed up of seeing the old movies as an escape to a different era . i think she was trying to get off the bus and stay on the road in order to live like a regular person . it does n't work . i am sorry if you are too bored to see this movie but i really ca n't read the words in front of us . we should have been able to watch it on the radio but instead we just watched another film with all the drama of a typical teen movie .|0
i saw this film when it premiered in la . i think i laughed 2 or three times . the only thing that came out of it were some really lame jokes from the plot . i could n't see any humor , but i did catch some interesting moments . i can not say i enjoy the movie and the characters are extremely funny . so what if they act like they are being funny ? the movie was very boring to watch . i am pretty good with the acting . i was glad that my brother is here to guide me through this film .|0
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. Unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan!|1
i ' ve been studying brazilian cinema since 2004 , when i stumbled onto ` ` cidade de deus / city of the dead ' . i wrote it in the 1920s , just a few weeks after all the movie stars were turned away , and so i had no idea how to do it . i wanted to watch it with somebody who understands what this film is like - someone who really wants to see it . unfortunately , i didn ' t know anything about it then , and i ' re still not sure if this film is real or based on some sort of sci - fi myth .|0
"There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the ""most obvious"" woman she's ever met."|1
"this really is a cringe making exercise . dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes , i can hardly stand the idea of shooting anyone that looks like someone who would kill for sport . even though they are all completely useless there is something about these two that just do n't catch my fancy . i have been unable to work out how this guy does it , why he still has a car and why he never seems to leave his house at night . "" i ca n't decide which part of this is the least annoying ."|0
"Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the ""wasted talents"" expression. I had never EVER seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein,and so on). The ""aging"" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. The use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that I could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly."|1
hello , looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night ? ca n ' t find what i need here , you know that ? anyway , as i was saying , this will give me a good look at the book . it is one of my favorites . all the characters seem to be talking and there are no lines in the middle so i ca n't say how many of them there are . i would guess only about twenty or thirty . i am thinking that maybe this movie is a little too boring for this kind of cinema .|0
Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. When entering this, I noted that it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was neither!|1
"a brash , self - centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps . in a typical military career , i think it is safe to assume that if he were to go to prison for the crime , he could easily end up being kicked out . unfortunately , there was no sign of him , so i decided to leave him here and try to find some sort of lead that will lead us to something better . 
 "" you have n't even answered my question , sir , "" i hear someone say behind me . i do n't look back ."|0
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it.|1
Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick.|1
cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . with a script that looks like it should have been written by somebody who had spent his life filming , i think the only person who is truly lacking in editing experience would be don ' t bother . don ' t you agree ? if you go through this , you wouldn ' t find what you are looking for at all . don ' t even bother reading this movie because you don ' t have a clue how it will relate to any of these movies .|0
whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot . in this case once was enough . iron eagle , at least , is a fairly accurate artist . it is hard not to get distracted when someone paints something so obviously uninspired . but for the sake of consistency , let 's put iron eagle out of mind and concentrate on producing a great work of art . as i have already told you , some people prefer to spend their life trying to build something new , while others like to just keep doing what they do . there are many good reasons why iron eagle did not appeal to me .|0
"I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. It barely matters because the dire acting, clichéd camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-Shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. ""Get thee out of here!"" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain."|1
"I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after ""Eraser."" ""End of Days,"" however, can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in. ""End of Days"" starts well with a gripping action sequence, yet quickly becomes a bore, taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read ""Doomsday""). Performances are stale, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful."|1
This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development.|1
this is a rip - off of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer . but , really ? the only thing that does n't make me happy about this film is the parts of the dialogue where there is nothing at all out of the ordinary to report . they are just as bland as any of the movie trailers i watched . not exactly what i would have wanted for christmas , though . if my brother was reading this script right now , he would be thinking : it 's a terrible movie , even worse than i ever could have guessed .|0
the animal - eating ( geek ) scenes were not as bad as you would think . after having watched mondo cane for almost three months i got to have my first taste of it . i did n't know what to make of the story , or even whether it was something that a writer should write . in the back of my mind i thought it might be an action film , although i was sure it was all too silly for such a young age ! there was a great deal of laughing and joking about the character . there were some funny jokes but nothing very funny .|0
Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There's the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. Unlike Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible.|1
"Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word ""STUPID"" over and over again? Probably.This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just excused myself and walked out."|1
we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set , under the title ` ` the broken skull . ' that 's a good one ; they all have to go to school , and every other story is a lame attempt by them to make it something more than just a bit of a horror film . then again , nobody else has seen the films since their inception . i 've read several articles on the classics of the time , but i 'd say those were the only words that really made any sense in the whole thing .|0
"too much stock footage ( almost one third of this 53 minute film ) really slows this one down . i just watch these shows because it is all i have to show for a long , long time . i watched the same thing in school , with my sister , and was so relieved that she did n't have anything to worry about . i remember her saying something like , "" we are going to kill you if you do this . no way ! "" i was so impressed by this movie that i could n't believe what i was watching on screen ."|0
i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just so you can go home and watch it every night . i hope it will be all right for you to hear this movie , but if you hate it , feel free to pick out a different one or else i do not recommend it to you . in addition to the movie , this film actually has a lot of drama . i had a friend who used to like to watch it at least twice a week and would spend hours watching it in his car .|0
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he has been investigating Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans.|1
a real let down , the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for a bad comedy of the first order and did not fare as i originally thought . it really does suck , i can not wait to see if there is any mention of the film . what a total letdown ! i am very much hoping to see more movies like this one , it makes me sick . i hate that i will have to read some of them again . after reading the first draft of this script ( i have never wanted to listen to a story ever ) i just ca n't wait anymore .|0
"My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. After starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. Now, he stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies."|1
earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust . well , parts of the earth , because somewhere in italy there was a nuclear holocaust . but other parts of the world did not survive the holocaust . that is how we view it . some people think this is from the ' 70s . it is an ugly piece of sci - fi and stuff you might wish you could avoid . i have seen better movies , and i certainly would not enjoy them if i were you . the plot may be dull and tedious , but it really is boring . the worst thing about it is its content .|0
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, Roundtree's small part is a far cry from his ""Shaft"" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in ""The Toolbox Murders"" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet)."|1
chop shop . written and directed by ramin bahrani ( man push cart ) . bahrani specializes in character driven vehicles . for those who like to travel , then you can see how a journey like this could end up in the company of a good - looking girl , who has some great talents . i 'm sure she is going to make quite a film someday . well , i really did not have much of a choice in the matter . on the one hand , we are getting ready for a big movie about an author who works for a foreign correspondent known as hapax .|0
i love old ` ` monster movies ' ' for the pure camp value . this one does not disappoint if you think about it . it has been a long and tiring week , and as always , i have to say i enjoyed myself . at least they let me watch the first half - hour of movie before i was forced out of the theater . then i watched another part of the movie until the credits had run out . by the time i finally drifted off to sleep my mind was still racing with possibilities .|0
As a big Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly came alive and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri.|1
` ` disappointing ' ' is the best word i could think for this film , especially considering the glowing reviews it gave . i do not even know where to begin and there is nothing on it that can compare to this . it is absolutely horrible ! if i was an actor of this genre , i would be more concerned about the effects on my movie than the content of this story . in fact , i have been watching this documentary over and over for the past month . i did not sleep well the night before - i had too much bad dream .|0
what a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2 . 1 on the imdb scale as i write this . folks , i feel like i just got hit with a hammer . and i do not feel that it is the worst film i have ever seen . i love this movie : the characters are so stupid , they even seem to be trying to act out some terrible plot . there is no rhyme or reason behind it . the plot is unlikable and the character is ridiculous . i am having a hard time comprehending why most of the movies appear to be very realistic .|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-TV-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session.|1
"in this approximately 34 - second thomas edison - produced short , we see annabelle moore performing the loie fuller - choreographed ` ` serpentine dance ' ' waltz ' for about 30 seconds . i was looking forward to this video ( it is a film based on an episode of ' how you live ' ) but had little time to appreciate the dramatic effects of the show . my only concern was to figure out what the heck they are trying to fool the camera with , but the only explanation i heard for them being ' wild ' and ' silly ' was not that they were "" stupid "" or anything ."|0
"let ' s face it . this movie is incredibly cliche , as korean romance dramas and movies go . first of all , it was the only film ever made by a korean film director and they didn ' t like each other much . this one had an uninspiring ending with two women trying to make love . i think it ' s about time someone in this book realized how very hard it "" s going to be for you to find anyone who doesn ' t want to try and seduce you . but that wasn ' t the problem ."|0
It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors.|1
"""Escape from Hell"" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the ""fake plague"" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it."|1
"excuse me , but my tongue was too in my cheek when we filmed this piece o ' poop . "" "" it is your fault you did not enjoy the film . even though i thought it was incredibly exciting , all of the acting seemed to have been written by a total loser . one of the worst films in the history of blockbuster movies is this . i always hated this book . it was so terrible that every time i watched it , it made me sick with disgust . it was the worst thing that had ever happened to me in my whole life ."|0
"this movie has an outstanding acting , by marilia pera , and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine hector babenco . "" i love that film ! "" i can see it is a good book . i want to see it again when i live out in south america . its one of the coolest films i have ever seen . there are so many other movies on tv that i just have to check them all out . even if they are not nearly as interesting , i could always go to one of those shows with lots of action ."|0
What a crap that movie is. The script is simply non existent. The movie at times seems like a music video. But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this flick just killed me. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the guy?|1
"i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30 , 2006 and thought that it was even better . this movie was much better than the ones we have had over the last 20 years ( which is not very good at all ) . it was also a lot cuter . i looked at the scene from the film and saw that some of the people who worked there made fun of the movie . they said it was "" boring "" so why should i be surprised ? when you work in your job you expect something interesting to happen ."|0
"i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen . 219 minutes passed and yet , nothing changed . it was hard to believe that only 3 minutes had passed when the movie started . it was about a young girl who is being taken away from her parents on a mission against her own self . for a brief moment i wondered what would happen if we were able to save her . chapter 5 
 they took her from us as soon as we got back to the hotel . one of the most interesting films i have seen in years has come out over an hour ago ."|0
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus the death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola.|1
"It´s all my fault. They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the old TV-series. They were right. While production values are good and the actors themselves (including ""don´t look now"") Julie Christie aren´t that bad, the whole film displays a cheekiness and self-conciousness that clearly is without any justification. A comparison between the Karloff ""Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns 2000"" comes to my mind. In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series."|1
just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini - series , published in 1981 , is the story of a man who falls in love . not with his wife . not for the money . but for something more . something much more important . like the author and the characters . the premise is based on the idea that he must have been in love with an actress because when he meets her , they fall in love and get married together . it all sounds great , but if you look closely you can see that people are doing it wrong .|0
"This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. After a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.We are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. During this stage the film heightens tension with strange ""plinky plinky"" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing."|1
Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience.|1
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there.I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles.|1
i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise ; the sequels still surprise me . the third and most interesting thing to note about it is that it was edited first by a young man named ryan langevin , whom i met in an australian movie , but i did not know who he was . if you would like to watch the sequel ( which i have no idea what it 's about ) , then do n't miss this episode ! the characters are so simple they could 've just been made of glass , with a few pieces of furniture in each one .|0
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it.|1
"to my eternal shame , i ' ve never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire film . "" "" what is it ? "" asked the director , his voice cracking . 
 "" oh , it ' s so awful and horrible . if only it could be a reality show like this that would make people laugh . well , we ' ve seen at least two of them here in london . i really wish they didn ' t have to go through this much trouble , "" he said shaking his head with disbelief ."|0
This is a totally awesome movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler DDP would say; That's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women.|1
"what a shocker . for starters , i could n ' t stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . in fact , my life has been so dull and monotonous that i am beginning to think that it wasn ' t going to be quite long until i get a break . if i can make it through one day without being depressed , i do have a chance of getting another shot at a good life . unfortunately , this sucks as much as you would expect . chapter 11 : the meeting 
 the meeting had gone off without a hitch and now was the second coming of the mayor ."|0
Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it, as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. There was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it.|1
i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie . the way michael oliver who now lives in england acts like that is so scary , i do not care what the characters are or where they come from as long as there is nothing to make them feel any better about this movie . i ca n't tell you how many times i found myself sitting on this same couch thinking that i could get through this film with some sense of humor . i am almost ready to take a break when i have to sit up straight and look over at michael oliver .|0
I concur with the other users comment. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. If anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad.|1
i ' ll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent ' straight to video ' film , as it is highly considered an abomination and has no redeeming or good qualities to speak of . this film had a lot of bad influences on the movie , which is why i took it to see if i could ' t enjoy it . the premise is so unappealing that i ca ' t think of any better way to put it . what was the first thing i saw when i came into the theater ? there was something terribly wrong with this movie !|0
this is one of the best films i ' ve seen in the last years . belmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles , but how they manage to maintain a civil attitude towards each other during the whole film is beyond me . it was not at all funny either when the camera operator tried to take a photograph of them with his cell phone . there was no humor in the film . the director suggested that the film should be filmed within the past six months , because of its importance to the production of the next issue . this is an enormous mistake on the part of the director .|0
The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84).|1
i thought this movie ' d be totally different than just another teen - slasher . well i was totally wrong . there are some of the better comedies i have seen in the past and none of them were as great as this first one . i will never forget how disappointed my friends looked as we sat through the whole thing . they seemed to have gone from being shocked and not wanting to come forward with a plot line , to laughing like mad while watching it . what the hell was that all about ? why would you go to such extremes to look good on an old movie ?|0
Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when Buster orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty, Fatty makes Buster come back to pay, Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in Buster's hat and takes money, Buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, Buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on.|1
this was a excellent movie . i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching it in a way that ' s not all bad . as soon as the kid gets a good idea , he or she decides to take on the world with its own two paws . if you find yourself on the same planet as this kid and feel like you can ' t just watch him without his parents understanding why you have such a difficult time doing so , imagine what they must have felt when they watched this movie . those poor people who watched this movie were terrified .|0
this is only the fourth effort i ve watched from this director ( whom i met and found quite interesting ) ' s website . there are not many of these videos at all , but it looks like they have been taken by the very same people . i do not see how this movie can possibly be a good role to play in my movie . if you would rather watch this show , that is fine with me , but no , i will keep watching it . instead , i will continue watching the movie for one more time . i have decided to change the subject .|0
"It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman."|1
"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must."|1
My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit.|1
in terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen . the list goes back for several years and has been a total waste of valuable space . it could have taken me a year just to find this movie . if i knew any other cinematic writing i would have sold it . the only one that really matters to us are the stories about how the story was made up . we should make sure that our readers never forget the plot , which is extremely important . there are many things that i will miss about the history of the movie .|0
"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great! ""The King Of Queens"" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves."|1
"sony pictures classics , i ' m looking at you ! sony ' s got the rights to harry records - - you would know what that sound is , but it didn ' t seem to make any sense to me because it ' s just one of those things that have become so much a part of every movie . "" don ' t get me wrong , this film is quite good . the plot is beautiful and i can understand why some critics would want to put it there , but it ' s rather unimaginative . i really don ' t think it has any basis in reality ."|0
if i had to pick the most depressing movie , try to be suspenseful i ' ve seen it ' d be more fun . not as bad as that movie though . this was one of those late night comedy shows where you can ' t understand anything that was said , because there really wasn ' t any clear line of reasoning with what is being said . it seems like everyone is in a hurry to get away from each other ( but they don ' t even talk ) . people are so happy to be talking to their friends again , that they leave me alone and go about their normal routine .|0
"would be promising if it were a student film . never seems to know where it ' s going next , "" she added as she held the microphone up . "" i think this movie is about two people who make each other laugh and not even notice what is happening until after the fact . why do they go on seeing each other in places they never saw before ? does anybody have a favorite genre ? we can only hope that some of the films that are being produced will turn out to be nice ones and not bad ones ."|0
"I'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. Rather, I usually run out and see it (If I had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit A (So you can actually say something more than just ""McHale's Navy""). ""Mod Squad"" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking."|1
I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.I don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'.|1
i just saw this movie . i liked the soundtrack . i saw first the trailer and was magnificent , like all of the other films that i watched in the past few months . i felt a bit nostalgic for this movie , but my opinion of this movie was slightly different . it did not make any sense to me at the time , since they are made up of two separate worlds . as far as i knew , both versions were based on one of the main characters , but the plot is entirely different .|0
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says ""stay away from this movie"". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the worst movie I've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast-forward button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, ""The Cavern"" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like ""The Cave"" and ""The Descent""."|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
"barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport . she ' s not interested in this sort of thing and refuses to pay for it with her visa . the agent says , "" there is no way out of this little place but to get to work or leave . do you know where you are going ? "" he ' s looking at my passport . after a while he gives me one last look before i left the airport and takes off . i don ' t even notice his tail . it ' s hard to imagine what went wrong ."|0
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible. Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. Don't make the same mistake I did. The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can't pull it off. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines.|1
"Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in, from comic, to tragic, from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a ""talk singer"" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I."|1
with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie . but weber is good at his job , so i could not blame him for trying to save money on something he thinks will get him to write a better script . this is going to be a fun film , i can tell that for sure . when i was in college , there had been a band in the area and we started having an open mic night every week . the lead singer was a black man whom i thought was a great choice for the band , but instead he was a complete jerk .|0
lame rip - off of the quatermass xperiment ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - but a little entertaining , as well . i would rather watch a movie than to see the story with my own eyes . i can only say that if i had any friends back then it would be pretty cool . just wait until you see the movies in my life . i loved the ones that showed me how nice they were at the end . after seeing them on cable television , i would never have believed it .|0
okay , enough . every time i think i ' ve seen a film that is so misbegotten , so bad , it could never have happened , i look at it again and realize it has been one of the worst experiences of my life . this movie sucks ! it ' s not just some lame horror movie . in the movies we ' ve always found something very depressing about it , like how there is a lot of blood on the stage , but you do not find anything interesting about it . as if there are any words to describe the horror .|0
"i must say : out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out . it is certainly an interesting and quite good one . but , not to be taken lightly , that in the end it was a great movie . very disappointing , though . although you will have to look closer to see how it came to be called "" horror "" . as far as the actual genre of the movie goes , for example , the premise was pretty much predictable . while there is some positive action , most of it seems to take place just after death ."|0
if you like your films to pull your emotions out of you , if you like your films with a lot of drama , you have to play along as long as they keep you on the line for a while longer . ' ' thank you sir , it was a bit of a shock myself . ' i did n't want to tell the truth about how i felt . after all , it was my job to protect people from their worst nightmares . i really could use someone to help me forget that i was a horrible person who killed people . but what would be the point ?|0
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities. It's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.The movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product.|1
There's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. Hell hath no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo(Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami.|1
"seymour cassel gives a great performance , a tour de force . his acting as supposed washed up beach stud was more than he can remember and i have read this book before but i am still amazed how many of these people have been through the course of their lives and come out unscathed . i would say it is an impressive film . i was hoping it would be called "" the movie of my life "" , but we will never know for sure . in any case , i must admit that this film is not one of my favorite films so i hope you enjoy it ."|0
i ' ve seen worse films . this is bad but at least does n ' t try to be good so it doesn ' t seem to be a big deal . no , the show was one of my favorite shows ever . i ' m trying hard to remember if i won ' t enjoy it in this film because it ' s actually very boring . we ' re just about the only two people in the house that don ' t act like they belong on the same planet as each other , who are still living together despite everything .|0
I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.The Muppet movie is about how they all got started.|1
"if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical ( or torah ) portrayal of christ as a ' real messiah ' then i have no reason to trust you at all ! how could you be such a person ? your actions suggest otherwise . it 's just the fact that you are acting like this which is really disturbing . do you know where you 're going with this ? "" he asked me . his tone had become very serious , and i realized that i was sitting in my seat staring at him blankly ."|0
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies.|1
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.This movie's story line was onion skin thin.|1
This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.The characters are vivid and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novella. Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters.|1
"let ' s summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : arnold to antichrist : ` ` let ' s see if you can explain the most embarrassing moment of his life because it has an oversimplified ending . there is only one point where he says , "" here i am a man who was going to meet a wonderful woman and now we are going to run into each other . that ' s awful . why does my wife hate me ? she ' s a bitch and i mean that as a compliment . i have a feeling that some things were bad when they first began ."|0
"this film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to be easy , but that is just not true for them . they are told to do whatever they have to do in order to achieve this goal . i know that you can see what i mean . all it does is make them more curious and interested . if you want me to tell you the truth , i am not even sure that anyone will believe my words . let me go first . "" there was no way that i would listen to any more of these boring stories ."|0
i ' ve seen this story before but my kids have n ' t . boy with troubled past joins military , faces a terrible death and his girlfriend is killed in a boating accident as well . the poor guy is so shaken up that he has nightmares all the time . some nights he even sleeps alone . when he wakes up one night he has a full head of black hair except for a large bald spot on top . it would be cool to watch this movie . if you are a good writer you should probably get out and read your book right now .|0
"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love."|1
"Awful in a whole new way, ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a ""vanity"" production. I am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as Isabel Gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of ""lookers"" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie."|1
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!|1
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie. There's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations.It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the Illuminati. The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place.|1
the first feature - length adventure of jim henson ' s beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as kermit meier plays on the stage , but the audience loves it . i have seen all this so many times now that i can never remember when i started to watch it . i always wanted to watch it . i do not really like any of it and it just gets boring in a matter of seconds , which is not something that i had much interest in at the time , but for this particular story i would probably want to see it one more time .|0
"Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. I only watched ""Golden Temple Amazons"" yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers  especially Jess Franco ones  and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences."|1
the aftermath of world war two almost resulted in the death of soviet cinema . in the early years of the civil wars , however , when this film came along and was released , there was no reason for it to have a positive impact on all of the lives that were captured during its first year . i can understand why most people did not consider it a good career choice . my brother and i used to watch many of the movies together ( mostly ' 80s ) but he was always bored by the movie because it just seemed boring .|0
"Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable, and overacted. This movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of ""pee -wee"" sports.Characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.Did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.Typical ""Mafia"" behavior was boring and stereotypical.The dog, however, was so darn cute!!! !"|1
van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books , but i really do n't see what the point is of it if you ca n't use it for an action movie . i think i would have liked to see it because it seemed like a good idea before i read it all . however , i was not impressed by the movies that came out of these boxes and so let me say that i still prefer them as they are from the early ' 80s .|0
"What to say about ""Dead End Road""...Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, writing, effects, and everything in this movie was just horrendous. That doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had to sit through. That is also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally I didn't care what happened to the characters. I have seen bad but this was definitely the worst. I got hyped up for this because I am a fan of Poe and this was just bad."|1
In Sweet Water, the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as Bone Eater and their bones are devoured by the monster. The half-breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressed by Krantz to arrest the protesters.|1
in the 1940s , veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and mysterious allure . she also has a fan club that keeps up appearances by promoting her films . if you would like to share this with other people , please let us know what you want to talk about . we are not going to make an easy sell . i really hate to say this , but there are some very bad people around here who have been taking advantage of the women who are left in their underwear all day .|0
"Does anyone else think that ""Reba"" is basically a ripoff of ""Roseanne""? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who's married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor."|1
uwe boll slips back in his film - making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and their families , ending with the group being forced to kill one another on a whim . you may see this movie , but if you saw it before , or if you did n't see it before , then you must have viewed it after all . i will make sure there are no gory details that can be used to identify who is killing these men . here is one of the most gruesome scenes in the movie .|0
this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen , right from the start the movie goes straight down to the middle of the screen . i hate watching this . it was really bad . one minute everyone in the movie was talking and dancing and the next they all looked like they were being eaten alive . i could n't believe how bad the film was . not only was it bad but the actors were horrible . it just does not make any sense . i just do not buy it . i can tell that there is an awful amount of crap going on .|0
one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far : the story hesitates between a silly thriller that makes it hard for the audience to read , and an original film based on a documentary by robert heinlein . you ca n't help but laugh at the way he tries to make up this ridiculous story . there was nothing funny about this film . the only thing that bothered me was that the ending was so stupid that i could n't even get it over to the point where it made sense . the plot just is n't right and the dialogue is wrong and the lines are totally out of date .|0
` ` the apartment complex ' ' is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story . not to mention the fact that most of the shows on television are really boring . it does n't get better than this but it certainly makes me feel less guilty and more content . there is an awkward scene where the man gets shot in the head when the film is about to die , as if someone has gone into a movie trailer with a camera . what was so horrible ? i wanted to watch this movie with my girlfriends at the same time .|0
i have watched every version of this play that i can think of , including several on the stage , and i found myself laughing when it was over . the only reason i did not do a better job was because i had to watch this show for an hour or so without losing my composure . once again , i must say that this flick is one of the worst hits of my entire career as a film manager in the history of movies . i could not help but be amazed when i saw these two characters acting all wrong .|0
"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle ""adventure"". Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco!"|1
oh boy . where do i begin on this piece of slime ? this is one of the few real works of horror i have seen and i would like you to try to put it all in order because if you do , you are going to be disappointed . this is nothing short of horrifying . there is just no good way to describe it . it 's like a movie with lots of bad endings . this is an actual horror flick set in the middle of central american territory . the main character does not seem to feel the heat of anything .|0
"I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line ""I poked her with a stick. ""The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, dumb one."|1
"my grandad gave me this dvd . with friends like these . the front cover looked quite scary thought i wanted to get rid of that stupid movie . well i just went online and ordered it for a reason , "" you are such a jerk "" , or something along those lines . the film was not one - sided , but it made me really angry . i can see where people feel that way about what they have seen in the movies . i mean come on do n't tell me tv is not good enough to make them give up ?"|0
i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film , but with today it seems to be in an entirely different genre . i just want to let you know that i am very proud of myself for giving you the opportunity to do what you did this summer . there is nothing like doing something on tv to make someone laugh , especially when you have a good laugh . it makes me wish we could see more films . if you can read this , i think you will love the way it changes your perspective on the movie .|0
"In my analysis of ""Trois couleurs: Blanc"" I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of ""Trois couleurs: Bleu"". I think it's the same with this film. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness."|1
the revisionist history - - making the evil marquis de sade a semi - heroic romantic - - is mind - boggling enough . but the plot itself is so boring and depressing that i feel sorry for it . then , to make things worse , you can see how many of my best friends ' movies were comedies . one of which was the death of michael douglas . there were lots of examples of this movie being made at the hospital in chicago during the first year of its development . i mean , it was only a few months later when i met michael douglas .|0
during filming , was vanessa redgrave taking mogadon ? it was like she was reading from an autocue . i thought the movie would be hilarious - well , if you 're not a movie critic , maybe you should n't read anything at all . anyway , it 's just a bunch of pretentious people that are acting stupid and pretending to care about other people . i mean , what kind of person wants to have sex in this town , and who is paying the ultimate price for doing it ? so i did my job , and then i had to find a place to spend the night .|0
"There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. ""Meatballs"" was a leader. And here's one of its followers. ""Party Camp"" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that ""Meatballs"" (the original) had so successfully mined. Of course, that one had Bill Murray. So, what does ""Party Camp"" have?I'm glad you asked that question.Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish SHE provides!"|1
i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears . i guess i did n't know much about horror movies , but after seeing this movie , i thought that there must be a better way to deal with it . i loved the movie . i just felt sorry for the guy who starred in it . i wanted him to be an actor or something . as soon as he came on scene i jumped out of my seat ready to go home . as i was leaving class , i noticed a girl walking along the side of the street , trying to keep her head down .|0
I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, though. Maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime.|1
just what is the point of this film ? it starts off as one film , then changes track , and ends to show a series of events that you will never forget . when we came across this picture there was a lot of laughing around the room , but the funny thing was that i did n't feel like i was being laughed at . the whole thing started out great , but after watching the entire movie , i decided to take some time off to make a quick exit . i left the group for a while and went into the ladies ' washroom in order to get my composure together .|0
"i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie . i ' ve never grown tired of seeing it in theaters . i love the movie . it is not a bad movie . i don ' t like the actors , but they are really nice . it ' s actually a pretty cool movie . my favorite was the one called "" the american dream of america "" . it has lots of interesting plot twists that i thought i had seen before . when i watch it i always find myself wondering how it could be so realistic ."|0
red skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays wally benton who plays ' the fox ' on a radio station . i was watching this show for two weeks when it hit me : if you look into your future and see that it is not working out like it seems , then do something to change things . what do you want to do ? how did you choose to get involved with a tv producer ? what could you possibly say that would have changed your perception of yourself as a big star ? after all you were just a minor actor .|0
"I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes ""Legally blonde"" look like ""The Usual Suspects"" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie."|1
While not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys history.Basically, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brains behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie so what do you expect? Mike Love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius.|1
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while, and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It's never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed.|1
1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. Stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.|1
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it, I expected quite a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly.|1
"In terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, taking the side of ""the people"" against ""the nobles."" This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war."|1
Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's mildly amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. Whenever this comes on, I try to encourage my child to watch something else.|1
"it ' s not really about wine . no , nossiter ' s real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate into the industry . one can ' t do this without making a film or two , so how come you ' re here ? "" i shook my head . "" is that what this is all about ? "" she laughed , shaking her dark head . "" nope . i thought i ' d make some sort of fun of the people who came in here with us , but i ' ve heard plenty of things about this place ."|0
what a shocker . for starters , i could n ' t stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . it was hard enough to watch the same old stupid shows , but having people shouting at each other just to see how bad the show is makes me want to scream . this show had to have been horrible , and the only good parts that came of it were there was the fact that it seemed to be made in japan by an american film maker with lots of great acting skills who took his own life in an attempt to improve his craft .|0
the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play . the story is full of holes and twists that do not fit with the scenes in this novel . no wonder it was so easy to pick out the worst parts . but as i read it , i could n't help but notice that the plot was pretty basic . i watched the movie almost every night for some time . i never paid much attention to why it was good , just that i enjoyed watching it . then i thought , why me ? did i really know anything about hollywood ?|0
this movie is a great film . the movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film . driving to the movies ' point is like driving to a party where you will find some of the best and worst characters . i wish i could read that film . it would be so hard to keep track of what they say , because i have to watch them twice a day . how did this movie become about people and movies ? everyone seems very well - mannered , though i suppose there might have been a little more to it than that . then there was the whole dialogue .|0
Bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her?|1
` ` the quickie ' ' tells of a decadent russian mob family who lives in malibu and . . . well , frankly it could be worse . there are quite a number of people who call themselves russians , so perhaps it was just one of those many things . anyway , the film is very funny , though not overly interesting . . . and i hope you guys have a good day . if you find what i do interesting , please do n't let it ruin your fun . i 've seen my fair share of comedy films in my time , and i will make an exception for this one .|0
George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - he lopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful.|1
"actor turned director liev schreiber ( the sum of all fears ) does an above average screen version of the film , although it was not the best i have seen for a decade . this book is so far out there that i am certain it could have been made and sold to a lot of magazines without actually using the word hollywood . the title of this first movie has been based on the fact that it was written in such a way as to be almost unrecognizable . what the hell do you mean , "" fake "" ? why would a production company buy this movie and put it in my office ?"|0
down at the movie gallery , i saw a flick i just had to see . it looked like a horror movie for sure ; the plot is so cheesy you ca n't stand it ! all the characters are not bad looking , although they have some of the qualities that this movie would be good for . well , one thing i learned from watching this movie is that it is boring . i do n't know how anyone survives this kind of film , but i really think we should leave and find a nice quiet place .|0
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband."|1
A genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, its imaginative and genuinely gripping, but at the end its almost like Oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a rapid ending.The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together. But their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness.|1
with a title like that , you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter , the great artist , the great artist and the fantastic painter . so if you 're going to take part in these films , i suggest you have the guts to do some research on the idea of what he is doing and why . let your imagination run away with you , and make you wonder how you can ever create something like this . i 'm proud of the work you did , it was brilliant , and i wish it could have been made more from scratch .|0
in my opinion , the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing . the initial idea of having someone do something for you and that 's what i heard from the producers when they told me how awful this movie is . all i could see was a lot of ' fun ' and not much interesting dialogue . at the beginning of the movie , it looks like you will get a lot of good feedback from everyone else who takes part . however , as the credits come to an end , the audience starts to laugh . it is funny to watch people being so cruel , but there are no comedies on film .|0
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, Washington's is OK, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-stretched CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (Some Spoilers hereafter!)|1
A group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. They each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself.This not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie.|1
wow , i was told this would be a b movie worth watching . i feel that i was misled about the plot of this first movie because it is not based on much of any of the previous films i have seen in the last 50 years or so . this movie is totally different from any other we have seen in this part of the country . it seems as if there are only 2 main characters ( the man who is in charge of the screenplay ) . one is an extremely young girl with braces , another is a very cute little boy .|0
firstly , this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book , short story , novella , or anything that was meant to be funny . the characters are somewhat different than those i have worked with as a journalist for so many years , and i can see no humor in it . the only thing missing from this film is the plot , which has absolutely nothing to do with this movie ( aside from the way it is written ) . even when i find out that you made this movie because of some sort of character - related motive , i found it rather repulsive .|0
so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series , and had just watched parts 1 - 3 , which i think was quite entertaining . it is really not a very good movie ( this movie was actually a very bad show ) , but the plot is interesting nonetheless . there are no rules or rules in the movie ( at least that i know of ! ) because they all seem to be pretty stupid . if you have any kind of idea how many people can make a movie worth watching , please leave them alone ! i do not have to worry about anything .|0
this story starts at the end ! so the film ' s opening credits advise us . unfortunately that ' s not what really happens . i mean , it gets boring after a few weeks though , but then we are left wondering why there was nothing interesting on about the movie . do they really have a theme book with the characters acting normal ? who ' s going to give a crap if people act normal or not when you ' ve seen them before ? how could anyone believe that these people had been allowed to even be in this movie for the past eight months ?|0
the word ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli - danda ( as opposed to english , french , norwegian and spanish ) . this is really very boring but you can never tell by looking at it if it has any practical relevance . i also do n't mind letting you know that most of these things are not funny or interesting . they just happen to be sad stories from an annoying old man with too much money for his own entertainment . he would give his life for a couple of minutes ' worth of bad movies because he loved them .|0
With a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it.|1
When I first saw this movie, I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector(masterfully played by Elijah Wood)who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII. He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20-something, club hitting translator and his grandfather.|1
the genius that is stephen sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 ` ` musical thriller ' . he always wanted to be a star writer but could never find the time or the money and when he does it is so bad , so terrible . i tried to keep an eye on him as he developed his acting skills , but it became impossible . at first i thought that he was doing all the work because of his skill , but later i noticed that he wasn ' t trying to write anything . his style was pretty predictable .|0
jessica bohl plays daphne , the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school . daphne ' s parents have no idea how to handle this film . after witnessing the first two episodes , i am not quite sure how to handle any of this one . however , we can at least assume that it ' s a new story and will probably be a great time to make an impression . i wish i knew what the best movie was called or even where it came from . as a result , i don ' t understand the plot .|0
this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence . as a producer for an upcoming blockbuster , i got a lot of credit from the audience . you could tell i loved it because i watched it so often when they started showing it on my blog . however , there was no point watching it again now that i know i am not going to be around to enjoy it . even though i did enjoy the movie , i also enjoyed listening to the director ' s version of the good movies , which is one of the reasons i love this series .|0
In his feature film debut `Yellow,' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian-Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. However, in so doing, Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates Asian-Americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. The result? Dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch.Don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `Yellow'; each falls into one of two camps.|1
this movie was really funny . the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy , should get a chance to see it on tv . also , the story and characters all seem to be different . i have seen these films before but i never expected to see another one of those movies . i had been watching them for a couple weeks at my house when i found out that the movie was being produced by a film company in germany . there is just nothing funny about this movie . the title of the movie is unpronounceable - you ca n't read german unless you want to ( which i do ) .|0
what a wonderful film , filled with eccentric , unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast . the first one was a little disappointing . not because there is nothing special about any of the characters in it , just that the acting was lacking . as i recall , this movie was not exactly original . why do so many people think that it is the best thing that could have happened to them while they were doing it ? well , for some reason , the producers want to make it seem like an easy movie . they want everyone else to be convinced that something terrible is happening .|0
As we are well aware, movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history, but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation. I wish the director and/or the screen writer had done his/her research in this topic. All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a rift that should not be there. This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while making the third group (Hindus) look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations.|1
i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance . i ca n ' t imagine any of the others having seen this kind of film - let alone had the foresight to see this kind of film , and it could have been so easily taken down by the tv . there was something else that made me think this movie was meant to be a crime scene . as far as i can see , the first two scenes were all about cops . however , once again , not only did this film not lead to any arrest or anything , it was completely predictable .|0
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good !!! Thought it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying. This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out scenes of course, to keep any horror buff like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good IMO. Even though its not a high budget movie, the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes. Worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure!|1
the best so - bad - it ' s - good movie ever made . rudy ray moore is my personal hero . whether dealing with day to day life on earth , i ' ll always love him . he is everything i would never have thought a clone could be but he looks just like larry king . larry king was great at his career in acting as director of a blockbuster comedy that took place in 1976 . he loves his work and has earned a lot of awards from various roles . he is one of the most likeable characters i have ever seen .|0
i do n ' t really know why so many persons love this movie : maybe it ' s funny , ok , but the way it is shown on the tv screen and the fact that none of its scenes even remotely funny . you ' ll just sit back and stare at those two movies in silence with a blank stare . no humor whatsoever . which is totally understandable because we are not looking at the same shit as the rest of the world . i wish i was one of those actors who can ' t wait till they see this film and actually enjoy it .|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. Luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. A hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house.|1
With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog).|1
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work.|1
well it is a good movie . however , you have to admit that van dame ' s movies have n ' t gotten much action and i can ' t understand how she ended up with such a bad story . in any case , i ' ve seen some really bad movies but this is the best i ' ve seen them all . i would love to see van dame ' s movies again one day . just thinking about it makes my head hurt so much i don ' t even remember watching it when it was first run out of print . it ' s awful .|0
It's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It's not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this one is a turkey.|1
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.Quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. I won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.The movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly.|1
there ' s a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee . the bimbo in the office is also a good model , but it ' s one of the reasons i don ' t find this material very interesting . if you just don ' t like the woman with the bad legs for example , what would be the point of putting on that skimpy bikini and taking a hot shower instead ? it ' s obvious they didn ' t care much for each other , even after only meeting for five minutes last week .|0
well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes about doing . while it was very good , the premise is a bit more than mildly unrealistic in some respects . for one thing , most of the characters are based in places such as texas , new york , los angeles , chicago , denver or san francisco . but for another , there are some interesting scenes which you will find on the internet here that you would n't expect to see in a movie . i have never seen so many films in my life .|0
first of all , just let me say this . . . ghost story . . . . hello ! ? ! if any of you would care to hear one of the characters ' names please do so . it was a good night and with all the wonderful things that have been happening recently in my life . . . . i thought that i should put it out on the news . . . some of the characters are getting killed or even maimed because they tried to take over the country . . . well , i suppose it could have been worse but the worst part is about to happen .|0
while caricatures and / or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in films , magazines , books , or movies . i will take no credit here . this is the product of a documentary that was seen at an amateur film festival in 1994 . it was also released as part of a story about an american actress who got dumped by her former boyfriend after trying to seduce him . apparently she has a lot of bad moments when she tries to ' accidentally ' get involved in a relationship with him . all of which were made up years ago .|0
created by dennis spooner , ' department s ' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol , based on a very strange group of people who worked in the united states government . one story was about a young boy being abducted from a house in new york . he had been working for them for several years and felt it important to keep an open mind about their work . the movie came out in 1947 and made its way into the limelight at the british embassy in central london , but after four months of trying they eventually gave up with the film and sold it .|0
this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie ' s work , a lifeless , muddled mystery . here are some of the best parts i have yet to see , mainly because they are not shown at all ! in fact , i have no idea what they could have been made from . but there are a lot of great movies that come out , which you just ca n't really blame a person for . the movie is lame , and it makes me feel guilty , as if i stole it . i would much rather have known about it , but i felt like it was a failure .|0
"The inspiration for the ""Naked Gun"" movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like ""Airplane!"" and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving.It's too bad that the show only had six episodes."|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. Recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced Merchant Ivory-type features. I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain.'|1
I can't really criticize this film. It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. The acting is on a high level.|1
"when i reviewed the video for a local magazine , i called it ` ` the greatest achievement in the history of the universe ' . we have to go back about 2 minutes to take this film away from its previous purpose . the first thing you learn is that sometimes you can get people to say "" great , wonderful , fantastic , great , wonderful ! "" and the second thing you learn is that even if you say "" great , wonderful "" you know it was just an echo . there is nothing quite as good as a "" great , wonderful "" movie ."|0
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.On this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are.|1
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class.|1
i have never seen this in the theater , my second viewing was tonight on big screen dvd as opposed to this one . but it is the opening credits of the movie that really upset me . there is something about this movie which does not look natural to me . it has a very realistic quality . i can see where someone with experience would be attracted to this piece of art and could also see why it had been set up here . however , the overall premise seems to be rather lacking in reality . the acting is awful and the plot is atrocious .|0
I am very impressed by the reviews I've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball.|1
A MUST SEE documentary.-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client.|1
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical.|1
` ` christmas in connecticut ' ' is an absolute gem , and a must - see for christmas ! elizabeth lane , a novelist , loved it very much . but there was also the story of one of her friends having a falling out with this guy ( she knew he was gay ) . i can only imagine how horrible that must have been . we had to make a movie about the girl from ohio who lives in chicago . you know how it is when a friend goes off by himself and meets this guy and falls in love with him ?|0
I find it amazing, that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). OK, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-Poles. Screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - awful. It's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. P.S.|1
"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep."|1
No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc.|1
larry bishop , the writer / actor / director , focuses too heavily on the camera , music , and visuals . the film is a work of this author . in my opinion , it is ridiculous . for one thing , what sort of movie is it ? i could n't even think of one because i wanted to avoid being filmed . that was the first time i actually looked at the script . why are there two sets of characters that make you feel as if you are watching a show rather than a movie ?|0
when i first saw this movie , i had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset , but it was n't . this movie has always been good and even if i do say so myself , most of the time i just wish i was watching something else . there is no reason why this thing could n't be good . well , in this film , the woman is not being attacked . she is being abused by her captors . the kidnapper tries to kill her . however , the man who raped her seems to be doing the opposite of what he intended .|0
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.|1
i completely understand why this movie was made . silence of the lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome one , no surprise - and it seems to be over when the main character is released in 2013 . so how are we supposed to know if it is even true ? perhaps it should be a mystery movie but it seems too horrible to be real . you can imagine the confusion that ensued when people realized what their lives were being built on . first of all , the plot does not make any sense . there must be some reason why this movie was made .|0
when the legends die is a powerful , moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become a tribal leader after killing his family . i think the only reason this story is still here is because the story is so interesting . in fact , there were some interesting parts , but it was such a small thing that we did n't really care . the most important part was the time he killed his family . it does n't help with the murder of his son and sister - in - law . i found it hard for me not to laugh at the irony of what i had just seen .|0
if christopher nolan had made memento before following , then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected . there were only a few men who knew about these films , which are not what they should be . i never really believed that one would go through the trouble of watching this kind of film in order to keep his job , and was surprised when i saw the reviews . i read the reviews with great interest and found out that none of them were bad , because some of the characters themselves were not even very good .|0
"There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you have some idea of what these two are like. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once."|1
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want.|1
i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director ' s new movie . i ca nt believe how difficult and confusing everything was . that is until it happened in the first episode , which really sucked . as part of the filming , there were four people on stage and they all ended up killing themselves . we did not know any zombies existed , nor did the other movies . when i saw one of the characters die , i thought it might have been from a brain tumor . then again , the movie could have been from a mental institution .|0
almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor . geena davis is a schoolteacher in chicago when her husband gets sick and she arranges for this to be his last trip to the dentist . i was wondering why he did not go first . maybe he thought he would do better as a writer , then he just had to keep trying . it was actually kind of sad when i saw the movie . it was obviously a bad film by most people , but if you read the reviews where you read them , it would be a real disappointment .|0
"this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school , early high school age kids . "" it looks great , "" i agree as i watch for an hour . after i finish my movie i pick up some dvds and spend the next five minutes on the floor trying to see what 's so important about the movie . there really is nothing more interesting than someone watching a movie without making any kind of attempt to do something else . i am not really a fan of movies , although i like the action in them very much ."|0
you know i only watched 15 minutes of this film , so i ca n ' t really describe how great it is , but the first time i saw it was in one of the movies . a friend and i had a huge dinner at the house . i could n't take my eyes off of the movie and i wanted to sit around and watch it for about 10 minutes or so . then we sat in the living room and watched this movie . that was the second time in less than 10 minutes that i have seen something like this on a tv show .|0
i saw this title again on shemaroo . i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same movie and he said you were 18 ! it was amazing . it made me feel like a big dork for not thinking about all the things we had to do . i 'm a bit of an ' 80s dweeb in those days but i got over it quickly . so what did you guys see in that movie ? it was funny . really funny . no pun intended . even though it was awful , i just could not picture myself watching something like this anymore .|0
"Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes."|1
ok , this movie was n ' t good at all . video games are n ' t what i would brag on if i were you , and the only one who got a decent story was steve jones . i watched it once and it really hurt me . after watching it for quite some time i finally gave up trying to understand why someone would want to have so many bad movies made . it seems pretty pointless to watch as much as it did . there is a small part of me that just wanted to see it again . however , i learned something about being poor in this town .|0
the merchant of four seasons was rainer werner fassbinder ' s first shot at mainstream acceptance . in a turbulent career as a reporter / writer , he has had little to say about his fellow actors and publishers . however , if you are interested in opening this novel , i am very much hoping for some feedback from you . i know that you have a good job , but please keep your eyes off the television . it is too much like watching a movie where there is no entertainment . i hope you will find it entertaining .|0
i found this an awfully disappointing experience ! but i have appended a better option of similar style at the same time that i am looking forward to getting out of your life . i can not help but wonder why we are in such good shape . for example , all those films on the internet that say : it will be easy to get away with having sex with people who are only 15 years old and have never done it before , which explains so much about this film . i think i see what you were thinking . the movie is horrible .|0
produced by nott entertainment , this movie is ` ` nott ' ' very good at all . i sat through the entire segment , including the parts where she was in the audience . i just ca n't believe what a big deal it is for her to come up with this kind of film . i can understand why people would buy this kind of thing . i know there is not much else to do in hollywood but watch this movie and listen to the soundtrack . i love movies like this . they make everything look so fun .|0
most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt , although that some found it slow or painful to write down was not the only part i thought about . what a bunch of morons ! my first novel , the new yorker , will never have made it to the top of the shelf . i had hoped that i would someday get around to doing it and i know that i have , but i was actually disappointed at how little progress i was making . this is not a bad book , really ; there are lots of errors in the storyline but overall they all sound fine to me .|0
the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript . i do n't understand how they would have known about that , but they did make it credible . if only i were allowed to go and see a little more of this book , i would just enjoy reading what it was really about . the whole time i was getting used to the genre as it was being released on amazon i was wondering what else there was to see . at first glance , i thought it was a film about some great movie that had seen a long way through .|0
"This is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, did in fact have more laughs. This, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet ""Yahoo Serious"" so I could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. There is also very few things to say about Australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit."|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. Like one of those so-so episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has Something Important To Say.You'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. However, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!|1
One of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope.|1
"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation."|1
it ' s the 1980 ' s and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is on fire . there ' s lots of screaming and shouting . i don ' t think the movie really was that bad , more like a good movie where the only thing you can do is watch the show and get bored . anyway , the whole scene is about some guy trying to steal a bunch of money out of his friends ' wallets after he beats them at a gaming convention . how could people not understand this ?|0
if you loved the 1993 ( erotic , sci - fiction ) cyborg film ` ` nemesis ' ' , then you ' ll love this movie . the characters are extremely good at portraying themselves as heroes . they are in all sorts of trouble and the plot has to be different from any other movie i have ever been involved with . this one is about a super spy , whose job it is to save people from bad guys . she gets kidnapped by them . when she comes to their house , her parents get mad at her because they think she will tell them something that will put an end to evil .|0
Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother.|1
"Formulaic to the max. Neither title reflects the serial's actual content, ""Fighting Nazis in Morocco,"" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too."|1
first the premise stinks . . . little boy likes to dress in girls clothes . it reminded me of norman bates . i saw the film a week ago when this film is made and decided to watch it in my hotel room . i was just making sure i would not be too bored , so i went outside to get some air . i noticed a few people walking around the streets . they were all dressed in tight black leather pants and white shirts . what kind of guy dresses up as a clown and tries to have fun in a strip club ?|0
this movie was much better than i expected . + + + + jean peters actually does a passable job as a pirate ' s wife . she is , without a doubt , the hottest actress in the whole book . it is one of the most disturbing stories i have ever heard . at the end of that film , we find out that jean has never had a serious relationship with anyone besides the husband and he is so jealous of her ( though he does not admit it to himself ) that he beats her up almost every night .|0
i love this show . i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the movie comes on , which i would imagine is about a few years from now . and then i remember why i have n't seen my old tv show since high school . i never had much of the time for television . there was too much to do or even watch . nothing in my past was exciting enough . i never really cared one way or the other who i was living with . i just wanted to be normal .|0
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults.|1
"one of the most successful shows in television history is back . now i admit i never got into the whole action movie thing , and i did hope for a different ending but there was none . they just kept on playing it out like an episode of the twilight zone . at least that was what i tried to tell myself when i saw it . "" we will see "" was my line of thinking . "" do you know this movie ? well , i watched it once . it was great . it looked like it was going to get better and better by the day ."|0
For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.Bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!|1
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."""|1
what is this ! ! its so bad . the animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 ' s version of a film . i was hoping you liked it , and i am sure that if i had been looking at it when it came on , i could have bought a copy . it was n't as bad as most movies where it takes place from one point to the next , which is good because i do n't have any time to read it . in some cases it does take place with the protagonist ( or movie director ) lying unconscious in the grass .|0
what can i say about a movie as bad as this ? the people who made this movie , did not make me like it . i have never been very popular in school and now that i am out on my own with one of my favorite authors , i feel like i will be disappointed if i do not get some good action - movie reviews . i know there is so much fun to be having in this genre but i just ca nt think of any more fun to be having in this genre . oh well . i want to hear more about this new horror series .|0
"i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival . this is the first indian film i ' ve seen in all my life , and i don ' t even have an actual recording of it yet . let me start by asking who made it and where did we go to get a copy . "" "" oh really ? "" "" you can ' t keep your eyes off them , can you ? one of the main reasons they ' re great films is because their portrayal has always had a low impact , but they ' re also pretty good when compared to other movies ."|0
why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation ? the whole ` ` complete jane austin ' ' series as if this film should be made at the same time and the characters seem to be all alike ' has done no better than that . you can see why it would be so terrible to watch it . there is an incredibly long list of films in every genre , but one of them looks like it will never get over its past failures . i think my father was afraid it would take up to forty years before any new movies came out ( and he was right : there are only ten ) .|0
Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism to the core. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic.|1
one of my desires is to be a film - maker , and i just have to say there ' s no way i would have been able to pull this off . as you can imagine , i was totally out of place on the set and felt like being a bit too much of a wuss to try and be a good actor . but with time , i got some good acting jobs , and in the meantime , i made myself an easy mark . if i ' m really lucky , i could actually become a real movie star . well , maybe not such luck .|0
i do not find this show at all funny . i actually think it is much worse than any of those movies i am used to watching , and there are more episodes than i expected . this movie was a big deal for the first few chapters . the only problem is that i can not read the whole story . on the other hand , if you look at one of my movies , you would see how far the plot takes to make sure you have n't missed out on a bit of action and intrigue . i have never heard of these films but they have been popular before .|0
barbershop 2 : back in business was n ' t as good as it ' s original but was just as funny . the whole thing was a piece of cake , i did n't care that there is no way this movie could have seen more than five seconds of action . i can ' t even recall the film being very interesting to begin with . there are so many scenes that don ' t make much sense . if it didn ' t , it should have . i really don ' t think anyone would like to see this movie anyway .|0
our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film ( except note that it needs to be used in a number of parts so that the author can find out what kind of person is acting ) . and when i saw it as an interesting book , i thought i was just being sarcastic , but later on , i think i started to look at it with a bit more interest . maybe if i had learned more about the movie after reading it , perhaps i would have been able to put my thoughts into words !|0
i have to agree with the previous reviewer . although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the hero / villain character , it took him a while to get the cast to pay attention and act . after he started talking to them , they stopped listening to him . i can honestly say that i never felt more alone . i could not even find someone who would help me , or anyone who knew me well enough to take my case . this was the worst movie i have ever seen . no one really listened to me for more than a second and then everyone just left .|0
"If you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy ""You Are Alone"". It is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness."|1
i first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 , i dismissed it offhand as a joke . the original premise was very silly , with a few jokes , but that was only because i had to read the chapter for the first time . if you are looking for something witty , the movie is pretty much like most of the movies i 've seen since becoming an adult . when i saw the book and realized how boring it was , i just laughed . i do not care what people say about me or my genre , but it is funny .|0
movies are n ' t always suppose to be about deep , provolking thoughts . sometimes they ' re simply meant to be a way to distract you from the pain of your own mind . if i couldn ' t read , i ' d say it was written by one who hadn ' t seen a movie in at least three years . what i learned was that some people don ' t even know they can do this , and they could only imagine how awful it wouldn ' t be . not everyone would enjoy the experience as much as me .|0
"I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.This is an ""A"" movie and I recommend it highly. If you liked ""1984"" book or movie, I think you will like this one as well.This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach."|1
hard to believe - but it is ! i should n ' t be surprised . commercials try to show how unique a film that is . at one point you see the opening scene and you just know there was a story behind this , especially with the actors ' names and faces in them . the first thing you learn about the characters is that they are not what they appear on the screen . they are not exactly what they appear on tv , either . the dialogue is very funny , like someone who has seen too many horror movies .|0
"This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, ""Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?"" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo."|1
Being a fan of the series I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What's with that dance scene??? The only reason I didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny.|1
a team varied between scully and mulder , two other scientists , a pilot , and the guy who plays as a cameraman . the story is based on something like this - it involves a man in a dark suit looking at a screen that was just switched over to an active tv program . when he turns off the tape , all of the footage goes to some kind of game or show , where one person shows up to get shot . i do n't know why the guy is getting shot in the first place .|0
"I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. This The Fantastic Four film, complete with the I-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue ""Kill him!...Let him go!"" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides."|1
"The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as ""beyond belief!"" ""no words can express how I feel about this"" ""This movie will move you"" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie."|1
"ninja hunter ( aka wu tang vs ninja ) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous premise : 
 the japanese have a plan for revenge . they plot their attack in a very specific way ; this is one of the most horrible and disgusting examples that can be made in hollywood movies . the japanese know nothing about the true intentions behind these murders . according to the script , the japanese are ruthless killers who kill without remorse . it is almost as if they intend on killing everyone in the country . they are trying to build a false image of the tokyo police force ."|0
A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). Tracking the killer to his home, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick.|1
i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan . i figured it could n ' t be that bad since i watched it last year . as a matter of fact the entire episode was really good , but i guess you ca n't blame the actors for not following what they are doing and seeing where things would take them . i was very much disappointed at the end . i think i may have made myself a bit uncomfortable watching it . even the characters seemed to be taking part . there were some funny scenes and jokes , but mostly the acting was mediocre .|0
Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. And I have more good news.|1
the third film i got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from japan . after a week of watching the same movie over and over , we had decided on this film because it did not really have a shot that would go down as expected . it is pretty hard to understand why someone would take such great photos when they should be producing something more impressive . in fact , the only person who takes great photographs of me is ken leong . although he is very good with his hands , he just does not pay attention .|0
this is the second movie about 1985 , the other one was ' the wedding singer ' . whilst the ' wedding singer ' did appear in the film , it was not quite the way i expected . there is no point in trying to explain things to you . if you think you can help with the story because of the premise , then go back and look at this movie from an original perspective . however , this movie is much better than that . the plot is far less interesting , the characters seem more sophisticated and even the dialogue is better than yours .|0
i still count ` ` police squad ! ' ' as the absolute funniest tv show of the 1980s . somewhere , though , there must have been something about this movie . it was certainly not like what my other shows are doing here on earth right now . for one thing , they made me sit down in front of a television screen and take a photo with a camera so that no one would know what i was seeing when i came on stage . but being a young man , i liked this movie - i really enjoyed it - but i never expected to be watching it .|0
there ' s something going on in this film directed by x - files scribe john shiban that has eluded me . you know , he is really good at what he does . so , i want to see this action film ! it ' s not exactly the kind of film you ' ll be expecting from a modern production studio . and i didn ' t pick this movie out because it was too late . i selected the film because of its premise , but i wanted to make it seem more like a romantic comedy . the director was much more difficult than his predecessor .|0
"There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something I found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, ""Smoooooookin!"" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe?"|1
and one of ' em are bad movies . the title , as it turns out , refers to a killer who gets murdered by a bunch of cops who want to kill him and his family for some stupid reason or another . the movie has been on dvd for about four hours . i was in the mood for a nice late - night walk around town , but then i saw this movie and just thought i would have some time to myself . after all , i was going to be writing that book for a couple of weeks anyway so why not get off my butt now ?|0
just in case the title did n ' t give it away - this movie is garbage . short review ? yeah . i decided to go a little wild with the first two movies i wrote . they are not quite as good as the films i originally got , but i have always liked this film . if you like this movie , then please see it on smashwords.com . i hope it gives you an idea of what some of my best films are made of . i love them so much that when i looked at one i was tempted to put it back in its box .|0
Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, 'The Golden Lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later, far superior work.|1
a fairly interesting look at some characters from india ' s burgeoning middle class . although india is rapidly modernizing , it ' s just not as fast as we ' ve seen the film . i ' m sorry to say this movie is being revamped , but i think there ' s only a few good comedies and they don ' t do very well . in any case , when the director ' s name was made public it ' s funny that he has no idea about the film or the characters . after all , his whole life was taken away from him by the media .|0
there seems to have been some money behind this film , but it would be impossible to imagine a film that could lead to such a huge change in the public image . i do n't really care about what sort of people are out there or even who they are ( and why ) , as long as they do n't get stuck up there doing whatever they want . i am very disappointed when i discover that no one actually gave a damn about this movie . i was so used to being with my friends like we are now , that i did n't realize just how many people had wanted to see this show .|0
well , i did n ' t know what to expect from 555 . matter of fact , i had never even heard of this movie . i have no idea why anyone would go to this kind of effort to get in the films . there are too many people out there who are just looking for some action , something that is really not there anymore . it 's like they want a little excitement and adventure . as soon as they see this movie , they will turn off all the light in their house , and when they do , everything is dark .|0
after missing out on this innumerable times on tcm uk , i decided to check it out given its sci - fi / adventure / camp experience , which is somewhat disappointing because i had the opportunity to write a few short chapters about this place and my hopes are that i can find something interesting to occupy my time now that i am done with this job . maybe i would have been better off if i had gone to texas . the story is as depressing as the stories . i really enjoyed the novel , even though i was only trying to make some money in the process .|0
yes , i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill ! julie has always wanted to do something like this , and i am not going to let her down . we have a date on saturday night at seven o'clock in the morning , and as far as i can tell she has already made plans to spend the day with me . it will be all right . i really wish there was more i could say about her , but it is a good story for another day .|0
Well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end. It has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. Nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.|1
pilot mitch macafee ( jeff morrow ) sees a ufo while test flying a plane - - but nothing shows up to verify that . as far as he can figure , it does n't exist . this movie is not very much of a show - in fact i had hoped it would have been a little better . after reading the first paragraph of the film i am surprised how many people know about this and what their involvement is in this project . it is one of the most interesting films i have seen so far and there are some amazing characters on every page .|0
this rendition of ` ` noah ' s ark ' ' has set hallmark ' s ( and turner ' s ) reputation back about three years . i thought the story would be very interesting . it has a great range of plot lines , but there was never that much excitement to it . what 's really surprising is that it didn ' t come across any problems in the novel . for example , one night , we were having a sleepover at the movies . it ' s an odd thing to have someone you ' re friends with do something so silly .|0
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance).|1
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series.|1
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction.|1
naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film , the other two being ozu and a friend of mine who came up with the idea . ozu is from japan , he has recently retired from playing for the australian tv team and has spent his entire existence in australia . we are all extremely fond of ozu . ' ozu ' is not just good looking , or even handsome ; he is a wonderful actor to watch as a young boy . however , when i was about fifteen , i found out that ozu had a daughter ( she is quite beautiful ) .|0
"this is the best direct - to - dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet . van damme plays a border collie , which works out perfectly . there 's nothing too funny about the dialogue . you might think van damme would be great as a lead actor in any film but van damme is not . he tries to act just like the rest of the actors , trying to do his job with an ' average "" normal "" person and not get stuck on top of a very dangerous project . he tries to talk to people through his voice ."|0
This movie was sooo bad. It wasn't even funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who Chris has eyes for.|1
"Writer & director Jay Andrews, a.k.a. Jim Wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-Z computer generated reptiles in ""Komodo Vs. Cobra,"" as generic a rip-off of ""Mysterious Island"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" as you can imagine. The chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilariously awful. However, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable."|1
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today!|1
It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. To this end he has made an excellent, objective film. Spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech Amercians and auld-Europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.Nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means.|1
What is this!! its so bad. The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. I sat through all of this film an then at the end I was annoyed when I realised I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD? A girl got shot?! What is up with that, it was just a stupid film.|1
in case you dear readers never heard , this movie was the main inspiration for last year ' s samuel l . it did make a great film and i know that some of you are wondering if i would have had an interest in it at all , but i am glad to say not . it was a nice plot with a few very bad actors who tried to portray what they thought happened when they were in high school . i enjoyed it very much and watched it with my friends many times while going out to dinner with my family .|0
"this movie is on cable sporadically , and i never really watched it , thinking it would be similar to the horror movie i 'm always watching . well , apparently not . my favorite was a very bad action - adventure movie called "" love shack "" that took place in southern california during the civil war . the story was basically a man who lives in a small town in florida ( he has a ranch ) with a couple of daughters . after the wife gets bored and comes back home , they get married , have lots of kids , and then live in the house for the rest of their lives ."|0
solo is a poor film - that can not be ignored . the acting for the most part is very mediocre . the only problem is that the movie is bad , and i see no reason why so much of this film has any meaning at all . we have to understand the actors , and they must understand their role . it is not the greatest film ever made , but at least it is entertaining . maybe there are some good things about this movie , like being able to get up and walk away from a murder scene .|0
"Like a lot of people, I loved the original; ""American Graffiti"" was one of the great movies of the 70s. The sequel, ""More American Graffiti"" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. It wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as ""Laurie's"" character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and ""Terry the Toad"" and ""Pharaoh Joe"" somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam)."|1
"i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good , and i watched a video on it . "" i shook my head as we walked to class . i had never seen any of this stuff before , so how could i ? it was just like everything else . there was nothing interesting or interesting about the film in the first place , but from the way he was looking at it , i thought he was going to pass out at any minute . i really wanted to hear him tell his story . however , he would not say what made him want to do this story ."|0
many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance . i went from suspended disbelief to anger in one short period of time . i do n't know how many times i have been that way before . it seems as if my emotions are still too new and impressionable for me to accept any of this . maybe they were not all like that , but certainly the actor is good . what an amazing movie . i was really hoping for a more dramatic ending , but the plot was so badly made i 'm not sure what else to say .|0
i ' m not bothered by the sleazy hosts , nor am i bothered by the cynical , self - righteous stance the people of this time have put on in their speeches . i don ' t see how it has to make any difference since the same kind of actors are always doing what he ' s doing . as a matter of fact , i think there is something else going on here but i ' ve got nothing to know about it . i really want to get back on track with my story , and i ' ve been watching that movie for quite some time .|0
absolutely the most thoughtful , spiritually deep , intense hamlet ever done - - no other version comes close . jacobi 's dialogue was like that of an actor from a movie : i should be afraid to take liberties with my characters . but you and i both know that this film is very real and has been produced in many small theaters over the past fifteen years . if you feel you have to get involved or even see this movie , go ahead . when it comes down to it , i do n't mind watching a movie , but i want to make sure the action is not too bad before taking it .|0
this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland , who died of cancer in 1990 after four years of a horrible disease . she never saw her brother or sister again after that episode . i would not know how it felt for me to watch the movie and be disappointed in the outcome . it just seemed so awful . i am trying to think of many reasons why i liked this movie but nothing comes to mind other than the fact that the character could n't even keep up with what she was doing .|0
this one ' s as cheesy as they come the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already pretty bad , i think the only real difference from the movie is that there are multiple parts in the film and some scenes are too realistic for my taste . the acting is excellent , the plot is not so great but it all worked out better than i ever thought it would . i hope no one else does this to me , because i really like being able to share with people about my life . i also hope no one seems to care too much about anything related to space - time travel .|0
"i have read almost all the books by now , and have seen the musical production in two different languages . i never realized that such a series of "" movies "" were necessary for a writer to remain alive . as you can probably imagine , however , it does n't help your situation either . not to mention the fact that if you really think about it , it is not quite the same thing . there is no way that this could ever get any less scary than a horror flick with an ending like this . but what the hell ?"|0
"A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope that's what they were going for because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been."|1
"i can only say this : ee03128 from portugal , i could n ' t say it better . the worst movie of my life is based in spain , which is a lot to take in . we got ta make a conscious effort and find a reason to love that movie . the first person to read the story would be one of their friends , someone they loved dearly . if you have never seen this movie by the author then you would n't understand the meaning of the words "" no "" and "" yes "" or "" no "" ."|0
this show started out okay , but then it turned into a nightmare . the worst part about it was that none of the people they were watching were even remotely likable . so when we went to see it , i thought i 'd feel better about it after watching it . i was disappointed as hell by the time we left . i just wanted to get out of there in one piece . i know now that it was a bad idea . it looked like some kind of sci - fi movie , but really it was just an attempt at showing you guys that you are not allowed to look at other people .|0
"This film is just as bad as ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"". I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast.I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news."|1
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card.|1
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I guess I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes.These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick?|1
most of chaplin ' s most famous films are his full - length features . and , i assume most people have at least half an imagination about what a film might look like when it is viewed from the outside . how he got that one was beyond me . he did n't know that this movie was based on real movies , because no one had ever heard of them . i am not so sure that he even knows how to get a movie straight out of the internet , which i do not blame him for having done .|0
if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see this movie a lot less than i would have . when i was a little kid , i did my homework at home for the entire day and it made me mad . of course , i still get angry whenever someone mentions it , even though they do n't actually mention anything in their movies . as a kid , i got bored with watching the same old boring movies over and over again just to watch some good old western .|0
"The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only ""star power"" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. Someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin."|1
I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it.|1
"Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said ""leave it alone."" Why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 ""Psycho,"" I don't know. My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialog was the same and the story the same.On one hand, I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film."|1
just finished watching 2ftm . the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend . this was one of those shows where you have to take an interest or do a lot of staring because someone is in there doing something really bad . the director of the film said that it was supposed to be a ' good idea ' , but the plot was a little off - script . this was a great movie for a short film . i like the premise and i especially liked the plot as it was different from how it was before we started seeing it .|0
dodgy plot , dodgy script , dodgy almost everything in fact . the most compelling performance is that of joanna van gogh , who plays a girl who disappears and is found dead in a lake . her death must be reported to the local police because they must investigate this story from their own sources and make it credible . i am not good with characters , so i can only recommend one other film i would like to try . it seems to be made for an older woman who finds herself locked up in a cave ( where she was killed ) . it 's very dull .|0
dictated by thin experience ( of both life and industry ) and no cash sofia coppola ' s early short is a classic example of how good things are in this era . the idea to create an alternative world for people , like the one in 2001 , is laughable . it is a brilliant concept and i love it so much that i ' m tempted to write it - but i fear if i go out there now , everyone will look at me and think : ' what do we make of her ? who is she ?|0
i ' m just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon . i ' ve seen only 4 movies but they were awful . for example , all of them showed a very handsome man with beautiful blonde hair who had an extremely long beard . he did not really look good and it made me feel ashamed . at the same time , i am thinking that this film should not have been any of my favourite . it was supposed to be the best in the world , even if the acting was a little bit off - beat .|0
"""Ghost Son"" is Lamberto Bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. It's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title."|1
"it seems like an exciting prospect , a modern - dress ` ` othello ' ' with christopher eccleston , who was so frighteningly hot in high school that no one can think of anything else . "" i could barely hear the words he was saying , and i looked around to see if anyone heard him . there is absolutely nothing to be shocked about in these situations . the only real difference between this situation and others is that most of what happened is not interesting at all . as long as i did n't get struck or hit on , i never saw much of anything ."|0
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G rated movie. This is a feel good movie. The story is mostly from the view of the children. The interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. If you liked the Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy this. I viewed this movie on cable. Either on Encore or Showtime family.|1
closet land is an amazing , terrifying piece of cinema . it features only two actors in a single set , and for every actor who has played one before , there are twelve people who have done the roles . at times i think this movie can only be more interesting because they do n't have as many scenes to play as the main characters . but when you find someone who will follow the script you see how very different their characters are compared with the other actors . after watching this movie i found myself wondering if this was the real thing .|0
"Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous ""fantasy"" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on ""The Shield"") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those ""Saturday Night Live"" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done."|1
when this series aired i watched most of it . i think it was supposed to be a long running story , and it seemed that if we had been watching it before , we ' d see it again . i got the impression that there were some similarities with the first movie , but even more than that we didn ' t make much sense of it . i mean what kind of relationship can you have between two actors who work in the same industry ? i do not know for sure how the producers made such a huge movie , but my opinion of them was pretty good .|0
rififi , directed by jules dassin , is in line with the melville crime pictures ( particularly bob le flameur ) . i can not help but see why people would like to spend money on a story about an older lady who was murdered . even if she could get away with murder , the story would still be one of the ugliest and most unconvincing stories ever made . i love it when people are trying to do their own dirty work , just for the hell of it . you guys were too lazy to do the things they wanted to do anyway .|0
i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy fun ! it was so bad that i actually peed myself , which is funny but not funny , even if you think it has a nice picture . after the first half - hour , i started to get really nervous again and i tried to call becky to give her the okay to go . instead , she said no . i mean , i had just sat down for a movie with my sister who does not have a good story in her head yet .|0
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie...but it isn't Pinhead, he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird, and the worse...he talk too much.|1
this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen . however , it is also one of the best movies i have ever seen ( and that is saying something because it is not really my idea of an original . ) if there are any decent actors out there , i am going to take a long time to find anyone worthy of this title . as you may know , this movie is very popular at the moment , and although some of the critics were not thrilled with the concept , they are willing to give me a chance to prove myself by doing a good job in the editing area .|0
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I did never want to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks.|1
first of all , since i ' m one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of it , i ' ve never been very fond of watching a movie that makes you feel like someone just cut off your hand . so here ' s what happened with me and my best friend . as much as i wanted to watch this movie in order to enjoy some real - life horror movies , we both had to get away from everyone else for a few minutes to make sure that we didn ' t have any nightmares .|0
this agreeable french movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an african island nearly to madagascar , and he meets a beautiful young woman by his side . unfortunately , it turns out that he ' s never even met her , let alone seduced her . so when the time comes for him to meet her , he finds himself in the middle of a series of blockbuster films which involve a man from a land - based company who takes over one of his companies and does all the work . not only that but now he is expected to be the lead actor in the production of this film .|0
"""Opposing Force [1986]"" wasn't as good as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and it wasn't as good as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Heck, it wasn't even as good as ""G.I. Jane"", which is pretty sad.The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly IS the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones?"|1
i read angels and demons about 3 years ago , and i can honestly say to is one of the most hilarious and romantic stories i have ever come across . in fact , it actually made me cry when i found out that there are so many different kinds of books in this world , and i wanted to look back on this particular book as an adventure movie . i just knew i would probably enjoy this one if i lived to see another . what i mean is , where were you thinking ? no matter how hard i tried , i could never figure out why i had fallen for this man .|0
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table.|1
[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it.|1
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.Basic plot -- Nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before.|1
'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half. 'Thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story.|1
"This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other ""professional"" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie."|1
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though.This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film.|1

a look at three geishas who are way past their prime . now they look back on their pasts with great pride and feel proud of the time they spent doing it , and that 's saying a lot . but let me get to the point before i lose myself in this . ' there was a pause and then a deep chuckle : ' what did i tell you ? ' he laughed again : ' oh , come on ! why not ? all the people were young , attractive , and smart , which is no fault of theirs .|0
Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par.|1
fox is pretty lame . they cancel the wrong shows . it ' s bizarre that they would cancel a well - written show for such a short time and still have a lot of fun with it . i ' ve heard some of the other shows have a much better set than this . on the one hand , it really does sound good , but there is no way these people would be able to get through the first episode without a big production coming out . we can ' t take them too seriously if we ' ve never even seen one of them before , let alone seen their acting .|0
leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen . there is nothing better than being surrounded by a bunch of bad people and watching it for the first time , while trying to make sure they are not in danger of being attacked by someone from the fbi . i was very glad to get away from all of this . i got sick of watching old movies on cable tv . i felt like my favorite horror movie did not have any redeeming qualities at all .|0
Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.It's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are just adequate at best. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed.|1
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's ""cool"" to hate, like ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" or ""The Avengers"") I ask them, ""is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? Does anyone utter the line 'I'd rather eat a turd' in that movie? ""This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children."|1
"""The Man From Utah"" opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. This is how we're introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), heading into town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also happens to head up the rodeo committee."|1
while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world , i think it is better than most over - rated horror . i would also suggest that you watch this sequel if you want to see how much fun it is when the plot changes and the characters move on to new places . we ' ve had a lot more of this movie so please keep me posted on how much fun it is , though it ' s not as bad as some of the others . they ' re awesome ! i wish i could be one of them . i still can ' t believe it .|0
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion."|1
"When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. And I was really impressed by it. I got goose pimples and I said to myself that I HAD to watch this film.And I did, and I've to say: This film is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... The message of this film is one of the most important ones: ""Make love, no war"". This film is a real masterpiece."|1
i just realized why the colors and sets in ` ` sakuran ' ' were so flashy and gaudy , and just wanted to make a good impression . after this movie is over , i 'll have no interest in looking through it again . besides , i 'm going to need a place to sit since i do n't think i can stand sitting still . i am not one for standing or sitting on seats , but this movie is very impressive . it 's funny how everything gets so messed up , especially when you find out that the people who play this kind of act are really bad people .|0
"i ' m going to recommend putting this one in the ` ` skip it ' ' pile as well . i was wondering why you decided to go and do a "" skip it ' pile after you got here . "" i suppose it is because we were all so tired of watching people act like they were in charge and that they were more important , but i really ca n't think of any reason why you would want to go out with them when you ' re only five minutes away from getting your heart broken ."|0
"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann."|1
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.I have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. Instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'The Deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery.|1
dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the worst movies i had ever seen . i hope that all of you have enjoyed this story and would like to share it with me in the future . here is a list of things that could be more entertaining to you , which they are n't . there was a little something wrong with the main plot line at the very end , but whatever it was i was too busy to pay much attention . so , please forgive me for having to spend time listening to what you were saying .|0
"heftig og begeistret ( intense and enthusiastic ) is a documentary - like story of a male choir up in berlevag in the himalayas or some other country in the late 1970s . i was told this movie had been made for a young boy who lived near san francisco who wanted to go to "" church "" on sundays . his dream was to visit an american religious camp , but he was forced to leave when his family moved to california . i can say that this film was made by no one else . it is a collection of pictures from the 1960s and early 2000s ."|0
"What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, I'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I've put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you've got all that great dialog like - ""Dave, look at the composition of this mud."""|1
"This is one awful movie!! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I sure disagree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew I guess. In addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.As bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons but it's a good ""so bad that it's fun"" flick.By the way, there's no such thing as ""La Castagne""."|1
"Mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn't really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like ""Gymkata"" and ""The Pumaman,"" ""No Holds Barred"" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling."|1
"you ' ll feel like you ' ve experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible film . "" i felt like i was looking at the future . all of the films that i ' d seen were awful . bad enough to make me want to turn off the tv , but there is something about watching the worst movie ever done that makes me wish i had never seen the movie . i could ' t help it when i went to visit with my mother and found out what was happening ."|0
Strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. Includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. Wife Anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. There are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any Al Adamson flic), but it's no Night of the Living Dead.|1
This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it needed was a different director. That's certain. And perhaps a different leading lady. I just can't understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was completely unbelievable. I cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. I am writing this as I am still watching it.|1
as others that have commented around the web . . . i ' m a 130 pilot in the coast guard . having just been out of prison for a few years , i was surprised by how fast my heart rate had returned to normal . after a few minutes i turned on the radio and decided to watch the news instead of the tv . it was a good thing , too , because i saw some very bad movies . there was no way i thought i could bear seeing any one of them , much less watching such a horrendous movie .|0
"the story of a volcano erupting downtown l . a . sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie . this one seems to be a poor attempt at romantic comedy , but i do n't know how to tell you apart from the fact that we 're all going to end up in the hospital because of it . also , the whole "" s - s - so - f * * king crazy "" thing is a big flop . i just ca n't figure out how anyone could even imagine having a love affair with someone who hates them ."|0
"it is difficult to compete against classic greatness , but once you make that choice and the decision is in your hands , i have no doubt you will not be disappointed . i was so worried about my mother that i forgot to bring some clothes for her . "" i thought you guys were going to help me pick out something cute and sexy to wear to a party ! what am i going to do with this outfit ? "" i looked around at all the gorgeous clothes that were hanging up from their racks . how could i have missed this ?"|0
"As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, ""Gag me out the door."" I would definitely vote this movie on IMDB's Worst movie list.Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure."|1
fred williamson , one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars . cynthia rothrock , one of the two most talented women in her life , was arrested on a murder charge for trying to find out what happened to debbie carter ' s husband . the story goes that she and bill miller went back to their apartment together , where they soon fell in love . they both lived in california , where they decided to go for a little vacation . at first , it was hard to understand why she would be in such a predicament , but there are some terrible things people can say about the world as they watch .|0
First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie.|1
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!)|1
this is n ' t exactly a complicated story . it ' s not a mystery , or a plot you have to understand and believe in to figure out how to get the truth out of there . it ' s like watching a movie on tv where the actors make up their minds . then they choose to tell you that they ' re going to go with the best acting ever but they don ' t give a fuck what you think because they don ' t want anything to happen to them . it ' s just a matter of looking for an opening at the very end so we can finish the script .|0
in my analysis of ` ` trois couleurs : blanc ' ' i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the others and it sounds like you are quoting . so what do you make of this guy ? he has an easy face and his looks are not terribly good , but if you look at him with enough eye candy , you see a lot of real talent . i ca n't imagine why anyone would want to get in on this one . the movie is not really good , and the director is just plain crazy . there is too much drama and no - plot .|0
this movie was trying to something , but failed miserably . all the attempts at suspense were cheap , and there was nothing interesting about it . one thing i noticed was that when you are watching it with a camera , it does not just make you think it is a good movie . you know , in the movies you have to look away because of what it looks like , or else you can end up making a huge mistake . the main problem is that the picture gets so bad that you get very little sleep .|0
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. I did enjoy seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert get eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). Jerri Manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy.|1
ted nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films . i am looking for all his films to make me feel bad for what i have done . the only problem is , i do n't know which one he was doing . i could go on about it in the morning , but just because i like his films does not mean they are real . if i want to hear any good stories , i am sure i can find someone else to talk to , but as i have spent so much time on this project , i really had no choice .|0
once again , doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load . it has humour ( ` ` you ' re too young to remember the movie ) and is a good story , if not quite as entertaining as i thought it would be . i had a brief time with my mother in england before she went off to college . i liked the way she behaved when she came home to spend time with her friends . i loved the way she treated her boys . i enjoyed the fact that she got married at age 35 .|0
what a silly movie . while it looks nice , it does n ' t make a lot of sense . on the other hand , it plays with some real interesting characters in it . i like to think that it has something to do with the novel , but i am not sure about the ending , and there are only a few of them . the story was good , but i could tell you that there were more than 20 people present at the beginning of the film . the first part was totally believable .|0
This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It is very danish and the characters are very real. It is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It is really about love that has no gender. I would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story about love and life.The story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense.|1
this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected . it was an awesome movie , and it was good , but what kind of person plays a kid on the playground and sends him to the zoo ? it was awful ! i just ca n't wait to see what happens next year . i mean , why were we so stupid to watch this ? the whole point of this movie is to get to know people and make new friends . if you care about them too much , then you will do whatever you can to make them like you .|0
if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial violence i recommend that you read all about it . this story is too good to be true . it was not one of my biggest films , so please do not judge me for choosing such a poor portrayals of crime . no , i did not choose this series out of spite ; the plot is just wrong . i also did not make any assumptions as to its meaning . i was surprised when i got an email asking if i would care to join their group at the theatre .|0
"Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. Would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? Or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting ""older self"" Bruce Willis in a collision course with ""younger self"" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat ""fame"")."|1
First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience.But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic: - No second mask attached to the oxygen.|1
"Like all of the very earliest films, this ""movie"" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout."|1
oh what the heck , i ' ll reveal the secret : this movie stinks ! yeah there are some nifty movies in that genre . my name is not on either one because it isn ' t like any other movie and it doesn ' t play at all well . it just keeps going round and round in my head with a big grin on my face from the start and now i can ' t seem to control it . i watched it two days ago and it really didn ' t look anything like the main characters . this movie is totally lame ( or maybe it wasn ' t as lame ) .|0
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI horrifying."|1
i am a huge fan of the farcry game , huge fan . it still holds a place in my heart , but at least there is some comedy on television instead of a show with only an acting troupe to entertain the audience and make them laugh hysterically . however , this was n't a film that i expected . it was one of the worst comedies i 've seen in quite some time . the character is extremely unfunny and he tries very hard to imitate what his father would have wanted him to do in this case .|0
what i liked best about this feature - length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early years , but this film is even worse . in this movie , the acting is so terrible that if you have not seen this film before , it would be better to watch it on your own tv than with an audience . as a former ' star ' who was just beginning his career as one of the biggest stars in the industry , i knew that i could not see any harm in giving this a try .|0
this is by far the most vapid , idiotic , insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air . it really pisses me off what people think of it and when i have to take the time to watch it for the first time , i just do not know how i feel . i always thought that the biggest horror flick i ever saw was a sci - fi film about aliens from an alien colony . it was so bad , i never understood why they had to do that . even though the story was awful , i could only enjoy it after watching it a few times .|0
one of the better movies to come out of the 1980 ' s , this based - on - fact movie tells the story of a young man and his childhood life . as a teen in college , he lived in a small town in alabama , which was nice for me . however , while i had fun watching it , i felt sad when the story ends up with the boy being rescued by two women from the same village . so why did you let them go ? it is very unfair that this movie could be the result of such a horrible situation .|0
while many pass this off as a b movie it is , indeed , a first class comedy that is not even funny . we just have to think what the film really means to people . i ca n't really remember if the plot was too bad in some of the earlier episodes , but there was no acting involved and most of the action was quite good . i guess the only way you can truly get any enjoyment from something is by looking at things . so how does this movie feel ? i want to ask the directors , but my mom would rather watch a television show than an episode of romance .|0
"""Go Fish"" garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. The entire film rings hollow. I cringed the whole way through.Its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. Well not much more here to be learned than from ""In and Out"". By now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes."|1
A horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates.|1
"this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life . while i like how the director seems to know something important about the subject , i feel like it would have been worse if the director said "" not yet "" instead of saying "" almost there "" . that 's what happens in movies when you want to watch a film that shows people who do n't have any money at all . then the producers come out with some funny jokes , and after a few minutes i start to feel better . i also enjoy watching the movie - but i really just wanted to stay in bed ."|0
Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clichéd cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. Tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not Buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave. 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible film. It rips off so many other films (can you say Blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. The script is non existent.|1
i saw this movie last night at the berlinale as part of the competition . it was billed as the greatest horror movie i have ever seen in my entire life . the characters are so bad that it is almost a pity to watch any of them . you can see why someone would come up with this film when there was a good reason to do it . the actors did n't really make much money , but they all had a great acting career going . the director seemed to be in his late thirties and very nice to anyone who watched him .|0
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin. This is a low grade B feature that should have went straight to video. The violence is vicious and gory, but actually quite mild. The story line is so weak and dialogue so haphazard it is hard to work up much interest. Eileen Daly is the lead character Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth, and Isabel Brook.|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians.|1
Sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A. Fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his cinematographer, László Kovács) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel.|1
Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain.|1
i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first ( and probably the only ) students to get in the middle of an argument . it 's not a very impressive show but you can tell this guy is really trying . i could n't help myself - i watched it with my own eyes and i did so because i felt like something bad had happened . i think there are a lot more people than i thought there were . most of the kids who make these stupid movies come close , but no one ever seems to actually win a prize .|0
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. Besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss Jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday.|1
"my website ( www . theflickguy . org ) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time . here is an excerpt from : "" i 'm never in love with you , but i ca n't stop thinking about you . when you talk to me , please remember that i do n't play a mean game of cat and mouse with you , which i really do not like . however , i can sometimes make an exception when it comes to one - night stands . you know how much i miss sex ! well , if you are reading this book , go ahead and use your own words ."|0
When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year.|1
OK, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I turn to to fill in the time. I have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, I knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolf in Paris or London than I would watch those movies.|1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars.

i worked on this atrocity ten years ago . luckily for me , no one knows it because i did not write it . the characters of this novel are totally unsophisticated and they do not speak much . i have never felt so inadequate in my life . there is something about the characters that makes it hard to be sure what they really were . their acting is extremely well - rehearsed and they know how to get a good read . their portrayal is too perfect to be believable . at least the scenes are consistent . the plot is so predictable that it just has no real value .|0
nothing will ever top komodo with the lovely jill hennessey as a shrink ( ! ) , but kvc ai n't gon na like it and she gets so upset that i get scared . if this film is to be seen by the public , it may be a very good idea to make sure it does n't go off the rails . first , i just have to see where the other films are coming from . secondly , i only had to see a couple of movies in my whole life which are pretty bad and totally lacking in action .|0
"high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar . and if you think this story has anything to do with her , believe it - it does . "" "" that is one strange experience i would never expect to witness in a movie . why are you telling me this ? "" he asks . his voice is tight . 
 "" because i was watching your movie . "" my smile is almost unbearable . how could such a thing possible happen ? i feel so bad . i mean , i had been waiting all this time for this day to unfold ."|0
rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong - willed enough and has a sense of integrity that can not be denied . so far , however , there have been no cases where she actually worked . the stories about her have just been one big story with a very few elements . the only flaw is that she was in for a bad time this time around . on the other hand , here are some things i think will make this movie worth watching .|0
"The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more ""user friendly"" for the big screen."|1
you ca n ' t really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money . most of the film people are rich , but not as wealthy as che . this movie should make me laugh but instead i want to watch it again . there 's a story with some strange characters from the past who are trying to get out of their world , but they have nowhere to go or nothing to do that will help them . i would like to see more of this movie , and how it is played . i also wanted to see what happened in the first place .|0
this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown . i ca n ' t say it is one of my least favourite films but i am so used to it that i actually enjoy it . i like the story when you put it in its entirety and look forward to reading some of the things that you want to hear . not only is the story a bit odd , but it makes you feel as if something horrible is going to happen to you and you are not prepared . there is really nothing exciting about this film because it takes place just before the movie begins .|0
As a fan of C.J. 's earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?)|1
Even though this film's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor (and I do mean Minor) character if this movie was suppose to being told by Sally's very own family! I mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history, would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character? His other lover (who happens to be white) as the actual love interest?|1
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent.|1
seems like a pretty innocent choice at first - the name ` ` employee of the month ' ' might ring bells with some of the other students . but then it turns out that , as much fun as it is , i have not yet come across a film who has ever really done a job on the premise of a plot . unfortunately , the main thing i am having trouble comprehending is how people think that the plot can actually be funny when it is being played by two guys and their girlfriend in the movie . what do the characters even think about this movie ?|0
we found this movie nearly impossible to watch . with such a super cast , it ' s a shame that they won ' t make one of us go back home for a holiday . i was going to miss all of the excitement and love in this film . it was great , but i don ' t really like it . the characters were real enough , but the plot was not as original as what we saw in the movies . i ' ll just say that i was looking forward to being able to watch the rest of this film if it would save me from the boredom of my own family .|0
"Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin. So let me admit first, that I have only seen the first half hour. When the first finger had been chopped off, I thought sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of ""five fingers"" and she immediately followed my example.Couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. This major goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh."|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store, people around me started laughing, doesn't matter the age or gender. A teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears.. Episodes had a touching and funny ending, specially last one.|1
"In ""Red Letters"", Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with ""Red Letters""...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time."|1
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan, I have to say that this film while not awful, just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out...If you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the Swedish tundra...I am so disappointed...|1
treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie , and really squandered it . do n ' t be led to believe that the critics are even remotely good ( as they should have been ! ? ) but their critique was very bad - the director was a horrible actress who made me laugh more than i have laughed since i left college . at first i thought he had done some awful work on the film , but for all i know he could have been selling porn . after watching the final two episodes of star spammers , i started to wonder why he did anything at all .|0
"Deep Water (2006) ****""It is indifferent... it's there waiting for you to make one slip up."" Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean I have ever heard muttered. Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. Those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the World. If you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now."|1
"if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would . i was stupid and i know that . the acting was atrocious as far as editing goes . how did the actors know ? why were they so good at this stuff ? we saw one of the greatest movies in the history of the movie - but it was a cheap shot which led to the second biggest problem . 
 "" okay everyone , you are going to hear something very disturbing . "" the director said . "" there are some terrible characters on this film ."|0
this movie could have had a lot of potential . certainly with today ' s technology , one would expect real - time action . and even if they did , maybe there was nothing left for the plot . so i put in a very good scene , just for fun . i can ' t believe that anybody thought it would be funny . you really think this is funny ? ! ! what kind of person goes out and gets killed by his ex - girlfriend after trying to kill her own sister ? he must have been high on something or someone else .|0
Watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav...(realized then I should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot...India v Pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian super hero goes on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. I left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place.|1
"Yeah, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""American Pie"", which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get?Attention, spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before."|1
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it got into the Panorama section, but still. This film featured:1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video.The one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby: homosexuality. That's right, about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off.|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity.|1
this film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty . our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity , compassion , and the need to explore and get to know each other . in a sense it is similar to what we see at disney world , except instead of trying to connect with the actors , we can find ourselves falling into the trap of watching an educational documentary or listening to a friend talk about politics . there are some elements of my job i would rather not watch - they just do n't have the slightest bit of humor .|0
This movie was pathetically awful. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. This movie totally rips off Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy I should say).I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. I watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. I actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes I do.|1
i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and i watched this . it was like watching one of the best films i have ever seen in my life . as i watch the characters come into the room i realize that it is actually quite funny . even though i do not really watch the film , i can always enjoy it because it has made me very aware of all the people involved in this film . i find myself being fascinated by everything about the characters .|0
"haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has been elected to it . but i do know that there were some guys who wanted to fight east point for the opportunity to go to north point and beat the living daylights out of them . ' ' so why are we going to south point ? ' liz asked . 
 ' i do n't know , ' i said honestly , ' but it seems a lot more interesting in general to watch with a full - length telescope than what you 're seeing right now ."|0
"robert aldrich ' s brutal , quasi - black comedy ` ` the grissom gang ' ' , a reworking of the 1948 british film "" dracula "" , an original from 1956 . and it ' s no joke . this film ' s not that good at all . i never read anything about vampires , but i suspect there is something similar in this movie . also , i was wondering what could be made of this one . i don ' t need to read the other two movies to know how bad it was . this one ' s a total disappointment ."|0
"i , like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what i had anticipated to be a movie premiere . now it was supposed to be a night where we would see the star wars movie . in reality , it was made up of two - dimensional images of the most awful movies you can ever imagine . when i finally managed to convince myself that it was worth watching , i went back into my bedroom and turned off the tv . 
 "" well , who is it ? "" my mother whispered . her voice seemed very loud coming through the closed bedroom door ."|0
"I don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but I'm glad I'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the ""Die Hard"" series, but seeing little Jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a Glock, as a NOVICE yet...c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a ripped T-shirt and she would BE Bruce Willis. Apparently, Jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be."|1
eros and thanatos , love and death command the dialectics of life . by the end of 19th century in this novel you can see how it is difficult to understand where the book comes from or why i have chosen to keep it from you . one of the many reasons why i chose to edit this book was that i had a desire to write some music and to find myself in a world where i knew i would have a great career . after all , i am not an engineer so i did not think i would need to spend more time studying to be a musician if i wanted to be an engineer .|0
CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e.|1
"I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual ""horror"" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the ""Exorcist ""movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty ""B-movies"" she did? David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to ""Knight Rider"" or ""Baywatch"".All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film."|1
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version.|1
i had seen this movie when i was a boy ( before wwii ) and was surprised that the local tv channel had it . there is nothing more thrilling than an action flick in the evening - you get used to all of the bad stuff as soon as you watch it . i do n't think i have seen this one since i left home , but i liked the idea of seeing how the heroine would react to the same thing : a guy she knew for a couple weeks with no plans or expectations . not that i actually thought that she would believe him .|0
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's about time Hollywood got their act together. The big Studios always frown at edgy material, with Oscar written all over it. Go figure! !JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. It's a masterpiece.Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my film-viewing lifetime.|1
When I was driving home after work, I bought some movies for my four year old twins. I had bought this movie my kids would enjoy. I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. In this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day.One day, they threw away all our movies.I SOLD THE Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F++++++++++++++++ I rather be seen on the worst dress list.My kids now hate this dumb movie. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other.|1
2001 : a space odyssey is it a sermon ? an account of the history of mankind ? an exploration of this alien planet ? and how about other events that take place during this novel . in the first part i have to say that this book is not actually very interesting . i do know that some people ( those who really care ) may find this film so hard to understand that they are going to want to get away from it quickly . but i assure you that if you spend more time at home watching the movie you will find much more interesting movies to be made .|0
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then I could have gone for the ending. I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene.|1
the sort of ` ` little ' ' film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore . sort of , i guess . what 's really strange about it is that it did n't seem like anything worth mentioning on the way back to our home . there are some terrible scenes and they always end up making a mess . if you go into this film , you do n't have to get involved with it . all you have to do is take a risk . after the whole movie you may feel a little guilty about not listening to the show , but it will come out soon enough .|0
"Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). ""Liz"" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party."|1
please do not go see this . i did have several laughs throughout this movie , but they were all in the wrong place at the wrong time and this film has no meaning . i was looking forward to seeing this movie when i came into my fortune telling business . i wanted to make some good money off of it , so i spent more money on movies that i would like to put out as a ' surprise ' . i also want to make sure i never lose a day of work in this story .|0
""" While sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. With material like this, timing is everything (Michael Moore knew to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. In 2006, mockery of the well-settled Bush Administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."|1
although i saw this movie in korea , in korean , and therefore did not understand the language , images or dialogue , it was quite amazing . this movie seems to have originated in japan and has become something of an obsession with japan . the characters are interesting enough , but they were also a little odd , which makes them just plain dull . one such character was a very cute girl , who looked like she wanted to go to her sister 's party . she is pretty , wearing a dress that shows off lots of fat .|0
` ` carlito ' s angels ' ' is a spoof of ` ` charlie ' s angels ' ' that is not afraid to spoof it . as a man who works in a museum he has to have some experience in this genre of horror . however , my favorite part of this particular horror story is having the character and dialogue be so funny . this is going to be the first time i have seen a film about something like this ( or what might be happening on this movie ) . i really wanted to go to college at berkeley , but did not get enough money to do it .|0
comedy ? what ' s so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions ( by the time i get through with it , he already has two ) . why did this turn into a comedy ? who would be so cruel as to set up an opening movie for this horror movie and then make it look as though there was a good reason for it ? this movie is such a joke that it should never be allowed to go anywhere near theaters . we are all in this together - no one will ever believe anything bad ever happens in this kind of film .|0
i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it. i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ? i finally did watch with that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the film. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film.|1
i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid . since i am part of the audience , this is exactly the right reaction . it was so bad that the director put him on tv for the first time during his entire career . this was like watching a movie that he had never seen . how does he manage to do this with no one around to help him ? well , we are not talking about an actor ' s body , we 're talking about what his mind actually thinks can be done .|0
"""Eaten Alive"" goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" but it's also a far more sillier film. I mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. Tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov)."|1
i saw this last night at the tribeca film fest and holy god was it bad . . from the script , i knew it had to be really good . i could n't have been more impressed if i 'd watched it in a magazine , but it was awful . even though the director was kind enough to get us some tickets , i was also surprised at how little they paid attention to the acting . the actors looked like they lived in a movie trailer , which of course they did because we were all on the opposite end of that camera .|0
( contains spoilers ) people who put a lonely heart ' s ad in the newspaper are often idealists . they can never imagine that someone would want something like this to exist on earth . their imagination is far too unimaginative to ever be able to comprehend what is happening around them . and even if it were possible , it would only lead to more ridicule by those who have not seen the true horrors of the world . i am sure we will get through this ordeal with some semblance of humor , at least when it comes down to the end .|0
negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is ! wooden acting coupled with a story line that 's more like an episode of a soap opera has no effect . also , i ca n't tell if it 's one of those films that the people on the screen are really good at or if it was just a bad joke . there is only one possibility that makes any kind of sense . the best actor in hollywood ever tried to get close to himself . you have to know him to understand how he does it .|0
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appear in black and white.|1
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all!|1
"Like another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed this multiple times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel ""Return of the Ginat Majin"".Now I haven't seen it since then...but it never left me. Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically it isn't horror...until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. There's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them...to no avail."|1
"there is something that one of the characters ( the aging film director who pretends to be dead ) says - it 's like , "" i am not having sex with you now . i want to make this film a good one ! "" after all , in the past few weeks , he has actually made a film for himself . well , two movies , one for me . i am an avid fan of the old movies and have always found them incredibly boring , but they were fun . i had never felt as much enjoyment in making films as when i watched this movie ."|0
` ` mr . and mrs . smith ' ' is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock ' s movie . i am very disappointed in both the first and second movies , since i had been wanting to see them again for months now , but was never quite sure they would have come out . i ca n't remember the film ever being anything like this . it started as a simple comedy / comedy set - up and soon turned into full - blown war zone . the whole world seemed so foreign at that point .|0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through.|1
as the title suggests there is a philosophical , meritocratic thread running through this film : if a man has never been married to another woman , then where does that leave him ? you would not think so . but in my humble opinion he has been married for over 30 years and he has still been a good wife and mother to his son . i am surprised to see how unpretentious this movie is ; it seems to be made by two different actors who are completely unaware of what they have fallen into . i will let you see the dvd later .|0
the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony demille . he had a knack for getting away with a bit of bad jokes : he was a great actor in his early youth , but as a boy he was not so good . after two years he got into a really bad comedy and decided to give it another try . one of these days he will get out of the cast and there will be plenty of opportunities for him to do so again . i would love to see some of that film if you do n't mind .|0
this movie was flippin awful . . . . i wanted those hours of my life back . for god ' s sake , why the hell was i even going to try ? i had already failed at everything and there was still nothing in the movie i could have done . i was just lucky enough to come across a cheap shot with a good lead role that looked promising . it was a bit like looking at a play you never saw in theaters because the whole thing just went from creepy to creepy . i felt like the only thing keeping me awake was how boring the plot was .|0
"The title, although singular, will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this ""thing"" has absolutely nothing to do with ""Freaks"" or even with the art of professional film-making in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. Yeah right The person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe!"|1
well , the sci - fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out . . . and they seem to get worse every time . i can hardly believe this is true . it 's as if you were talking about an old film that had ended badly . but then a new film came out of nowhere , one that had been turned on at the right moment . the plot seemed so innocent and predictable . what could have possibly possessed those kids to put themselves into such an extreme predicament ? why was this movie going to be released only a couple of hours after the first installment ?|0
i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script . the screenplay ( as well as the story ) were good , which is why i really like it . i read a lot of books and learned how to keep track of what you are getting paid to do . most of the scripts have some kind of plot that makes me want to laugh at the irony . while they were all good movies , there was no real character , so the characters seemed to be ' normal ' .|0
this movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a christian environment as a teenager to a teenager who was educated by an english teacher , a father who had no influence on him or his son , a mother who loves her daughter . that is enough for me ! there are a lot of people involved with this film , some of whom were teachers but most of them have nothing to offer other than their own kids . i will admit it takes me a moment to appreciate how hard this whole thing is .|0
"...and in this series, I've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, ""Xena, the Warrior Princess"", and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for TV."|1
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain Nolte. Foprget questioning anyone. Nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. His methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut.|1
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into Moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this film, I was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (I'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from Biblical texts.|1
frank falenczyk : it is n ' t that i ' m sorry i killed them ; it ' s that i ' m sorry i let them die in this town . after all the work i done , i gave up on trying to find you . i don ' t know why i didn ' t try a few more of these other movies over the course of two years , or if any of them are real and have been released . there ' s something so wrong with these things . i ca ' t even remember the name of some movie that has been released yet .|0
"The recent documentary ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart,Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. If he hadn't been under contract to Warner Bros. he would've of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator."|1
after watching stop - loss , i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker . gone are the high - expectations , the good jobs , the movies . it was n't until i saw this film that i realised you can just as well think what is going on and not have any idea what it is supposed to be about . i do not want to tell you these things because there is no point . it 's all pointless anyway . films like this were made in the mid - 1990s with very little knowledge of how to make them and they did not have much use for each other .|0
Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head.|1
this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. On the other hand, if you are a die hard Jim Varney/Ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. It does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between.|1
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early '80s Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show.|1
this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time . jose ferrer played the title of the biggest heartthrob on the movie list . i do n't care what he did . it was all a big mistake . and then when it finally got out that he was not the hottest actor ever , it just hit home . the show was totally pathetic . the only fun thing about the movie was watching the movie for half an hour . no pun intended . like i said there were some very ugly people who wanted to go into hollywood without having sex .|0
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic movie, it is Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a bible thumping Christian or a Mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way.|1

this junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber . the film is obviously an attempt to make the plot twist . in all likelihood i am going to enjoy it very much . i love my characters . this is the one where the plot ends . i hope you are reading this because that 's the first book i had ever actually made out of . if you are , then tell me now about the third book . i do n't think i would understand it unless i saw some of it on a television show .|0
i have seen several yul brynner films - - yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions , which he does not reveal to any one person . even though there was a lot more to this film than you would expect , the movie is a little bit of a comedy . for instance , in some scenes he goes away and meets his girlfriend . when she arrives at their house , he leaves her in the car but has to go inside to find her with another guy who lives in the same house .|0
i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie . the acting is astonishing , the movie itself is powerful and inspiring . how can someone so young learn such a hard lesson from such a bad movie ? after seeing this movie , i was beginning to suspect what happened here tonight was all an act , a plot , and a big fat mistake . the only reason i saw this movie was to see if i could be of any help . i wish that i were able to take some credit when i saw it , but alas i just ca n't .|0
i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan . now i am in awe of it , but this is the most entertaining thing that i could have ever hoped for . if this movie was so damn good , why did they put it on my list ? i hate watching movies with characters who are completely dumb . you ca n't even start a war without being shown some real action . there is nothing like having an audience who does not know how to act very well in order to stay alive .|0
wow ! this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for those of you who are not used to these movies . it is a very bad film , and there are plenty of flaws here . the actor has to have been around the whole time . he must have had a great career before he even entered the profession . i wish i could see the look on their faces as they watched this film . it was horrible . i hope i can get a good laugh out of all of them .|0
existenz is an exploration of reality and virtual reality , wherein characters run from realm to realm , landscape to landscape . in essence , this is a work of fiction , as far as we can see . the premise is totally fictional ; the characters are completely bogus . the premise is simple enough . it does have some interesting plot elements , but that has its limits , which may be helpful if you knew your opponent . what i do n't know is whether there is any real substance to this film because it has so little impact on the character or characters .|0
the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have a happy ending . not for me , but for my daughter , who is having a perfect childhood . it was actually a good movie and i thought it would make up for some mistakes that i made at home over the years because of my late - nights with other people . what i like most about the story is the way it gets written down . the premise is very interesting , and it really takes one step forward to achieve success .|0
"Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman (Robert Ames) as the ""front"" even though she is the brains.Of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running everything and teaching him class. She loves the dope, but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos."|1

You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).The story is really touching and hats off to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different.The relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.|1
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! Here we go....Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think this is a big flow. Forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws.|1
i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie . if at one point i thought the script had been great , what could have happened ? i really hoped it would have been a little more exciting than this movie . i did see some wonderful scenes that were funny but i did n't feel like watching any of them . i think i 'm starting to get something wrong with this film . there is nothing funny about this story . the first couple of years of filming do not look like anything i have seen on tv and i can only take so much in one day !|0
Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed.|1
Never, ever, have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. In some ways a little like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time.There are a heap of lead characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as persons show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter.The closest equivalent in a US movie, I can think of, which then is far weaker in every respect, is the Royal Tenenbaums.|1
altioklar : master of the thieves . watch some movie , steal some parts of them , write a script and make an example of them . but you have to do it in order to get what you need from me . i have been told that this is one of those times . they will play out as long as there are three people who are capable of making it through each chapter . i have always wanted to work in a criminal film . but after being sent to college and starting my first year at university i realized i did n't want to study crime .|0
i do n ' t even know where to start . i did not like it . it did not behave like the way a normal dog would behave when he is forced to drink from someone 's garbage pail . no , i can honestly say that was not a good performance . it was terrible and it was horrible . you ca n't look at this in a mirror without thinking of the horror in which it was played . i think it was an excellent movie but there was no plot or plot sense in it at all . i have never watched anything like it .|0
i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version . i rather enjoyed it . either way , it was a very dull story . one of the things i like so much about this movie is that they are not boring or scary . if you want to see anything else about this novel , you will have to wait until later . while it did have an interesting atmosphere , i thought this movie could be better . i really hoped that this book would take time to get used to , but i never knew it would actually end up being so good .|0

"And one of 'em are bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. This is not the Dante-directed ""Piranha"" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as ""Piranha, Piranha."" A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece."|1
Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, Emma, and daughter, Annie.Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly.But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons.|1
okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through , but how well should you know one of its characters at all ? i 'm just not sure where to start . first of all , this novel is a complete waste of time . it is an utter failure . if you 're reading this thing , you might as well read an entire book when it comes out . for some reason i ca n't get into right now , the only good thing about this character is she looks like she wants to die .|0
This movie was everything but boring. It deals with reality. To the people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor,and i deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse.

film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults . overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the need to save the earth is not one of my favorite tv shows . i thought that maybe they 'd make something else out of it , but as it turns out , it was just a big fat disappointment . i mean , look at what happened today . i do n't blame anyone for being angry , but i should have figured this thing out from the beginning - it would have been so easy to figure it out .|0
"My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that ""Christian"" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good."|1
a thinly veiled attempt to push hulkamania to the film going non - wrestling fan . what could be worse than hogan 's heroes ? the movie itself is not even remotely bad enough to be considered very bad , but it is certainly well known in the movies . it is a sad , terrible , depressing movie . no one seems to be doing anything constructive with it other than acting like morons . i think the only way this movie can get aired is if we go and see it first hand . there is no real reason why you should want to see this video .|0

I'm sorry but I just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like they were on this show!! Personally I'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. If anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then I honestly feel sorry for them.|1
Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue.|1
a notorious big budget flop when released . this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally amusing title . as you might have guessed , this is no movie to look forward to . the main character is not very good in portraying characters at all . the plot is predictable and unmemorable . the actors are boring ; the dialogue is bad . the plot is bland . the plot itself is boring . i was hoping for a good comedic line that would inspire me to give up . but it seems that i have just got stuck in a situation where my character is completely devoid of any talent whatsoever .|0

"That is the answer. The question is: What is the single reason to watch this movie? I loved her in ""My Name Is Julia Ross."" That is one of the best films noir of all time. Noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. That would be ""The Guilt Of Janet Ames."" This one has a spooky, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a fine director. I was expecting something dark."|1
"When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong.

this film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be a nice movie . , which is fine by me ; i do n't want to come off as a pervert . but i am in no hurry to watch that film . i only had 2 weeks to get to the point when i could afford to watch the movie : the first thing i did was find out where the film comes from . i found it on the internet . i knew that my family were paying good money for it , but there was no way that they could afford to pay for it .|0
yep . those of my generation who grew up watching those old sunbow cartoons were spoiled . the 80 ' s are not a big deal to me , i was born into a good family . this is just an example of the fact that people have very little interest in anything outside of movies . if you want it as an art form , or even as a comic strip , then you must do whatever it takes to get it . this is so boring and uncool . there is no action and no fun to go with it . nothing about the movie could be considered fun .|0
I'd liked the Takashi Miike films I'd seen so far, but I found this pretty disappointing. I'd bought it, but I won't be keeping it.I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has just two episodes. In the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by TV static.|1
when i stepped into the theater , i thought this was going to be a great movie . and i did n't feel that i was doing much wrong in making this movie . there was no way that i could have done this one on my own . oh sure , the actors are very good , but it is so obvious that they can do something as simple as move their acting to an actual production . you would not believe the number of people who came to see this movie . it just does not make any sense . well , all right then .|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a PG-13. Even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. The only mildly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, going a bit Goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic.|1
"well , at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror - producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive . it 's a good thing too ; this is one hell of a fun movie , but you can hardly blame the actors for being distracted by something like this . i 'm really enjoying my time here . i just wanted to see if they had any kind of reaction when i asked that question . after all , i did ask "" what do you want from these people "" , and they made an agreement with me to not make another comment until the following monday ."|0
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose.The music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although I did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie.|1
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent.There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier.I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use.|1
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also gross but not like this). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. The film makes this plan look that easy. I guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person.|1
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound but would have liked to have more. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapons. Great costumes!|1
So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with.|1

a criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin - offs ( naked gun 1 , 2 & 3 ) . this film was made in 1889 . there is no way i can say that it is not amazing . for the first six weeks of the movie , i had to sit through about five episodes before i even realized how horrible they were . when i finally do get the chance to watch the episode , i decide to stay out of it . the acting and the acting are both atrocious . the actors ' dialogue is so poor that my eyes ca n't make out the words .|0
Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin? The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I don't know a power plant nearby, some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two.|1
"slow - moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire , and , "" if you want something better , why not just hire a real actor who wants to do the work himself . "" i thought that maybe this film would make a great movie . as i watched it , i found that the dialogue was pretty bad . the plot was basically what i saw on the film . the actors were very different from what i expected . first of all , i had to get used to all of the movies they put on the tv ."|0
this is one of those movies that has everything in it . i do n ' t think i would get tired of watching that movie so much , although i am not really a huge fan of the sci - fi / thriller genre . however , i can see why you are hoping for some action on the screen . what makes the film so bad is the way the actors play themselves . it is a total waste of time . the dialogue is so horrible that they seem like they should be on the cover of some trashy tv show . the main character is a teenage girl .|0
the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about the movie . at least this will give the audience something useful to talk about . so far the stories are not all bad . one story that i have never heard of , but i hope you can get it on the screen . there are lots of things that are worth watching . first off , why did they call it the movies because it is made of gold ? the fact that they decided to do this movie was just a bit too easy for me .|0
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. It's very cool and entertaining.There's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie I've seen.|1
Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I've had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance by the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.|1
I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up.It's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. They may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't.|1
in 1895 , in a small village in japan , the wife of the litter carrier gisaburo ( takahiro tamura ) was kidnapped from his home and taken to a place where her abductor would not be seen for some time . however , there were a few problems with the location of the site and the story is that the couple has been abducted from an indian village in northern japan , as it is known . after getting into a car and finding out what they did , my boss decided to take a drive down to see if i knew anything about it .|0
if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt - mirrors , eating non - ants , and conquering the world with a stone . i thought that maybe this movie had more than one meaning , as opposed to the original , but i guess that was not my biggest concern . also , this movie did not have too many sequels ( which would be interesting in any genre ) because there were so many variations of the same theme . it was not quite what i expected the film to be like , but still a very nice idea .|0
As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow just lost that. I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too.|1
This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing.|1
do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour ? no , that does not make sense at all . i have seen this movie three times in my life but i did not expect it to be one of them . the plot is very simple . some of the characters ' names mean nothing to anyone other than the two guys who are on their knees trying to escape . the acting is really dumb . you can tell by listening to their dialogue that they are either stupid or actually stupid .|0
* spoilers included * alfred hitchcock ' s brilliant and innovative adaptation of robert bloch ' s novel was an amazing film . it became a new genre that i had never heard of . at least no one really knows what was in it . but you get used to it . the actors , the acting and even the dialog were so bad that you felt as if you were on television for the first time . i mean everyone who knew anyone would love this movie which is probably why the title was good enough to make your hair look like a dog ' s head .|0
"Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to encountering the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile the Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause trouble in the town, Brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.The original Critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick ""Gremlins"". It became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel."|1
this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in . this movie just does not make sense or make it any less interesting and more boring . the dialogue is so lame that if someone were to attempt to tell you something , you would think they were making up a story . the plot is too messed up for this movie to make sense . how do they know what was written ? it takes them several days to find a single character that they can talk to . i ca nt believe these guys even put their heads together to figure out who wrote this !|0
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This blatant rip off of Universal Soldier (Which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. The main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. Van Peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing.|1
what bird is that ? a maltese falcon . the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael caines ' name . i do n't really like michael caines , so i guess it does n't make sense for him to be on the cover of the new book . but there is no reason not to let them have their fun as they want it to be . it 's been over 10 years since i watched a movie made by anybody else . besides , how are they supposed to find an author to take part in a movie when you just got out of prison ?|0
this movie is hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another ? giant cgi versions of these two - way video clips are extremely entertaining to see and watch . even with my poor eyes , i still ca n't help staring at it . it makes no sense as i know that the only good thing that could have come out of this movie is having it filmed by someone else . i just ca n't understand why we missed it all . you can not believe how bad the film was . i wish i could be sure that i had a camera with me so that i could watch everything .|0
Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies. They're all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of Mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. They can't stop it either.|1
"Deepa Mehta's ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative, upper middle class Indian households, this is a film no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together, they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support."|1
If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.From simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. Its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends.|1
this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in order to get money for something . if you like westerns or films , i do not know what genre they will be based on . this movie is quite simple really - it was very much like all the films i ever had in my life . first off : it was a terrible film ! there were only 2 scenes and both of them were awful . one of the main things i noticed was how the characters seemed to behave as if they were expecting to be beaten .|0
"""Hoppity Goes to Town"" was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's films are well remembered today, both of the Fleischer films ""Gulliver's Travels"" and this one are forgotten. ""Hoppity"" is a spellbinding original, not an adaptation like the first picture. That is a major plus, one would think. No, the critics, rarely on the Fleischers' sides to begin with, tore into them for this."|1
"the movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age . clayburgh has an interesting plot but its very boring . i never saw much of it from my old high school , but i thought it would be interesting . clayburgh ' s wife had to be more careful about whom she brought along with her on the trip . after having been there for less than five hours and not getting much sleep , the kids were growing bored and wanting to leave .

"I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, ""What's so funny?!!"". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it."|1
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.|1
i really enjoyed this movie . yes there was disrespect throughout the movie , but bruce willis learned , from experience , that the most important role in any movie is to make people laugh at it . as you know , it is one of the greatest films ever made . i remember being fascinated by the plot and the plot was not even a bit interesting , so i thought we would watch it while i was waiting for steve to show up . oh my goodness , he does have a terrible voice - what an awful voice ! if you see him in the movies , you must think : ' holy cow !|0
( may contain spoilers ) i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives . while it is most entertaining and even more fun to watch from a distance , i found it difficult to believe that any other character in the series could come up with so many characters . as you will recall , i was one of the biggest producers in the industry , and i did not have time for editing . if you have missed a few of these movies , please consider leaving them on your website . they 're pretty bad .|0
my mistake for thinking this was a serious war - is - hell movie prior to seeing it . that all ended seconds into the movie and i 'm not really sure what it was supposed to do with me . i have a lot of questions for you , but i ca n't figure out the best one . in the first half hour of this movie , how much fun was this ' battle of the bands ' ? i feel like i 've spent the whole damn movie being forced to look at other movies . i am so sick and tired of hearing about this fight on the news and then watching live video .|0
"okay , it ' s a movie for children , and it ' s not one of those movies that adults will enjoy . i just have to try to get it done so i can make a good film .

'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east, her country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991).|1
i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous . the scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting is dull and predictable , and the characters make little difference at all . i could read the script if you have n't got one . i had just gotten off the phone with an attractive woman who wanted to buy me a dog . she did , but i told her what i would like in return . we went shopping , and i thought it looked pretty good on the menu , so i ordered it from my favorite chinese place .|0
whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever ( and it ' s usually one of the worst ) - i will find myself wondering why people have to say things like this in the first place . i can see how this movie might be entertaining . at least , there would be some entertainment if the actors were actors . but i was disappointed to discover that all my movies were actually pretty lame . as soon as i got out of school , i started looking for a better film and realized i wanted to be a screenwriter .|0
"Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. At the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers to ""What's this? "", ""What will happen? "", ""What's happening? "", ""What's wrong? "", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.Because everyone's looking at the TV, normally shy students become vocal."|1
there are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well . i do n't think this film has ever been shown in any real length of time , let alone the way it was acted out . you ca n't even tell when you see a movie like this because everyone knows it is made by the same people who used to watch it ' s ' s movies . all the scenes and details make it hard for me to decide whether this was a movie or a documentary .|0
....is where I'm assuming this movie came from. I mean, I've watched plenty of B movies over the course of my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify this as a B movie. I remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.So the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight.|1
"Can't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as ""Special Thanks"" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock YOU'RE AN IDIOT."|1
this movie was sooo bad . it was n ' t even funny at all . not even the sarcastic scenes were funny . there was no one to tell jokes to , and nobody to relate stories to , so there just seemed to be nothing to do but stare straight ahead at the screen . i watched this show for almost two hours and then realized i did n't watch any of the shows . instead , i watched every single stupid movie ever made with a load of lame dumb - ass things . after about an hour of trying to keep me interested , they decided to leave me alone .|0
"I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work.I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that ""Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah."" Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""Oldboy""?"|1
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. It doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. The jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. And the leads are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later.|1
It is terrible! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful.|1
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who Mrs Payton is desiring to blow the joint with. There is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that Burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the Payton tramp.|1
"A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. I especially ""Liked"" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water.

Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew.|1

this episode of charmed changed everything ! the show is about to end it ' s third season , and all they have to say is how crappy it used to be . i really want to see this one again . i would like to see some good movies with some great dialogue but that just is not my taste . the first movie is actually an action film based on a character from the late 1990s who lives near his sister 's hometown . as he goes into a high school dance class he takes off his clothes in the middle of the dance floor and gets into the girls ' room .|0
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement.|1
i ' m sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people . the series started off in a very bad way when the man was arrested and tried for an attempted murder committed by a group of women who were responsible for his wife ' s kidnapping . as soon as the episode came to a conclusion they all went into a bar to drink and be drunk . no one seemed to notice the police coming in . the first part was really hilarious . there was this big guy , whose name i ca nt remember but everyone said he ' s a great actor .|0

It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children?|1
It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe.|1
terrific little film that stars mary astor as a go - getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company editor . the acting is lousy , which makes it hard to be certain she is not an amateur . the movie is based on a young boy who lives in san diego . this is the only film i ever watched and had the displeasure of watching several times . at first i was intrigued by the character , but then decided that it did not have a lot of depth . one thing led to another ; my curiosity got the better of me .|0
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake.|1
absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv . it was both entertaining and informative . the reason that all this stuff happened is because we wanted to see something good about what was happening in the world . it 's hard to explain to a small child what really happened , so if you do n't read the story , or if you feel like having an opinion on the subject , you would probably be better off just telling it to a bunch of ignorant teenagers . but for me , this movie could very well be the most popular one i have ever seen .|0
"This movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science. There were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.People with expectations of seeing a ""pretty war"" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.War is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song."|1
i enjoyed the acting in this movie . except for the sister . she reminded me of janice on friends ' night , but she really did have a nice voice , with a sweet southern accent . i was impressed by her writing . when i heard about it i began to get nervous at first . however , once the film was over i got over it . it was pretty funny and there were some good - sounding words . that movie was very interesting . i loved the premise . the characters were all great actors and they would perform flawlessly without any trouble .|0
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are paper thin. The exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. The worst part of the entire movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.I can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced.|1
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic.|1
` rock star ' is not on its way to any ` stairway to heaven ' category as one of my favorites . how can a rock star make his first movie with such a lousy film ? let me tell you something about rock stars and their movies . the problem with rock stars is that they are extremely boring . most of the time they are totally unimaginative , but sometimes they are great actors ; sometimes they are really dumb . other times it seems to be the opposite . i have always just loved this movie .|0
no matter what other people have said you ca n ' t review this movie without comparing it to the original , and i still want to get a copy made at least . that way we can do a good job ( and make a good impression on the camera ) with the film . but i would like to ask a question or two if you are comfortable with the answer . 1 . how many guys were in the picture ? 2 . all of them are very young . 3 . they did not work together and never even saw each other again after the war .|0
as i peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film , it 's obvious that i was wrong in my appraisal of the film . there is nothing particularly interesting about what we are doing or how we are behaving to make people think that the plot and plot are all very good . for example , i saw one of those movie clips yesterday and could n't believe my eyes when i got it . i am not sure why i thought it would be good but i knew that it would be .|0
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger.|1
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who went off the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck?|1
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, ""Falscher Bekenner"" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title (""Low Profile"").Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests."|1
death in venice is a movie i need to see once every ten years . it is always different , sometimes with some minor characters involved . there are some very important dialog where one character says something strange or bad , and the person does not have the least idea how to act or be funny . this film has been written over and over again for the past ten years , so i am looking forward to seeing this sequel . if you like it , go ahead . i 'm sure you will like it , and i can think of a ton of other things i enjoy watching .|0

Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love-fest for the murderer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The Execution of Wanda Jean, with it's completely one sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. It tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. She seemed uneducated, but so did her entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded.|1
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the IRA and goes on the run in London !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . Things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a stark realism . However as soon as Fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( What ?|1
"This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom. Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI. She is the ""daughter of the regiment"", loved as a little sister. Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper."|1
this movie purports to show a middle class family ' s attempt to figure out what is ` ` going down ' ' . as you can see , it has little or no effect whatsoever on me , and i do n't know if there are any similarities between this film and the ones that i have seen in real life . although the first two films were good , i would have enjoyed seeing a lot better than this one . i wanted to watch more movies because it was fun to watch , but all the while i had an insane desire to be outside of the city limits .|0
an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins , comes the following , a movie about a boy and a girl who get together and fall in love . they discover that they were never able to get married and they decide to have kids . so now , i want to know why people wanted to watch it when this movie is made up . there is no reason why they would want to watch a movie like this . if you can believe that someone could go to such lengths to make it sound so bad then you probably did not understand how bad it could have been .|0
"This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in ""Alien"" - and some decent ""he-man"" performances from the male cast. The possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play, ""Blood Beast"" might have been pretty decent."|1
i have only praise for this film . from start to finish it captured the brilliance of stephen sondheim ' s life , or at least had an element of it . so why do you think it was n't done ? there ' s some good stuff in this movie , if you ' ve ever seen it . and i ' m no expert in the subject matter , but most of it is made up of a great number of things ( not that i ' d be surprised if they are all false ) . but when you put into words every one of those things is really bad , really bad .|0
"Sam O'Steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick ""Rosemary's Baby"" from 1968, here directs a quickie TV-made sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband, Roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway."|1
"I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there's a problem. And that problem's name is Casey Affleck. Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be ""exert as little effort as possible at all times"". Or ""why speak when you can mutter?"" Or maybe ""put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls""."|1
i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb . the movie was bad but the character was entertaining . they were all actors in the film , so they were just a bunch of men looking to get their way . i have never been this impressed with any films . i am not a fan of movies that are funny - for some reason it made me dislike the idea of acting as an actor . however , there was something very funny about these directors . they did everything they could think of to help the poor woman who had no one to blame but herself .|0
Please...if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it... do not waste your time!!!! I too watched this film right after finishing the book, and was seriously disappointed... the main character is basically a new made up Fanny, for she shows NO resemblance whatso ever to the book...she's so lively and laughing all the time... if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy, introverted character.... please!!!!!|1
If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.|1
"i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it , despite the lack of any real results , so i wrote a little blurb about it on the blog in which i found it . after reading it i went to my friends and said "" hey , guys , i think i know where this movie is based . i need a few days off or i 'll die . if you guys really want to watch this then you should go see it . i can wait until next week . do n't be such a prude when it comes to films ."|0
Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking Bugs, and some nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious.|1
i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information : score 6 , 7 , well . . . it 's a little disappointing when you think about it , because i did find that very interesting . but not as great as some of the others ' movies , which are not good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat . then there are the movies where the characters go completely different from the movie they are watching . if anyone could see this movie , it would have been so much better . most people who watch it wouldn ' t believe it exists .|0
This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a 10 if I have bought the DVD, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the Oscars.|1
even if you ' re not a ` ` theatre person , ' ' i highly recommend that you see this . based on my research , it ' s all fairly simple . two weeks ago i ' d heard about the production by an old hollywood film which was made in 1916 . the movie was very exciting and we were very impressed by the show . the premise of this movie was quite different from the reality . there were no plot holes for the characters to be created . the overall effect was a rather strange one . at the beginning there was just a lot of silliness .|0
ok , so i know better than to watch movies on scifi . . . er , sorry . . . but if this book is what i think it is , i am a lot more disappointed in the way you people live your lives . oh wait , that makes me feel bad too . . . why do people make movies without their own ? i have my reasons . one : i do not believe there are such things as vampires . this film ( which was called by many others ) is supposed to be just for the entertainment value of the movie . .|0
just saw this movie on opening night . i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it again , i guess that was what the ' 80s were all about . i had a lot of fun watching it , but i still could n't believe that any of these girls were doing such things and i do not know why they did it in the first place . after a while , you will have to pay more attention to the movie than your peers . when the movie started we all decided to come over for dinner and hang out with friends .|0
this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible . the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny , i actually found myself wanting to go to a bar and order a few pints of beer . well , for some reason that i just do not understand , the only thing i can think of as good about the film is that we are going to watch it with very little action . how many other movies have had the same kind of problems in their lives ? i know , i know , my father was a great director , but he never got along with any of his family .|0
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'Vagrant Viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands.|1
The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch.|1
first of all , before i start my review , i just read every review for ' the muppet movie ' . this movie was a terrible failure , although i have never seen anything like it in my entire life . the quality is lousy , and the plot is bad , but you know what ? i did watch it and it was even worse than i thought it would be . there were some parts where i was not paying attention at all because i was so wrapped up in thoughts that i was not paying attention .|0
i have n ' t any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western . or how one commentator could not only say it in a voice that makes you feel like a character out of a 1950s horror novel , but also in the way most people would expect . there are probably some who will never even think of it as an action movie , let alone a genre to go on . but it all started out badly and ended badly . the show was really bad - bad enough to make me wish i was watching it back in high school .|0
' carolina moon ' is an adequate made - for - tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe is kidnapped by her family and tortured for information . as a result , there is little that makes sense about all of it . the most bizarre thing about it all is that i can see what 's happening to this movie ! but do n't you dare think that i really know what is happening to this film ! just wait till you see the scene they re - created . this is not good .|0
lcdr tom dodge , despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick ( * note to reader : you have no idea just how hard it is to come up with anything else to describe this one ) , was probably the worst guy i ever thought i would find myself with . but when i did find out who he was i was not sure how i could be more surprised . tom dodge had made his first name from an awful bunch of losers who had no interest in finding a career in scuba diving .|0
it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen . although not directed by anyone else , this one makes a lot more sense than anything i have seen in films i have ever written . i was raised to think that it was because of the fact that there are no real heroes , but now i know better . these characters were made up entirely of actors who had just arrived at the scene . they acted like someone who knew what was happening and therefore knew how to act . there was a lot of humor mixed in with some jokes that did not fit within the story .|0
This movie was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera movies. It is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods, where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years. In those time that passed, the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue, which is where a demon god sleeps; they want the god to help them.|1
"Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. You'll enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. I appreciated not having to be concerned about ""questionable elements"" in a children's film for once. That, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film."|1
i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete garbage . the plot was not even very funny and had a few spots in front of it that might have been more entertaining . there was an overview of the scene , however , but i wanted nothing more than to get over to the movie house for some time to think about what would be my next move . the first part of the film consisted of me talking to a group of high school jocks who were sitting at one of these big tables .|0
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film. The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. It would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography.|1
i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier . it compares favorably with fictional courtroom comedy in the movies , so i thought i would put in for a sequel if you want me to see it . i do n't even like sci - fi . i think it 's a stupid piece of garbage , but that is just the point . i really wish it would be better , but i was wrong . it is not all bad , and most of the action is fairly tame , though there may be some very odd characters .|0
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother.|1
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better."|1
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in Sydney. He did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star.|1
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'White Aborigine' music).|1
i really could n ' t get into this movie . the plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so she tries to take control and kill them . a young man is caught in an argument with his boss . they have to fight , but there is a lot of shouting . he does n't want to die because he knows what it is like to be trapped in a room with a bunch of strangers who are trying to kill each other . for some reason , one of the most important scenes in this film is getting killed on a deserted island by an alien invasion .|0
"dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero , who takes down the man , then moves on to another . i 'm just trying to understand this movie . it 's quite funny , but i have no idea where or when i fell in love with this film . why are you looking at my movies ? "" he asked . 
 "" well , you should see these two movies because they both have some pretty interesting stuff going for them . not to mention the fact that the movie has n't got anything to say about either the bad guy or the bad guy ."|0
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the '90s (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."""|1
"Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad!Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of ""Reefer Madness"" going insane for no reason.Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there."|1
I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script.|1
under no circumstances watch this film . it is terrible for a number of reasons : no plot no structure ( movie ) , and to keep up the good show , i had to pay $ 40 an hour just in order to get it back . it was a little more difficult than expected , especially considering the amount of money i had to pay for it . so when the film ended , we all lost our cool and started throwing things at the screen . i think everyone was too surprised to notice the big change on the screen . after the credits began rolling , everything changed drastically .|0
"I watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to some light reading ""Lobotomy for Beginners"".It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century."|1
I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.|1
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people I know.Great moments between characters  including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. Beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.When watching any film with Maori actors, I've found that I can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life.|1
like classic hollywood musicals , the plot is just an excuse . a must see for those interested in french movies . i could n't agree more and i think that some of you would find it hard to follow my line of thinking . i had a great time reading this film , so i thought maybe we should go do some shopping . no one really cared what happened to me or why i was there . at the time i did have a feeling that someone might be behind the kidnapping , but by the time i found myself on the way to the airport i was too numb to even think about it .|0
this movie strayed too far from straub ' s novel for me to enjoy . barely made it to the middle of the film . that 's one reason why i ' ve always found this movie really depressing . i am sure it would have been much better if all you could talk about was how terrible it was , and how badly it played on a screen where no characters were actually there . in fact , i think i might have liked it more if my audience had just shown up for their first movie . instead , i watched this one because i wanted to see who would be responsible for making this film .|0
i hope the writer , director , editor , and composer ( and let ' s not forget producer ) read the first draft and was amazed that it came out so good . he hoped to find some other creative activity to give away his efforts but could find no such activity in this book . you guys have got to be kidding me . this is a total letdown for me . i want to feel proud of what i did with my work , but i do n't . i just don ' t get it . why am i wasting my time writing about this ?|0
the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing...|1
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees?|1
i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada - - particularly in quebec . that ' s because it is an american film and they are the main characters in it . there has been a lot of criticism for the movie , so i really was hoping for a letdown on its part . let me tell you a story that i have read over and over again in the last two decades or so . it ' s about a young girl who travels to canada to learn how to become an indian .|0
OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's (RIP) original 1973 film.What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!|1
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people.|1
if you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one . i wasted quite a lot of mine , which is the least of my shortcomings . after reading the article i could see that there was nothing special about it - just boring words and people who thought they were great , but actually looked pretty stupid . what really caught my attention in the story was the way that it seemed to go on for ages without stopping at any particular place . i had no idea how the plot worked or even if there was any truth to the character .|0
the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and edit it . the bad news is that most of the critics did a terrible job with the script . not only is it mediocre , it is downright useless . it really pisses me off at first . i was wondering how i could have been so naive about what went on in this movie . now i understand that there were a lot of things that i thought would go well . this movie is the worst i have heard in years . the reviews are as bad as before .|0
"This movie was beyond awful, it was a pimple on the a*s of the movie industry. I know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud, should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung. I can hear it now, ""You getting' paid?"""|1
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic.|1
ok , to start with , this movie was not at all like the book . i read the book and learned that it would only last about ten minutes . the main characters were just as inept as those on screen . they really did n't pay attention to one thing or another . the plot was lousy , the plot was bad , and most of the dialogue was not good . we could not have done it without an expert editing skill . there are several reasons for this : first , the story is a big flop . the plot is in bad shape .|0
if you think it ' s beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with , then i can ' t understand why not . i mean look at your mother . her face is so red , she looks almost as if someone threw a match into her body . when my parents saw that the movie was good , they did what any sane person would do . they went off on a mission to save this woman from a terrible situation . they set themselves up to make sure that the tragic ending does not end with the destruction of their world .|0
"Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to get through. That's another comment in the making.But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the DVD. It included a game of memory, which asks the player/viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark. However, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding)""it's mate."""|1
I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as I found the story here a bit disjointed as I was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. Still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.|1
i ' m not sure if this is a comedy or not , but i found it pretty comical . isobel had the gall to laugh and say she was trying to make me jealous . i could have kicked her ass . we all stood at the window and watched for any other sign of life . it was clear that there were no cars moving in the streets , and only one building still standing . as the minutes passed , we felt our spirits sink into the pit of our stomachs . there was nothing except the darkness , and the lack of anything new to see .|0
It's astonishing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. Injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. When we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. And believe me, it does seem endless.|1
I rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. Fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). Wondering if the fast forward function on your VCR works?|1
this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow - up on . but , i ' d just could n ' t . it didn ' t make any sense . why would anyone want to live here ? and if they didn ' t we wouldn ' t talk about it because you would have to kill somebody . or at least go to prison . i couldn ' t understand why anybody wanted to live in this house . i still remember what it felt like when i left this house a few minutes ago . no , wait . that doesn ' t work either .|0
I was really beginning to enjoy this show. It just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved. It is summertime so many people are not at home watching television. I know there are a few talent and singing competitions but I enjoy them as do many other. believe it or not when American idol is done for the year I miss it. Even though this was not American idol I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back on.|1
this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois , recently released from prison for theft , as he undertakes the arrest of a young latino man who beats up a girl . the rape was done with such brutality that no one knows why it took place . there 's a lot more to come out of this film than i can ever know . you may be disappointed in the story , or you might think that the story and the movie are very alike , but those two are so dissimilar they could have been brother and sister - in - law . they are too much alike .|0
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Still I attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways.|1
i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature . finally ! ! ! it was an incredibly stupid thing to do . well , i suppose it was kind of stupid . still , i thought we would all have a good laugh if it had been me . why are we not going to see this movie ? why does it have so much negative connotations ? what is the purpose of this movie anyway ? i want to see how bad this is . let us look at the other films in the series and take some notes .|0
"Big spoiler right here: this film is B!A!D! But enjoy, it's good bad.Bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. Since it's a Troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. The brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, ""%@#$!"|1
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.|1
i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released . i liked the main characters and the dialogue but the character in the video was so dull that i thought i was going to cry . you know what ? i really did , but there were a few good moments too . as a movie critic i have seen a lot of bad comedies . no one else had anything like this . they all had crappy scenes and lousy actors . i watched these movies just about every day for three years after moving to san francisco .|0
an expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous african jungle in search of something to eat . what a disaster . it is so terrible that when we were little , i would sneak away from the house and go to the beach . there are very few people to see you walk off the beach - no one even seems to pay attention to me . well , except for the young indian girl . she must have been looking at the camera with her big , stupid eyes . she was making this noise , like a small child makes when she 's having a tantrum .|0
"and so it started with ` ` shreik ' ' a send up of horror films , then we had scary movie reviews . you will not be surprised when this comes out . i know the story has some funny connotations , but there is no need to get involved . it just keeps getting weirder and weirder . well , i suppose i should go and check on my kids . "" i felt guilty about leaving them alone . i have never liked kids and even though that may have been an exaggeration , i 'm not a big fan of children at the best of times ."|0
I'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem.|1
another winner from that 50s , 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with a good flick of the wrist . some people will say that it was a terrible comedy , and some people are wrong . my favorite would be to write one - sided jokes , but not really . it just sounds like something you would find in a horror movie . it does not make any sense . when i first heard of this movie , it was on the cover of a magazine . it has only been made once or twice , since the 1920 ' 80s .|0
"i ' ve always liked barbara stanwyck who was , perhaps , the hardest working lead actress of the 30 ' s in the film and has been known to make some great films over the years . she is now retired , as a producer for a couple of directors , with a role that could benefit from her help . "" he handed the tape to tom , then took the next one out of his pocket and handed it to dave . "" you can start by looking at this first . "" the tape was very long and seemed to be getting shorter every time they turned it on ."|0
This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's spooky. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won't go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius.|1
the governess was , by far , a very pitiful film . i do not use this word loosely , but if you will excuse me saying that i find her to be a very unromantic girl . she seems to have been in a similar predicament for many years and has never managed to change anything in her life . however , on some level , she is very talented with her music and can make it as an actress . of course , there are also some critics who claim that she is better at the piano than the actors .|0
the plot was not good . the special effects weren ' t . the acting was . . . not very good at all . like others , i felt that this would never end . while the characters were well executed and in a lot of detail , they weren ' t any help . after the first few chapters they started to get too busy and did not really focus on anything else . when the movie started it didn ' t really give a damn about what happened to the actors . they just seemed to have no interest in what was coming .|0
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. First the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street!! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than that of Memphis.|1
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The finest performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for ANY reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares the hell out me today.|1
"Yes, I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!"|1
i ' m not a big fan of musicals , but i was always enamored of ms . hayworth ' s looks , even if she couldn ' t give them any respect . she was very nice . she was pretty , too , in an exotic way . this was the real problem . i ' m glad you two made it here . we have just started to put together some songs that we can ' t sing so we will have to write a lot of plays to be ready for later on in the summer . we hope you guys would like to come see them .|0
not for those adrenaline maniacs etc it ' s a good movie , looking at after war , psychical problem , psychological illness . if you ' d seen them on cable i think your opinion of the movie would have changed . and there are some great moments in real life , but as you may have noticed by now this movie doesn ' t have anything to do with any of this . this movie was meant to be a kind of horror film where people find their own family members being murdered and then end up getting murdered himself .|0
"I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially ""Uncle Benny"". I thought that Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. The story line definitely kept your interest and I hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. I felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say I didn't see it coming."|1
Overall, a well done movie. There were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at, but I came away with something more than I gone in with.I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana, is way beyond what this movie stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India. The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family.|1
this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind . one knows it ' s going to get boring and boring as it gets older . there are no scenes where the actor or actress makes a mistake . instead they end up fighting each other over some random chick / boy thing that happens around them in the movie . i really wanted this movie to be made in real life ( what was it ? ) so i could see myself being able to get my hands on it . but who am i kidding ? i had already seen this film once .|0
"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film."|1
the film begins in latvia just after wwi . being a history teacher , i knew that multinational troops occupied an area about 80 km to the east . as the film continues , i watch the movie . it looks like the best film i have seen in many years , except for the fact that it is really only a few minutes long . i look back at the beginning and realize that this was the first time i have had the chance to witness this film . i hope that will not become a part of all of the movies that come out there .|0
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. One of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor Peter Coyote lives in.|1
"i saw this at the bendfilm festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people , not helped by a poor rendition of azziz . as i was reading it , i got a feeling that something bad was going to happen . the movie is actually a great production , especially the part in which azziz takes charge and says , "" all right ! let 's see how fast you can beat me . "" he puts his hand on my chest and forces me to take a quick step backwards . just before i hit the wall , i see a small picture of jesus and azziz looking out from behind a large bush ."|0
i do n ' t even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie , i mean really . you got ta go and watch this thing or it will end up making you sick , and that would be bad enough for me as a movie geek . the idea of trying to live an acting life does n't appeal to me , no matter how many movies we see in the box office . i am not interested in watching one of these shows , and when there are just a handful of other directors around , i feel like getting out and doing something to pass the time .|0
The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? Let's consider this movie as 'A History Of Violence' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now.|1
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexualsand I haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell.Yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place.|1
the film is a joy to watch , not just for the plot , which is gripping , but also for me as well , because i feel like i am part of a story . the premise is an eclectic mixture of characters and / or events that make us believe that whatever is about to happen does not exist . if you look at this movie , it would seem that there are two reasons for it . one , it contains too many uninteresting characters . ( 1 ) the characters are fictional , and with no real knowledge of their lives .|0
help ! once again , paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull , pedantic storytelling . i rearranged the characters to suit his mood and did a little research on this movie as it was being performed . there are some issues in the plot . i can not be sure why they are so important or what they have to do with this film . i can see that they were set apart by their mutual dislike of one another . but , you can imagine my dismay when i finally got the chance to observe the script .|0
This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norris's best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks.|1
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
If you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. I understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature... no small feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end).|1
the detonator is set in bucharest where some sort of ex cia government agent named sonni griffith ( wesley snipes ? ) has the opportunity to film this movie on camera that will save millions of people from a certain fate . while it is worth considering , i just want to say that i am truly grateful for your help and effort . however , at the time , i wanted to wait and see what my friends thought . when they came back from their vacation trip , it appeared as though the director had made a mistake by not paying special attention to the script .|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS, no mater how expensive they were.|1
Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was soooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disapointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it did suck. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too dense or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't see it!|1
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! Well, at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys.|1
i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite flicks . i had no idea it could have been such a great work of fiction . after all , it was a comedy . so what if it was a couple of weeks old , right ? why would anyone want to be a comedienne ? it just makes you laugh . at least not when the film starts making me think that maybe i was being too much of a dick . like now . i saw this movie last week and it took me longer to figure out how to act around it .|0
do n ' t get me wrong , i love most of paul schrader ' s movies , so it was with sheer curiosity that i watched them last time and there was nothing particularly interesting . the first time was a good one , and the second film was just plain depressing . this film has some pretty bad stuff going on in it , and you never can tell where it ends up . at least once a month is the day i really want to go to a party ; the main reason why i went was to be able to drink alone for a while before my mother got sick again .|0
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today. Many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. From the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand.|1
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me chill bumps. This one did. Few horror movie give me a sense of dread. This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. It does.|1
given christopher nolan ' s string of successful films , it ' s a no brainer for me to want to check what he ' s so excited about ! i always knew there was more to this movie . however , even if i had known what he didn ' t say , the premise would have made me fall in love and lose my mind . i ' ll admit that i never really wanted to watch this as long as i ' ve seen it . anyway , i don ' t really get why anyone would be interested in watching this or how it could possibly make any sense of it at all .|0
Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it's must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, Jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme out was a very good choice.|1
"Was excited at the opening to hear part of ""Chevaliers De Sangreal"" but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks?"|1
i rented this one by accident . i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ` ` that was good . now i think we should just turn it off . there are times when an action movie sounds terrible , and even worse for me . in fact , it is awful because i am trying to write the script but ca n't really make much sense of it . every few moments i catch glimpses of another movie being made . if i wanted to have any other ideas i could have taken a different movie and tried it out .|0
i actually liked certain things about this game . i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had more time to look at what was on the floor , but that just is not going to happen . if you want to see a bad movie , watch this one ! i will be happy to give you a nice review of this film . i really appreciate your interest in this book . i think it would have made an excellent story line . the characters , however , do not seem to pay attention to the plot .|0
I'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS...) Why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. And how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...OK, OK...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity.|1
after watching this film , i thought to myself , they really glossed up errol flynn ' s life ! the movie was a bit of a joke , with a lot of jokes that made me think it had a great ending . i did n't care too much for the plot though , as i have seen lots of horror movies and could not see how this is going to be a bad movie . what good does it make ? i just watched one in which he tried to kill his friend and then killed himself while trying to escape from someone ' s house . wow !|0
journalist bob woodward ' s blistering , scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi ' s rise and fall becomes a reality . the characters in this story appear as not - human beings , but they are all well - being . it ' s an odd situation , that ' s for certain . we do not see very much similarity between humans and non - human beings . to many people it appears as if there were some sort of supernatural cult or cult . others seem to be more of an eccentric cult , which may be what is going on around here .|0
i always loved this film . the music , story and the action . i especially love the opening and ending . it has great lines and some great dialogue that goes down well . you just got to watch it and get an idea of how a movie can be put into any genre . for instance , this film is too fast paced and slow . no matter how fast you watch it , you do not really get it . you just follow along . it is boring and tedious . the main theme is what happened when the movie was made .|0
1st watched 7 / 19 / 2003 - 1 out of 10 ( dir - brad sykes ) : ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much makes me want to kill someone and leave my family alone . most people will agree that this one should have been an indie film , but when i read that they are going to make it a romantic movie , i thought it was ridiculous . i had never seen so many pornography movies in my life . if anyone wants to see a comedy , i will gladly take them up on the offer . i am not looking forward to viewing any of these films .|0
what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist off their ' good ' work on tv . these people do not know anything about real world life , nor do they seem to care at all for it . so why are they even thinking about going to a movie like this ? let 's just say it has been a huge waste of time . no , it should have been made by someone else . i think that this film is supposed to be fun . well , i guess we might as well watch it .|0
"I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. Turns out I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this motion picture like Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds to being a burnout. Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW). Like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention!"|1
first i must say that i enjoyed the first underworld movie . i was intrigued and curious to learn about this new series of characters . also i wanted to know about the names of the characters as they appeared in the movie . this book is so much fun ! after reading this , i am a little more than eager to give my opinion on this movie . however , this one is quite different . it sounds really dull . if you were to watch a thriller , you would think that it could not possibly have been better . then again , it could n't have been better .|0
"Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. Some have merely called the film ""contemplative"", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a Realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on."|1
This movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long, long while. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar.|1
there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but nothing like that . he even made me watch one with his own girlfriend . i thought we would get something to eat afterwards . she was on her way to the restaurant for a coffee break when she spotted me walking out of the apartment and immediately asked if i could accompany her . i told her no i wanted to go to my room so she would have time to finish her coffee . she gave me this ' do not ask ' look and went back into the apartment .|0
i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews . this has to be one of the worst movies ever written and for me to see it with my own eyes could not fathom a more perfect movie . if i had an opinion , i would never have chosen this place . i can not stand the feeling that some poor soul who is about to embark upon a new adventure is going to become stuck here when the end arrives . i can not say that i do not feel sorry for people who think this movie should get better , but i can say that the book was pretty lame .|0
the movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest . the movie had nothing exiting it , so what makes this movie unique ? there are very few places where a book is worth watching and none with a lot of action or humor in it . this movie could be considered a disaster if you choose to look at it from another perspective . i just ca n't understand why an author like brad pitt could enjoy such an awful movie that would cause even one of his favorites to end up getting ruined by some guy who only works as an assassin for a secret government agency .|0
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since that gay kid (Ben) came along, this show has sucked. The writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse.|1
sometimes , things should just not be made . and while the set - up seemed good enough , it proceeds to ruin the entire film . when i tried to re - create the movie , i ended up with only one piece of script . this was n't what i thought it would be . as far as i know , the movie is a work in progress . well , let me put it this way - the acting is very good . but my first thought is that the director ' s daughter is quite good , although she doesn ' t show her talent for any real purpose .|0
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a.|1
i was a huge fan of this series . yesterday i watched it again on dvd . i was apprehensive to watch it because it was one of the worst scenes i 've seen in the last 20 years . the characters are horrible and stupid . all they wanted to do was get the job done . this film , like most of the others , had an unimaginative plot - not much worth watching , but pretty damn good , too . it was a waste of money ( at least that is how i remember it ) . the only way you would know this was if you watched it with someone who enjoyed it .|0
If you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating... but I cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way Paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad the way Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life?|1
yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies . we picked ` ` ik ook van ' because this movie has some really interesting character - flick about a guy who 's lost his life and lives in the dark . we also thought it was a bad idea to let them see this , so i think they will be more receptive when they see the movie and maybe they might even come up for air . that was very good ! i never thought i would like this movie , especially in the daytime , but i am really happy i did not enjoy it as much as i should have .|0
"In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of ""men off the street"" expounding on the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all."|1
i ' m a next generation person . . . i ' ve never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about them . one thing is certain , though : these people don ' t make any kind of sense . as far as anyone can tell , everything that comes out of this movie is either a comedy or some kind of science fiction . the story seems to consist mostly of a bunch of scientists trying to figure out something that just doesn ' t add up . the fact that they did not include me in the entire episode makes me doubt that there was ever anything good about this film .|0
I never read the book. Now I don't really want to. I had no clue what this movie was about when I walked into the theatre. I still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but I do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. Two precious hours I can never get back.The storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. Werewolves...or something...a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. And I was correct.The acting isn't horrible.|1
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that bad, which I felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very Bad. There were songs & songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown Germans speaking English which is so rubbish. Germans does not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have gave some money to her) In the promo they have shown prepare for Laughing riot.|1
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies. It was all downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David.|1
All right, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. That's the first thing that's wrong with RL, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission?|1
go to the video store and get the original . i do not understand why hollywood has that need to make films where so much drama goes on , but it must . this movie was one of the most difficult films i have ever seen . well , let us begin with a film of my own making ; it starts out as a boring movie about a guy who lives in a very small town in upstate new york . he just got divorced and wants to see a woman . after watching this film , i really had no interest in it .|0
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. I guess I didn't feel really for the kids. I totally can understand what their gripes were and I know how poor the state of schools are, but I found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. If this comes on TV, don't waste your time. Watch Short Circuit again for the 235th time.|1
ok , everybody agreed on what was the best season . the first . and killing off boone was a bad idea in the long run . for one thing , nobody had thought it through enough to get this movie on the list . no good could come out of it . why do people just keep coming up with the same answer ? you know your worst fears will never be confirmed . the only reason anyone came up with this movie was so many others would not admit that there was a connection between it and the murder of todd hopkins .|0
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). Julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London on its release. However Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not.|1
"""The Racketeer"" stars Carol (deprived of the ""e"" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines."|1
when the word ` ` presents ' ' finds its way into a title , preceded by a famous name , the novel begins . i was told to watch for it , and you would have to be very careful not to fall asleep before the final chapter . this novel is called ' the third book ' . the story of the first person in the plot is one of those that really seems to make me wonder whether or not the characters were made up . if you are a movie writer , you must have seen all the best movies in the whole wide world .|0
this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. I've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. This show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. I dislike that crap..i have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. The 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. I seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up.|1
the story line of a man ' s love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on a diet which does not even allow him to enjoy it . i have decided that this is as good a time as any to tell you about my experiences . at the beginning , after reading the rest of the book i was so happy that i almost forgot what i was supposed to do . then there were the first three chapters , which are so boring , that i just kept trying to keep the boredom out of it .|0
an absorbing exploration of virtual reality , although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended . i have heard that the creators of the series were very excited to write this , but they did not take their work seriously at all . i was surprised as to whether there were some similarities between the first two books and the second one . i have never actually been able to tell if they are a result of their respective storylines or if they are simply made up by other people who are having a bad time of doing so .|0
If this movie would have been in English, all critics would have trashed it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. After the movie I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla!|1
The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie.|1
i ' ve never been a big larry clark fan , but somehow , i ' ve been dragged to almost every movie on the planet ( not that there were many of those ) . it always seemed like we were constantly looking out for each other by our own stupidity and bad taste , which is why we had a lot of extra hours to ourselves . in my mind , this movie was supposed to be about how you ' ll spend your vacation if you can just make it all seem fun and boring . instead , it turned out that it was very disappointing and dull .|0
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England. It is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'Technical Aspects' of the IMDb site.|1
for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie , another payday in l . a . for a good movie . my first year of film i had a bad week at school . one day i got a new video , an original , that i would like to give to my girlfriend . she did n't like it very much , just made me turn it off . but i am not proud of how i treated myself , and after reading this one i can see why . i do n't think anyone else could have done it any better .|0
aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema . here is one good example of this movie : i have seen it first - hand . i remember the scene well from when i was just about sixteen years old and my parents took a vacation to europe and came back to australia . they had been traveling for a few days and were very sick , so we decided to spend time with their friends . i remember that film perfectly because there is no reason to watch it again ; not unless you want to make sure that you know what you are missing .|0
you do n ' t have to spend much time watching this made for tv movie or series pilot or whatever it was . in the past few years there have been some bad movies , but they all seem harmless . at least nobody has actually shot any of them ! i mean , why on earth are they making such crap like this now anyway ? oh yeah , because that 's where they got their fame and fortune from . so , when you watch a show about a zombie apocalypse , it makes you want to puke . as long as you 're not watching it , everything seems okay .|0
hahahahah probably one of the funniest movies i ' ve even seen . obviously this is n ' t intentional though . it ' s all just a joke and no one was listening . i found out later there was a group of kids who are in some sort of martial arts competition at school . i watched the first film with my camera for a short time and i didn ' t get anything good . i felt sorry for the kid that got his face slashed off , because he seemed so easy to deal with and yet could n't handle it .|0
when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv . i just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie and realized there was absolutely nothing about it in this movie to be proud of . i looked forward to finding something with a bit more flair than this , but that never happened . it was pretty disappointing , really . if you 're going to have one who is as good at acting as i am , you can probably afford to waste your time watching this movie . i do n't see any other action scenes coming out of this movie so i decided to get a little entertainment for myself .|0
... but had to see just how bad it could get. The plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. A female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. The surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'Lesbian Conspiracy'. The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby.|1
` ` escape from hell ' ' is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation . ' you might say it 's the worst script in the book , but do n't believe that . the plot is so good , and the words were so good , you 'd have liked it . i was there at the beginning of the film . this film is about getting into your ex - boyfriend / boyfriend / girlfriend situation and making sure that you never see him ( or anyone ) ever again , because he has some huge issues of his own .|0
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of The Demons to beat the dastardly Falcon team who always seems to win at this camp I guess. This being a typical clichéd '80's teen (lame) sex comedy who do you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness. Oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the camp of course).|1
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie this is down right awful. After reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews were so right. I totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow.|1
"whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely . the lone ranger is not camp , but ` ` this is the movie with the characters ' . it would only be a horror movie if they were n't so much like each other . and i mean that ! "" he looked at the camera . "" we are all watching this film because there is no other way to put it . "" the camera went away from the audience and moved onto the set in front of the director . you had to make your best effort to watch the acting ."|0
If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then, compared to now.|1
"I was surprised to like this movie since I'm from the ""check your brain at the door and have fun"" school of film viewing. However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like unsocialized Evie. And I've been in Evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with Evie were raw and painful to watch."|1
marked for death ( 1990 ) spends more time on action sequences , than it does with focusing on its actual purpose . the film is just like any other comedy , with lots of plot and plenty of characters . there is a big difference between those two movies and the ones i saw earlier in the film . the first thing that i am shocked to see as i entered this film was how many characters could have been in it . why did n't you say so before ? ! the second movie is bad enough , but the ' good actors ' had no clue about their roles .|0
the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns . have a good christmas , dear reader . i am looking forward to reading some of your stories as well as listening to what you are going to write about . if you find any similarities then please tell me and i will make sure you read them . otherwise , it would be great for you to get feedback from me on the story itself . do not give up yet . if you are interested , you may go to my site and download the last three chapters of the novel .|0
did people expect ` ` jurassic park 3 ' ' to be full of surprises ? not one moment of it is interesting , and the whole thing makes me sick . why do we have to put ourselves through this sort of work for a couple of weeks ? because every second of the show is just that ; a farce . i thought you knew how to take a joke . well , this movie is very funny , especially if the audience is willing to share their humor in the process . so there i was having fun while listening to other people make silly jokes about us .|0
11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb . there is a reason the original film was first released in 1997 , but i think that one should not say it . some of these films were never completed . some were made in 2004 , others in ' 69 or ' 86 . all of the early movies are now available on imdb and most are based on current movies . it does n't take a great deal of research on what to look for in each of those cases .|0
so i caught this one afternoon as ` ` what lies above ' ' and actually watched it because the beginning was great , the end was very bad and the final result was absolutely awful , but there was not a thing about this that i did not enjoy . the worst part is how you can see something wrong with this film in such a way that makes it difficult to get anything positive out of it . the first half of the film could be considered good , but after reading all the lines and subtitles and the ending of the screenplay we are going to find that the movie was simply boring .|0
i am a huge eric roberts fan , i collect his movies and so far has get to 60 . he is one of the better looking guys in hollywood but he is a bit of a pushover at times . however , not many people can pull off an 80 - year - old look like him . why would anyone want to spend a lot of time on makeup and hair ? i have seen enough film stars to know when a guy who looks exactly like him wants to be alone with them , they have to be a lot more talented than that .|0
dear readers , 2001 : a space odyssey is kubrick at his best . . . although i really ca n ' t say how they do this , they ' re the worst characters i ever read . if i thought it was good before , i didn ' t like it even less as it progresses to the second installment of the series . i think about all of the ways it could have been made better by someone else doing it . i ' d like to suggest that the film itself would have made a lot better in some ways than this .|0
This is an astonishingly bad action film. I'd say its primary flaw is that it's BORING. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set design, and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. Mod Squad's second (major) flaw is its lack of character development--underscored by the actors' lack of talent. I tend to like Claire Danes's work so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully miscast: how could his cotton-mouthed, bumbling acting style possibly fit into an ACTION flick?|1
"Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or ""artsy fartsy"" as some people would say. I assure you, that after one viewing, ""Bobbycrush"" will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film."|1
. . . with a 500 $ budget and a bottle of ketchup . if you are a fan of c movies with no romance in the title , then it should be ok . i can not believe i am actually considering it . so much for my dream of being a movie producer and all that . i do not know where to start . when i started making this film , i found that i just could not believe what was happening . there is something strange about it and i did n't have any idea what it meant until after it was done .|0
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen, and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death.The story begins with introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie.Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named ""Summerfest"". In this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class."|1
from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again . this movie is still part - and a schoolbook example of it . what 's more , although i have n't even seen it , i am absolutely sure it was meant for people to see because they had been looking at a lot of the same films in their own home . the plot may have been good , but i would have never believed that any kind of comedy could make a film as well as this . we were watching a film about a war in afghanistan , with an army of american soldiers who wanted to stop the enemy .|0
"i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 . not only because of the psychological horror ( of which , you will recall , i have read more than one ) but also because of the subtitles , especially the ones that say : "" what happens when people are killed by someone who really does n't deserve to be murdered ? "" as far as i could tell there was no such person . it did not make any sense . i saw so many movies in my youth that i even thought about just making a few films and having them all make sense ."|0
This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence.|1
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself. The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart.' The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from. Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie. I expected a sort of crappy, direct-to-video version of `Heathers' targeted at the teenagers of today.Let me tell you what `Tart' was really about.|1
I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot.|1
george hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great . i ' ve heard of such a movie before , even though no one ever paid much attention to it as a kid . the story is based on an old man who believes in santa claus or something . but i ' m going to recommend the movie to you because i believe you are a real fan . it had better be good . i hope you like it . so how bad would it be for me if i go with you ? i could write my own review about it .|0
what on earth happened to rgv ? there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to look away for a moment or two before it goes into overdrive and starts shooting , and you can still see some of the most horrific scenes from this series . if you have n't seen the movie yet , then why did you sign on to start writing it ? well , first of all , let me ask you this : how do you spend enough time in the field to get along with your fellow soldiers ? we are not going to be able to write much about the film .|0
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting.|1
there is a difference between a ` ` film , ' ' and a ` ` movie . ' ' a film , regardless of any genre , is one of the most important things that anyone has ever produced in this world . this is an epic novel which was written by a very talented publisher . i think you can say it came out of its box at the worst possible speed . to be honest with you , these novels did n't do well . we saw more films because of the good quality of the script . they were like a lot of the best movies i had ever seen .|0
i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher was n ' t involved with this ` ` movie ' ' . an episode of the bad boy comes on , and you ' ve seen it before . no , what is interesting is that one of the most exciting scenes in the series can not be shown during the movie ! this is the first time i noticed that this movie was really funny . it must have taken a genius to do this . well , i still thought the story was ridiculous , but the plot came off reasonably well , if you ' re into old movies .|0
i usually do n ' t categorize a moving as boring . i am not big on action flicks and my senses are much better in the movies than any other sci - fi character . i was thinking about what to watch that did not seem exciting . it was n't , but i had an inkling this one would have . i was looking for something that would be interesting , but i got nothing . the first two episodes were almost identical to this one ; a man with his back to a large rock and three women attacking him .|0
this is one of the stupidest movies ever , not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest . i 've seen so many crappy films over the past twenty years that sometimes it 's hard to tell who is watching the film in person and who is actually seeing what is going on through the camera . for example , here is this movie where an actor comes to see his brother in a jail cell before they go out on a bail date ( or a parole ) . there he is , pleading with their sister to stop him from murdering them , and then having his brother killed too .|0
this demented left - wing wipe - out trivializes dante ' s great work , distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition . now let 's make a note : i didn ' t even think about the title of this story , let alone that it will have any historical value to me . i just want to thank you for being so helpful in writing this book . please write a review at the retailer ' s website which you can be assured is going to take care of the books that you are using as an audience .|0
i saw one life stand when it premiered at the 2000 edinburgh international film festival and was blown away by how beautiful it was in that movie . a man who had never worked in a movie for a long time and was not impressed by any of its characters , seemed to take some kind of pleasure in watching it because there was so much angst and despair being expressed from the actors . the fact that most of these actors did n't have an ounce of self - esteem made me think they could have done better if they had had all those years of experience .|0
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.|1
Yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. The acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst i have ever seen. It is a very low budget movie. There is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. Mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol.|1
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me.|1
"I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the ""secret base"" was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors."|1
i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys . as it turned out , the boy / girl duo is not even remotely similar - but both are from the same country . so i thought they should have an early christmas present and make the best of it . it 's not that they were n't good to be friends with all three of these boys , either , it 's just that neither of them were particularly attractive . after seeing them in action , i do believe they may have been more popular back then than they were now .|0
i ' ve lost count of the times i have seen this movie , but i love it and find it rather amusing . i just ca ' t believe it was only two months ago . i don ' t even know what to say to her now that she has made a film about my brother and me in italy . how can it be so hard to like this movie ? there were all kinds of interesting things going on in the movie , but none of them had much impact on the plot . not one single thing could have come close to the whole thing .|0
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women). From opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure.Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom.|1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were Greek or Italian so I guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.|1
this gundam series only follows gundam 0083 stardust memory . the story takes place during the same time line as the previous movie , but it turns out i am wrong ; gundam is actually a fictional character that has been exposed to so little attention over the last thirty or forty years . for all intents and purposes , he has always been one of hollywood 's leading men : a career actor , an actor , a comedian , a writer , a photographer , and just about anyone else with a degree in psychology . unfortunately , he also spent most of his life trying to imitate someone who would play him .|0
i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom . i look here on imdb , even though it is only 2 hours old , this is the most boring movie i have ever watched . after a few minutes ( i am not really sure how long when i was asleep or maybe i was in my coma - like state ) someone puts a dvd in and turns up the tv . i ca n't say for sure , but i think there were about 5 minutes between every action movie i have ever watched in my life .|0
This film did not excite me. While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.One thing that I did not quite follow is how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.The other thing that I did not particularly like was the missing segment of Khan's life. It did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long.|1
after the failure of ` ` hellraiser iii : hell on earth , ' ' the chapter that served as a kind of entertainment is nothing compared to what we have done over the past twenty years . no one else would even consider acting this way ; they thought it was too far - fetched . but when you read the first scene , i think you will see why it was not a total waste of time . every actor has to write down the script and the actors themselves before they are able to make any major changes . some actors are good actors , while others are not .|0
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. It's honestly that bad. I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite.|1
"down periscope is not a ` ` great movie ' ' . but then again very few flicks are . so if i were you i would make a comment on "" the wizard "" as one of my favorites ( for this reason alone it does not seem likely that i would get much use out of this film even if i was actually reading it ) . when i was a young man , i thought that i was ready to learn everything about hollywood . i could only imagine how many people were trying to tell me that they just wanted to go to bed early ."|0
a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict . the movie is one of the funniest , most awesome movies on earth . for me it 's really hard to watch , i just do n't understand why my brother has to be so obsessed with these characters . i mean we are all young people and he is only twenty - one but his acting is bad . he can make a lot of money playing this character but he should have a serious talent . i remember that night well because i am in the kitchen having a nice cup of tea when the door opened .|0
"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might."|1
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection - - - hilarity , truth , fun , suspense . i 'm going to give it a pass . it is n't my fault that i have no imagination at all when it comes to the characters . for instance : what do they look like ? what type of car is that ? and how did you get so far out of town by just sitting around waiting for somebody to appear ? what does everybody expect to happen in this movie ? why should everyone expect someone to turn up at the house on christmas day ?|0
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 yrs at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store the old lady was at. However, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it hasn't been already. A bit of trivia, Illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals.|1
"""The Cave"" got released more or less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk."|1
this is one of the strangest things on tv . it is set in a bizarrely underpopulated midlands superb called london ( or , at least , as it should be said , london ' s perfect example of nothing better than an irish pub ! ) but there is no way that it can be the real thing . if you go all the way down to paris , you come across the world by visiting a cinema and they tell you about it . i do not know much about any of the other countries where films like these are filmed .|0
I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot.|1
"while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i thought , "" holy crap this is so awesome . i love this story ! "" chapter 1 
 in a house that was not really much more than a dump it was actually nice to see what people were doing over at the time of the filming . i mean how many times have you watched a movie where one person acts like they are doing something just because he is trying to be funny instead of just having some fun ?"|0
This movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. And the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time.|1
hitchcock ' s original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of , but also the ' look ' of anthony bisset and richard gere . if you are looking for someone who might be able to relate to this movie , let me say that it ' s nothing like what we ' ve seen on any of the other channels . most people just watch them on their radio - or in films . it ' s not very exciting . when i first read this movie back in 1997 , i didn ' t think a single person had ever heard the story so well before .|0
i lay the blame for the comebacks on anyone who enjoyed date movie and epic movie . you people encouraged me to watch these books because you thought it would be fun . so , please read the first two chapters of horror . i hope they will be entertaining . this book is nothing but bad movies that are very funny . there is not a single thing to be found in them . the characters are boring and the plot is as flat as one of those tv shows . i hate the way it makes you feel when you have a crush on someone even if she is acting like one .|0
"This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. I did actually read Gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. That angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. Above all this movie just leaves me asking ""WHY?"" Why do we see, as someone else aptly put, ""The Real World: Tudor England""?"|1
"For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ""Rosemarys Baby"" is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan."|1
"Well, after seeing ""Beginning"" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing ""Dominion"" I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better.Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. But there is so much little of it in the movie."|1
"Jennifer Montgomery's ""Art for Teachers of Children"" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here?"|1
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermellons, people, etc. This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to.The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV.What is Phase IV?|1
first , and foremost , i take issue to the title of this movie . ' chupacabra ' is not a word in which i particularly enjoy reading . it 's not an original story , and most of the plot does not seem like anything you would expect someone to use in a good movie . some of these films are really ridiculous , with little more than a sentence on each film . i think about that for a minute as we walk out of the store . i thought it might be nice if people were paying attention to what they were writing instead of the movies themselves .|0
i ca n ' t disagree with a previous comment that ` ` driving lessons ' ' is more than a little twee , but if you have no appreciation of the nuances of it , maybe you should just let me quote it to you on this program . it will probably be pretty boring , but it is a very good example of how far out of tune an adult can be in the field of computer programming . when i first read this program , it was my own idea of a way to save money and earn myself a few extra bucks .|0
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 ""Musical Thriller"" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to ""shield her from all the evils of the world."" The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where Todd is concerned."|1
originally , the spiders was planned as a four - part serial , and it shows . i dislike serials ; they are so hard to watch . but i did see one episode which showed a young couple being forced to take their daughter on a date with a man that is in the same condition as her . this is a bad movie . it has some terrible elements of a lot of horrible things that you can not wait to see . there was nothing pretty about this movie other than the fact that there was an overlap between the first scene of the movie and then the second scene .|0
this is , per se , an above average film but why in the name of bog was it made to start with ? let me say this : there are several reasons why this movie should never have developed . first , i think they were created to please people , not to prove that they can . if you do not believe me , go to the source . no one wants to know what it really is . second , just because the plot is good - looking does n't mean that the plot is dumb or stupid . it just proves that the story is a failure .|0
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie.|1
one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way : i was n't allowed to watch the movie ! it 's not a crime to watch an action film , although you will find yourself disappointed in some ways once you see the movie on dvd . most of the movies that make it look and feel like something is wrong with the movie have a very good ending . but this film is even better than all the others ' . this movie does not care what kind of characters it wants to show up in .|0
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him, that earthy, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go.But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just isn't.It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven, its point of view is muddled, the acting is all over the board, from naturalistic to over the top.|1
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all.According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being Percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the Pimpernel, but here he just looks bored asPercy and mean as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, andElizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat.|1
imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other . that was n't fair at all , because this was a film . i also had no idea who or what could be going to get the worst result for it . these people are terrible . i did not write this movie ; i do n't know what is worse , being called in for a job or having to spend the day watching television . i would prefer to have something nice to say about it . well , this film is just awful !|0
"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species."|1
I saw this film when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed 2 or three times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous/poorly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed at the performance of Larry Bagby , whom I usually find entertaining. If you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film. Then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts.|1
Man, what an awful film. As with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. Come on!|1
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again.|1
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich, and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly prejudiced against the 'goy' characters -- content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures -- and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with.Feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine, and start dealing honestly with issues.|1
very enjoyable 50 ' s western . i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans . mostly victor mature ( the first 20 - 30 % of the series that is ) . this one has been made up of a lot of great characters , so if there is something like this film on your favorite tv show , please do n't go out of your way to find out who is behind it . you would not be able to even begin to find out how long they were together after he had gone off to prison . at least $ 1.95 a day is really cheap .|0
if you enjoy suspense this movie has it . the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her appeal . she seems like she 's in a parallel world - one where there is nothing at all going on in her life , so i feel confident that she will eventually lead us somewhere . i wish i could make it back to the present but i have to watch these movies from start to finish again . it would take a long time to get used to them and i still feel like they should be played by someone bigger than me .|0
i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto . the actors are beautiful and the plot is hilarious , but i just ca n't picture them being that good - looking . it all ends up being a very boring thing that i hate . no wonder most of my customers do not like these movies . they really must be made to look bad . if i am in this movie , you can imagine why i do not like this film . i get on the stage and sit in a chair and watch the actors go about their day .|0
"The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's ""Nine Lives"" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect."|1
i do not like himesh reshamiya . i do not like his singing too . but his songs are a waste of money . and his music is so dull and uninteresting that i should not have noticed it at all . maybe it makes me feel better , but what if it is some type of mental disease ? the only thing that makes me feel better is seeing this guy play his guitar in the middle of an enormous theater on a saturday afternoon ! he has the greatest voice ever , and the way he sings makes it sound as if he is singing to a group of people instead of a single song .|0
Please do not go see this. I did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes into this.I would suggest never seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was awful.|1
"i really wanted to like this movie . great cast walter pidgeon in a role that reminds us of the old , boring movies . but this one was so much better . if only he were here , he could have taken my advice and not made me listen to it .

I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATED this film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol.|1
"ok , when i say ` ` wow , ' ' i mean , ` ` jesus , please help me . ' ' i am sorry , but it is very important that i tell you to stop . ' the problem with this one is that nobody will even remember it . not even a little bit about what happened to it , which seems like a great example of some kind of stupid joke . "" mark said , "" well , thank you for your time , "" and started walking away . the other three people were still talking when he got into his car ."|0
Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the rabbit's hole. So Bug's has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one, if still shorn of a classic.|1
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoke the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap.|1
brilliant actors and brilliant picture ! ! i love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning , it was so bad , i really did not like it all . but as i looked at the rest of the set i had a great idea . first things first . no more movies that come out when this film is released . please do n't say that you ' d like to see any other movies on dvd . i ' ll be disappointed if you don ' t give me the money to put down some money . let me finish . just one thing .|0
"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere)."|1
this movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship . not one review described any of the characters . what was there to say , anyway ? they were dumb , shallow people who thought they could make their own movies . why does it take so much work to come out on top ? i do n't think i would have picked this movie if i thought i might be able to enjoy it , but it seems like a waste of time . let 's watch this movie in an hour . how am i going to kill myself when you die ?|0

A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.|1
if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv , try watching the ' 80s . it 's not that bad , really . when i first started watching the movie i was so used to watching this kind of movie for weeks , months or years , but in a few short hours my mind became so engrossed with this movie that i barely registered what was happening in front of me . i had already seen more than i care to recall about the series of episodes where people go through the whole thing without any effort .|0
"When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You're in for dark, harrowing films like ""Alice"" and ""Little Otik,"" or short gems such as ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky."" All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."|1
when moviegoers hear two popular villains / characters will be fighting , they flock to the theaters to see how the battle goes . so much so that when i heard it , i decided to take a look at the movie myself . there are n't enough action movies to know who is being attacked by whom . one of the main points of this movie is that the first time i saw this movie was in 2005 . during this film i did not recognize the character ; it was hard to place them from my mind and i think i am trying very hard , but i really had no problem seeing these characters .|0
the inspiration for the ` ` naked gun ' ' movies casts leslie nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy in this movie . at first she did a decent job and it was not very good . we all wanted to take this movie home but after a few weeks , people started talking about what they thought was the greatest movie ever made . now , when i saw this movie , i was surprised at the number of people who really wanted to see it . unfortunately , there were some of them who found it so bad that they would not go near it .|0
Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers.|1
jacqueline hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is . everyone likes her , so you could see how nice she is . there is something about the way she takes control of her movie which makes me want to stay away from her as much as i do at any one time . the main reason for this character has nothing to do with whether or not the movie was made in 1940 . we are only trying to find out why people would buy a tv like this .|0
I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. etc. Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie?|1
"Though it's a Christmas movie, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby."|1
there ' s not a dull moment in francois ozon ' s ` ` robe d ' ete ' ' . it ' s surprising how much this film is worth - especially for a young man who was only seventeen when it first appeared . i felt like i was witnessing the story of the world on tv . i ' ve never seen this film , so it doesn ' t even make any kind of sense , but i had to see the film with my eyes because i couldn ' t help thinking that i wasn ' t going to die if i watched this film and took a second look at those pictures .|0
this movie is amazing . you will never laugh harder . it ' s a target . no , i think that one would have been better if the movie had a sequel and not some horror story about an alien in the next planet . i ' m just not willing to watch it . as much as i enjoy this book , at times i try to find ways to avoid watching it . there really wasn ' t any real interest in it . i tried to make the movie interesting by trying to do a background on the aliens and how they were able to live among us .|0
"this is one of l & h ' s shorts most frequently cited as the first ` ` real ' ' l & h ' . and for a brief moment i was reminded that there are times when you just forget that they have no concept of life in any form , and yet you still get to enjoy it with the best of them . but if you want to enjoy your own life while doing so , you should not attempt to do so until you find a new way to watch it . the "" real "" version is usually pretty good and generally follows the main story ."|0
sappy . i liked how they went to the ` ` haaavaad baaa ' ' to quote books at each other to impress the public and then left it behind for the masses , as a joke of some sort . i could n't understand how anyone could say that a movie can be such a waste of money - no matter what movies we see ! there has to be some reason people are afraid of guns , especially handguns . but this one is just plain awful . the film was really bad , which was fine by me . but my mind kept going back to the scene of the accident .|0
"When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it ""the greatest achievement in the history of the American cinema."" That was not wholly tongue in cheek. TW&TL remains Milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. However, TW&TL remains a striking exposition of what once was known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's superb portrayal of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius--and Keith--admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including ""The Rough Riders."")"|1
i have read each and every one of baroness orczy ' s scarlet pimpernel books . counting this one , i must say that the characters are just about as interesting as any of the movies i have seen . the most entertaining part of this series consists of a rather bizarre set of characters which make no sense to me . after reading this movie , i found myself starting to think that i will have to watch this movie until the very end . i ' m beginning to wonder if you ' re having any fun watching this film .|0

a few years ago i saw the scent of green papayas by the same director . my feelings about both were somewhat displaced , and it was only later when i read the story that i began to realize how stupid i must have sounded . i also noticed that for some unknown reason , this guy was n't quite what i would call handsome . in fact , he was not even attractive at all ! his skin tone was very white and his facial structure was very small - much like mine . his eyes were extremely dark , and you could tell from the way he moved that he was a smoker .|0
` ` the moon is blue ' ' director otto preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release , which turned on the tv . as an example , i had to admit that this was one of the biggest and worst movies i 've ever watched . i hated it ( because it made me think about my parents ' relationship ) , but i could n't stop thinking about their lives , their jobs , and their dreams . what would they say if they were able to see this ? would they be surprised or embarrassed ?|0
` ` no one really knows how the power came to be . not even the book of damnation recorded its story . it was just there for those to read , but we can all agree that they were much more powerful and dangerous than the book could ever hope to be . why do you ask ? ' ` as a historian , ' said the general , ` i have come to see that some people are actually willing to believe in their own gods , rather than try to get them to tell the truth .|0
Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in New York. These are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. They exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is appears somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from ? How did they get there ? How do they cope ? Where will they end up ?|1
OK, so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er, sorry . . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So sue me. I spent my whole Saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. I can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie I'd never seen, rather than read Proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.Which is to say, I didn't deserve Open Graves. Of which I saw none, incidentally. Were there any? Did I fall asleep?|1
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences.|1
"This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work depicts. Ward and Dalton aren't so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince. She was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward ""Why can't I move you?"""|1
this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time . the kind of title that ruins your dreams , yet you continue to sleep with it for the next five minutes and then turn it off afterwards . if you could see the screen , it would probably be even more terrifying than the movie , as it was made by one of the worst characters i have ever heard of . while the film is not nearly as long as this , there are a few excellent scenes where people get in each other 's way .|0
i am an australian currently living in japan . i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed . it 's one of those movies about the japanese being the last people to see the pacific ocean or the pacific ocean as we know it now , so i figured it would be fun if i watched it while i was there . however , since i was in japan and not in australia , i have been watching this movie for a while . i hope they do n't give that up . i just wish i had some friends who actually knew what was going on when i was away .|0
"the plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well . there is a plenty of detail in the plot that you just ca n't miss . however , we have to look at other scenes from previous years . i am looking forward to hearing about the movie later on this summer . let 's get something going with the characters and / or characters . here are some ideas . one of these are : 
 1 . what is the most popular story for an independent writer ? 2 . where do the stories come from ? 3 . when do they happen ?"|0
"` ` tragic hero ' ' is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films , focusing more on the movie than anything else . unfortunately , it can only provide one feature of how this movie was created : 
 "" i saw this movie when i was at my university in new york , and you guys were just so much worse than what i had originally thought . these two characters were actors from another time , and the acting was horrible . for starters , they did n't even make the movie as romantic as the movies portrayed ."|0
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination, dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now playing at select theaters near you. Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look away.For rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.|1
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine.|1
i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful ! awfully long - even though they managed to create something . you have to realize that the plot is terrible , and there are no clues as to its real purpose or why people want to do such a terrible thing . the whole thing made me sad , because i felt sorry for someone who had just been in the same situation . i feel ashamed now for letting my little friend ' s life get so bad that i decided to make sure he gets better after the movie .|0
part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare ' s classic plays , this version of hamlet does nothing to provide an audience with any sense of emotion . it is basically a film based on only being a small - time character . one of the main reasons that hamlet was cast in the first place was because of the way he looked and his mannerisms . i can quote hamlet very well ; he was a man who could act like a hollywood movie star . as far as i knew , he could n't play a single acting role , and neither could any of his actors .|0
"i think hollywood should seriously consider never doing another ` ` biblical ' ' film again , if noah ' s ark is any good . the bible does not have the energy for this one , it just makes it seem like it ' s some kind of big book . we do n't believe in "" jesus "" and there ' s little to no redeeming character or story . the only thing that really impresses us about this movie is the fact that it plays by a script that sounds so lame . why would anyone put themselves on the stage to watch a movie that is stupid ?"|0
if you ' re like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies ( i guess it ' s kind of like a bad flick ) , please try not to laugh . there will be many other comedies that do not go on as they should . no matter where you come from , you always find something in this movie that is funny but not even remotely funny . the plot is unfunny . the lighting is awful and the dialogue is terrible . the character is obviously retarded and her characters are totally lacking in imagination . what a waste of a good movie .|0
` ` tumbling doll of flesh ' ' by tamakichi anaru is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse , rape , and generally torture each other in order to scare others . the film was not quite as interesting as i had imagined it would be , but it was certainly one of the worse films i had ever seen . how on earth could they live through something like this ? it was just plain mean . i did n't have much sympathy with them . however , if you are wondering what happened to the movie - well , that has nothing whatsoever to do with me personally .|0
I didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. It was a particularly great scene when Feck(Dennis Hopper) and John(Daniel Roebuck) are talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why.|1
i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie . it was so horrible that i turned it off at first , thinking it would make me feel better about the situation . on the outside i was being a good host , but inside i was making sure not to get too close to others . there were people who needed saving and yet none of them were allowed to live without a body . i never got to hear how the whole story was made up , because all i had to see was a bunch of bodies lying around .|0
ok , so maybe it ' s because i ' m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like a british detective . but there ' s no reason for me to be such an uninteresting character . you can only really enjoy the best movies in films that are done by someone who is watching them . i was born with this bad acting habit . when i ' ve been on the wrong stage or seen a bad movie i have often wondered how it got here . my parents wouldn ' t want me to go on a holiday because my mom said she wanted to make me do something fun again .|0
i am sitting here writing this review and the movie ' s not even over yet . in fact , i can hardly wait to get back to my old life . after watching a series of similar movies as the previous ones , i realized that we are just not ready for anything like this . let me tell you something . i watched a film that i was told had a good ending and a nice ending . i was so happy that i could almost fall asleep . there were lots of wonderful scenes and i loved all of them .|0
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is.|1
This is one of the best action films I have seen. Geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'Charly'/gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'Stuart Little'.|1
i agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull . i found myself disliking the whole film as well . but after a period like this , i am glad that i read the reviews . the main characters are not even worth reading . i would suggest that all the action is taken by those who care about such things . for example , there may be some great plot twists and minor characters , but it will be much better if the story is left in its own private genre , or at least one without a character involved .|0
WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!! !Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.1. Never, ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away.|1
I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. They just don't make shows like this anymore, do they?|1
watching the first few moments , you realize it ' s going to be a parody - and certainly it * of an empty house . this is the place i would have liked to write a book on . i ' m not saying that there is anything good about it . no , the characters were all alike in most ways . some of them were both arrogant , some of them downright stupid , but all of them held the same goals . so , what am i reading here ? if you want to read one of my books , you should have picked up a copy from your favorite library .|0
"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing."|1
this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong nicolas cage fan . i love it because it shows so much of how people think . if you do n't like it then you can get out . at least that way i would know i was good at something , even if the actors could not tell me what they are doing . the acting is very good . the storylines are not bad . the dialog is fairly decent , but it is only based on what the reader may be looking for .|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well I was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. I was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. They just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. I hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this Motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. And they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware Laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people..|1
"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting."|1
**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake.|1
the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video . it features passable acting , but you might find it somewhat boring after a while ... and this movie is definitely a little too early in your career to have made its debut in the mid - 1990 ' 90s . i wish i had some other stories to share about this film . i could at least start with something of value . first off , if you can tell how much money i 've wasted trying to be successful in this movie then i would really appreciate it . so let me get this right .|0
i can see that the ratings for this film are n ' t all that high for this film , so i have a feeling this film is as much of an obsession to them as anyone else in the industry . it 's like watching the tv version of star trek instead of being able to watch it on dvd because i really want to do this . and believe me when i say there is something completely unsexy about seeing someone make out with another woman . especially when they do not have any clothes on . you can just hear the women screaming and cursing at each other after they get home from the movie .|0
"this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen . and believe me , i have seen a lot worse . but this movie was not what you would call "" boring "" . it was bad . really , really bad ! there are some great movies in that movie ; however , they all just go too far . at least one character has been horribly abused by his handlers . it was even worse than when you were sent to prison . as my favorite movie critic , i always think i saw something like this film . it did not make any sense whatsoever ."|0
it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie ( you do n ' t have to throw cartloads of money away on movies , so what 's the point ) . however , there was nothing to complain about . the actors did most of the talking , and the dialogue was just too bad to say anything interesting . if you wanna see a funny movie then watch this one , it 's not worth it . i mean in this case it really wasn ' t funny at all . there were only two characters in it , a girl and a boy .|0
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA), Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look.|1
Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. When in theory we should be watching for the narrative.The plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!|1
this is a wonderful comedy short - - one of keaton ' s absolute best . through a long series of silly and nonsensical stunts , they all seemed to come to an end in a single evening . the following night there are a bunch of other funny characters who appear to be really good actors and make no effort to see the movie . the only person i can say for certain that these guys really did act well with their character is paul boondoggle . he is a poor actor who spends most of his time doing horrible things and not making any real sense to anyone .|0

I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great, very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep, he wrote it in 2:45.|1
What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump?|1
carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the ' black hole ' . although it does n't feel as if it were bad , there is no point in acting anymore , since i do n't really have anything against films at all . they 're a waste of time , and i really do not want to watch any more of them . why do i even care ? i guess i just like the movie . i just wish i could look back and be able to appreciate the way it felt on the other dvd .|0
UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia.John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property.|1
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. This can be pretty annoying.Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to Duchamp's ready mades. What's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Julio Iglesias.|1
you can take the crook out of the joint , but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out . i have an opinion on a number of issues , and i think there could be some similarities between the first two cases that i found in the second case . the first case was written by a young couple who has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . they have only been able to visit their children for a short time , but are still pretty sick . after the third case , the kids started to get sick , as did the people who brought them home from their hospital stays .|0
this film is on my list of worst movies ever made . the story is disconnected and it is difficult to write a description of what happened next because there is too much detail . the part i liked best was that it was not like a movie or movie in which we can tell the truth about who we are . it had a lot of character problems that were left out , and most of the scenes were just too stupid to even begin to look good . for example , this movie has one very important rule : any movie that has been filmed by a person in the first place would never exist .|0
i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination , like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights . there was something very interesting about it that would have made me want to turn it off and put it somewhere else , but my imagination is always running away with me . i do n't even know why i bothered to watch it at all . it just seems so stupid , i ca n't seem to find anything funny about it at all . i just could n't stand it . what if it had a plot ? i did n't really watch it or think about it - i was too scared to .|0
"a great film . every moment masterfully conducted by toyoda and his crew . the actors give credible performances all the time . i never thought it could have come from anyone . 
 "" let me get this straight , "" i said . "" you make films like this , and they end up being just as shitty as this movie is ? "" "" why bother watching them now ? it was always a letdown to see how well they were doing . these are the worst movies i 've ever seen ( which is not saying much for the first year or so ) ."|0
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once displayed a light, sardonic touch with beguiling material such as ""Whistle Down the Wind"" and the original ""Stepford Wives"", completely bottoms out here. Not only is his direction inept, he also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the scenery, is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script."|1
Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent which is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. At least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor.|1
i feel terribly sorry ! where the lubitsch - pic was enchanting , marvelous , full of spirit and elegance , this film had a very boring ending . you see , i know this movie is n't as good as some movies in the movies , for sure , but it still has a nice touch . i can tell that it was written by people who wanted to read the book or watch the movie itself . not many actors are brave enough to follow their personal desire to try to go outside of the box office at all , so this is a great place to find inspiration .|0
"where do we start with an offering like this ? i nearly said film but that would be going a bit too far . 
 "" the movie is not really based on much of what happened here , if you know what i mean . it does have some pretty good highlights from my past , but nothing very useful . the only thing that is positive about this movie is the fact there is so little to tell . at first it was just a lot of static , but after a while it became more entertaining for me ."|0
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military.|1
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time.|1
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending. (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along.|1
everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to ' the prey ' . endless nature footage of a man being attacked by a giant spider and trying to get away from the monster is also well worth watching . however , i thought it was going to be quite dull and boring . if there was ever a story in this movie that does n't make me hate my parents , this is it . one thing i do appreciate about this movie though - you can always watch an opening scene where the villain is captured by a superhero .|0
this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film . the direction just sucks . i 'm sure that if you were an author , you would be disgusted with this thing . it was good , but not quite so good as this movie is . at first i thought it might be ok to watch a lot of crappy movies ( especially the same kind that we see on cable ) , but they are all very dull and dreary . most of the time though , i get a kick out of watching them . i have watched many such movies over the years .|0
"Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. ""The Vampire's Coffin"" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs."|1
* * * * * spoiler or two , not that is matters * * * * * * two : this is my story ! the plot is just as good as i could hope for . it gets even better every time we see each other . you see , when i got here , all i needed to do was get into the movie , take a walk through the park , and be at home before dawn . then i got out and headed over to the house to see if there were any clues that might lead me to the answers that will help me figure this out .|0
This thing, directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. I hope Troma or someone would distribute this film in the States, so that you guys out there can excperience the French stench at it's worst.|1
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. The main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. That is the entire movie. I love to see very gory movies, especially since in America real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. So yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. But it just isn't really disturbing.|1
"i did n ' t expect much from this movie , it was just one of those movies i thought i ' d seen . i couldn ' t say for sure that the show was quite as good but i didn ' t see a single flaw in the way it was made . when the director ( and i don ' t care to call him a "" director "" ) told us we had been chosen for this assignment , well , that ' s not what i thought would happen . there were no problems in this film , or any of the other movies that have been written ."|0
this blake edwards film is n ' t too sure whether it wants to be a comedy , a drama or a comedy . he does n't get the first clue as to what it will be like . in fact , he gets the last half of this film for free ! i did n't really pay attention to how it was taking place because all i could think about was my friends and why they had to die . i know you do n't understand me , but i can relate . it took a big load off my mind and i got to sleep that night with no more than a few nightmares .|0
"I'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and I love this movie.It's no ""Mystic River."" It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he's good in this. So are Julianne Nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!"|1
i ' ve spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film . i ' m in total agreement with the critics . i feel that these people were meant to be actors - you know , writers who make great films - but as i saw it , they have made little or no progress . even so , one of them seems to have more than adequate acting skills . he just doesn ' t get it . at least not yet . he ' s doing an excellent job , if you can call it that . there has to be some good writing in this movie .|0
this is simply a good ole fashioned western . . not overly complex or long . it does n ' t deceive itself , however , that the author and his audience ( although they do act funny ) think this is the funniest movie imaginable . the director was very disappointed when he discovered how quickly it got turned into bad comedy . the cast consists of two women : one who is also a female , and one who is a guy . for the next thirty minutes she gets up from her chair to dance with all four of us .|0
"If you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.I couldn't help but to think to myself, ""Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?"" Example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck."|1
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.As a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor.|1
so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a little fun in some of the other episodes . at least my parents had made it clear that i had no business watching the show . i did not really like this show . all the action seemed too slow and boring for someone who loved to watch films . even though i liked this show , there was still a sense of disappointment in the first few seconds as if i would have enjoyed watching it more once i was done . the whole thing just felt wrong .|0
"it ' s painfully obvious that the people who made this ` ` movie ' ' have never seen such brilliant spoofs as this . i don ' t see how they can make any real effort to make this movie sound interesting . but it does seem like a good idea if you ' re one of those actors who wants to get into action and do something really special , right ? "" everyone in the audience was watching the exchange with an open - mouthed expression . 
 "" what ' s going on here ? "" asked bob mcmillan . 
 "" oh , yeah ! """|0
i had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on tv . it ' s the perfect example of how to deal with a relationship , where one guy spends half of his life making sure someone has a good relationship and the other half trying to avoid having to deal with those relationships . in fact , it ' s the first time that anyone ever showed any interest in this movie . the premise is simply ridiculous . the people involved do not seem to know what they are talking about . why am i sitting here watching this ? there are too many problems for this book to be worthwhile .|0
this is one of the worst movies i ' ve seen in a while . the acting was just soooo bad . it ' s like you were watching a really bad horror flick but on a better , much more interesting movie . the only thing missing is the sex scene , which should be interesting , but that doesn ' t count . i found this film rather depressing at first . i suppose if you have to see someone die for a little while and then not do anything for another two weeks you are going to get over it .|0
a great movie, with a rather unclear political message. it´s shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear, but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie.|1
my only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie . i had n't even made an attempt at doing this in a very long time , and did n't have the energy to get it done . so when the credits started rolling , i just let out a sigh of relief and sat down hard on one of the chairs , with my feet up on the table and my head resting against the back of the chair . as much as i wanted to turn around and walk over to see if she was alright , i simply could not move .|0
Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.Every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless.|1
when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliche . with character names , i can just imagine what that would be like if the director did make it through the entire film without making any movies at all - and he was supposed to be one of those people . he was n't , but i had an inkling as to how bad off he really was . in other words , his acting was mediocre . his writing was pretty good , but his acting quality was abysmal . the only reason he was doing this was because there was no money or fame in being a star .|0
look , do n ' t get me wrong i love independent films but come on ! i could barely sit through a movie when i saw it last . this was one of the biggest films i had ever watched and i did n't even pay any attention to what it was about or how it was directed . all i wanted to do was watch the rest of the movie . my eyes were drawn to the other movies that were available on the shelf . none of them featured any special effects . not a single one . there was an odd amount of people who came to this film .|0
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie, looking at after war, psychical problem, from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of Vietnam war, causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father.It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past, with whomEmilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal, and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with.Protective mother looks at this problem with warm , and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.|1
just watched this on dvd three times - once the ' normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive sequence that i never paid attention to so much as the fact that they actually made one of those . and i really did not know what any of that had to do with the previous two movies . there must have been a ton of fun going on in here . the first thing you have to notice is how many people are in here all day long and how many go home at night to eat or drink some sort of late night snack .|0
` ` witchery ' ' is a decent little euro - trash horror yarn ! david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one . he seems to know just about everything that anyone says or looks like he knows what he is doing . i am sure that most of you are not all that familiar with david hasselhoff , and that makes him hard to believe . he has been famous throughout the world for his acting , acting , acting as an actor . there has never been any real reason why he ca n't take a joke and laugh it off without any problem .|0
"I'm going to recommend putting this one in the ""skip it"" pile as well. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah, well.....The costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the Period Costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - everyone dressed like they were at court in Versailles."|1
what a dreadful movie . the effects were poor , especially by todays standards , but that was forgivable . i think some of the other actors are just not very good at anything else . this film is absolutely terrible and it gets to the point where you get really annoyed . i thought maybe there was something else out there that could make this movie so bad . when you do get really annoyed , you usually end up making a bunch of movies . well , here i was watching this film one day , and i was surprised at how bad it was .|0
with its few touches of surrealism , lwhtrb works as low - grade horror , but as a major follow - up statement to this novel it has great potential . in fact the book is so good you can just make out that it has never been before written . there is nothing on the screen about the plot or genre . i will admit i did not really like this movie , even though i have seen several movies and had my share of them . however i think this one was worth the effort . it was an excellent way to start the day .|0
the greatest movie ever . how ' s that for a contention ? however , if we look at it through purely cinematic means and take it to extremes , well , in this i see something that would make some people uncomfortable . after all , why would they watch such a crappy movie when most of the time they were watching a great movie themselves ? this movie had so much drama behind it . on the surface it looked cool , but in the dark , there is nothing to say you will ever actually see a movie and not realize what sort of person you are letting into your soul .|0
"there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made it . the only thing that truly makes sense is the fact that the movie did not get as much as a 5 ' x 10 - inch or 6 "" screen image , which is what you need to have in order to be able to buy an actual tv ! and the first thing you should notice is that the acting is not exactly the same as most of them . the cast is more like a collection of actors than a movie ."|0
the basic idea behind ` ` dungeon of harrow ' ' is n ' t all bad . the acting , however , is not . i would suggest that you give this speech in a very positive light . we should be able to use it again on the following nights : http : // serializellie.blogspot.ca . here are the characters from the scene . i hope this will take your mind off your current issues . there is something i need to say to you . i know how hard this thing must be for you . i really do . i think it was horrible .|0
"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down."|1
i ' d never thought that i would be caught saying this : but i think ` ` dog the bounty hunter '' was probably the most obvious one in the story , and so i did what i didn ' t mean to do . i wrote it out of sheer boredom rather than from any desire to see my friend again after the long hours i spent at work . i have done a good job of pretending to be depressed , even though i am happy about everything . i really didn ' t know what else to do .|0
This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else.|1
"First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never ""big"" here in the US as it is everywhere else.That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen.Now, I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over and this show stands out.The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was terrific."|1
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. I've seen Used Car Dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids but Wow! The plot line seemed OK but the director should have required more from his actors.|1
Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.|1
I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well. I will however give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti japanese propoganda. The japanese are portrayed as incredably evil b**tards who have respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense.|1
"i watched the world premiere of this on the starz action channel . they call it vampires : the turning of the vampire into the girl who will one day be a vampire . 
 "" let 's see if this has anything to do with blood sucking , "" i said , not that it did . i mean , why would someone get up and walk down an aisle of a nightclub , looking like you just saw a zombie movie in the ' 80s ? anyway , here we are - at the front of the line , waiting to buy tickets for some sort of charity show ."|0
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda . it came no wonder the whole country has been in a state of terror since the end of world war ii . i had read somewhere about an old movie by a woman who used to live in the us . she did not have any children and was forced to spend her time cleaning up after her children . i can think of several people who would make a great actress on tv . i mean , if there was anything at all attractive about me , it was my lack of ambition .|0
i loved the first movie , the second one was okay , disappointed john cleese was n ' t jean bob anymore . after watching it for a while , i had to agree with my brother . it did n't really look as if there was much action at the end , although there could be some action in most of the parts . they looked like something that happened years ago and not quite real . but this is a movie and you ca n't expect it to go all the way through every movie , no matter how good it is .|0
how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds , a ragtag team beats the big time by a whole million people ? i ca n't believe i was just given an award for my first novel . it was so easy to pick this film ! i was so engrossed that i did n't see what happened next . i was too worried about not looking like a complete nerd . but now i had a good idea of what the movie was gon na be about . i could n't really tell and i have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to watch any of these things .|0
that ' s a weird , weird movie and does n ' t deserve a better mark than david lynch ' s one ! it wasn ' t worth the time , effort and effort to make this play . i don ' t think i would have been able to tell if it was a good movie at all . what really sets me off - the fact that people were talking in a foreign language with very little american accents , or that the characters seem to be in control of themselves and speak english , or the fact that the plot did not even have an accent .|0
The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is awful, the female leading actress is chubby, and the story is... wait a minute... There is no story...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to to see Piranhas, you might be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas.The only thing that I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end.|1
i looked forward to seeing this movie , because the trailer made it look so cool . but the fact that it was supposed to be filmed at all does not stop me from wanting to go home and watch another episode . you know what ? i really think about how stupid i was thinking when i bought this movie . let 's just call it my obsession . i should have gotten a copy of this movie for some reason . after all , i had been dreaming of getting this movie . i could n't help it if i loved this movie more than the first few films i 'd ever seen .|0
as a fan of henriksen ( i liked him in the ` ` millennium ' ' series ) and of course lorenzo di morre . they had been friends from the time of their inception until they met at an unseasonable point in their careers . during one of their brief encounters , lorenzo di morre showed up at the villa de montepulciano for a night out , and he introduced them to my parents who had recently come from barcelona and were looking for me . when i went to tell them that i had gone back to see them , they immediately began asking why i would go through all of that trouble .|0
if you ' ve ever been to ukraine , this movie is absolutely hilarious . from teenagers wearing gold chains , to middle - school girls wearing fake hair , to those who wear makeup and are just trying to look good , this movie shows up in the history books as some kind of parody of comedy . it is completely unappealing . i would hate to call it a movie at all , except that i am sure that it has more to do with what they think they have than with their own opinions on something . but then again , why should anyone care what other people believe about it ?|0
rififi is a great film that is overlooked . it ' s a crime drama where a man gets out of jail , only to go straight to prison for life . you ' ll think they ' ve been doing a good job of getting their plot wrong and putting them on camera . in fact , no one even sees the original film until about five years later . this was probably the worst film i did ever see so i have just seen it before . i really didn ' t give it any thought as i wasn ' t very much interested in watching it or reading about it .|0
a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life . it could be set in any town in the world or at any time in this era , for all the history that i have ever seen or heard about it . as far as movies go , these movies are nothing compared to what really goes on in the films you just watch . there was a great deal of action along the way which is typical with many of the more violent films from the 1970s , ' 80s , and ' 90s . i always wanted to see one of those classic movies that had some sense of humor .|0
jack lemmon was one of our great actors . his performances in days of wine and roses , the apartment and my home were wonderful to watch , even if he lacked much acting . however , there are those who would call this ' show - breaking ' . that 's me ! i just ca n't understand why anyone would pay money for this as well as movies and such . what a waste is this ? it should be played like a play . how can you have something so fun and still have so much feeling in your stomach at the same time ?|0
well , some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin . as it happened , i really wanted to see this movie . so why did i take off like i did ? there was no harm in the movie , but then what was there to see at all ? i should have listened more carefully when i first went to watch this movie . this movie is a waste of my valuable time . the only interesting thing about it is that it was not based on a reality show .|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines, and impeccable writing... but that's exactly what I got.Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the show's center and soon-to-be-president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious sorority on campus), isn't exactly supportive of his plans.|1
` ` first snow ' ' has an intriguing beginning . a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man who knows more than he does about the business world -- and this is not unusual in the industry . after all , how often do you get a job on a trip to mexico city to see a mexican ghost town ? but then you get fired because you had to cancel your interview with don quixote for two hours ! when i came to las vegas and discovered it was the most boring part of the entire show , i could not help being disappointed .|0
In the mid 1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities.|1
"low - budget but memorable would - be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre . vulnerable , naive nurse charlotte beale ( who is in a similar position ) takes an early break and walks into the main office of the hospital where she sees a bunch of doctors and nurses looking at her like she is insane . she goes straight to her office and immediately begins talking to them about what has happened , not knowing what else to say . when she returns , she asks the director to please call an ambulance from a nearby hospital .

Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my man I would never disrespect. Those Mobsters were spooky. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt u if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why?|1
"Well, this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a ""master of commercial suspense"" or maybe a ""compulsive technician"" -- or was he really ""deep."" Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at his best, he could not have been all three things at once.In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit."|1
in yet another case of misleading marketing , this film is included in a 10 - movie dvd set called ` ` women ' . i have seen the movies many times , and am very fond of them because they are so entertaining ! i also saw one that i thought was pretty good . it was the most entertaining i had ever seen during the time of this movie . this was the first time i really watched it . it has to be about 4 years old , and it did not make the film sound very good , like the others .|0
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others. I was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. I still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half.|1
"I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue)."|1
who ever put that review as ' of bad taste ' is not all quite there . . . its so funny , when i first read it , i was surprised at the similarity between this novel and the other two . i am very disappointed about this one because i thought they were supposed to be an original . this movie is absolutely atrocious ! it has a cheesy plot with just a touch of overconfidence in the ending . if you do not like how this movie turns out , why ca n't you tell the truth about what is wrong with this script ?|0
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the most underused original SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't suit Junior in the least.|1
"Based on a fairly bland ""best seller,"" this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't in it. The women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.The characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great."|1
i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful . there are very few laughs and lots of action , and it just does n't do anything to prepare you for the real thing . the story starts out with this character being chased down by a group of thugs in a neighborhood where there is an apartment complex . they were trying to make some money off of a girl who had just moved to town and got caught in a trap . the thug gets away with it , but as soon as he gets close enough , he stops and goes back to his family to try again .|0
"in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi ( e . g . the score and its opines ) , but is it really what it seems ? i mean , you can see why i would be concerned . as far as i know , we have never seen one of these guys do anything that was not considered "" bad "" . the acting is terrible and awful . the scene is horrible ; it is completely out of control and utterly uninspiring . most of the cast has no idea who they are about to become or how they are going to get on the film ."|0
probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there ` s no real hard core sex scene to this movie . it is , however , fairly well executed . i ' m impressed . so what else have you learned over the years about this film ? one thing is clear . it ' s a little slow . i thought for a moment that don ' t happen often , and found myself wondering what the whole process was all about . now i see how some of the characters can make themselves seem more convincing than they really are .|0
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable. It's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers, and MacNee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg/Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and a who the hell is this guy Gambit.|1
I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through.|1
"There is no reason to watch this film.Why? Many reasons. First up, the acting is awful. There is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. It is awfully written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line.""Repeat?"""|1
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap.|1
"""Chupacabra Terror"" is saved from a '1"" by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of THE RELIC. John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. He does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome."|1
This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. Straight from the coke-filled gutters of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene.How so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?Get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job.|1
"This movie is on cable sporadically, and I never really watched it, thinking it would be similar to the Bruce Willis film ""Ïn America"", with the usual trite story about American freedom, etc. But it was not; it was so much more!.Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I have never seen him in a movie I haven't loved, even if the script is bad, because he is so talented). Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job."|1
the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour , but nothing more . the film is extremely uninteresting and i can only recommend it to my family , in case they find anything that might be of any help to me with this film . so i have no idea if it will work or if i could just give you a call after the cast gets out . i am going to try it . do not even bother saying ' please ' when i say ' go ' . i may not get what i want though . there are too many unanswered questions .|0
I like Arnold, and I love the subject matter, but this was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I admit, most of his are pretty good!). He had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited.|1
i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull . well , after watching it for the longest time , all i can say is that it was one of the coolest things i have ever seen on tv . but it had no good qualities at all to use as bait . and i could not see how it would be useful . it has been too long since i saw an old television made of metal . i went back home to check out the new tv and it was still pretty cool . i mean really cool . it was just so old .|0
This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. As a grad '83 boymyself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times atRidgemont High )stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; thevapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are allrepresented here.I have seen this over ten times now. The music in the film was topnotch. Unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx orLoverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out recordsand tapes (it was the 80's after all !)|1
Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know.|1
"korea ' s answer to ` ` i know what you did last summer ' ' follows a similar story route to its current ending . ' the real question is ' who were these guys shooting at ? ' they all look like they just stepped out of a movie . they are dressed in old military fatigues and have a long - time war history . they look about thirty or so with no distinguishing marks .

I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy.|1
ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie . but this movie has been in my family for more than 20 years . its first sequel was titled the third time around , when it was made - and there was a good reason why that was so . if you want to watch an ' 80s movie or something else like that , you will just have to go to the movies . i mean , i thought it would be easy to read , but this movie was even worse . i saw the title and it really sucked .|0
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. Anyroad, here's a few things I learned about Mexico from watching this film.~All Mexican Women Are Super Hot - Remember that little desert town in Unearthed? Yeah, well, this must be it's Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. She'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~Half of Mexico is controlled by insane Satan-worshiping Palo Mayombe cultists.|1
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension.MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down."|1
lucio fulci , a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety , ill - advisedly tries his hand at black humour in which the whole world goes crazy . what he has no idea is how many people are watching and thinking about that movie , who are they going to ask ? well , i suggest one of the most unpopular films of the 1980s ( although there have been other movies made in their time ) . it was just before 1971 when hollywood premieres the movie . i can not remember actually seeing this film until recently , except that it appeared in 1992 .|0
"""You can survive anything"". Anything except a dumb horror flick. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of ""docu-comedies"": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. Some genres cannot be mixed."|1
"The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  ""why""? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation."|1
"David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. ""eXistenZ"" is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game."|1
This film makes several nods to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a Replicant (He is blond haired and is called Ryo, a homage to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?).|1
Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job.Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.|1
korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head , and the latest by the celebrated director chan - wook ' s is a comedy with a very high resolution . in the film , it does not even start with a bunch of scary characters jumping from tree to tree . the story itself is a good one , but the plot is bad . i will admit that my love for this movie has changed a bit over the years , but i think that it ' s made me appreciate the fact that i have spent most of my time in hollywood since 1975 .|0
plodding , maybe that should have been the title . bad dialogue delivered at a snail ' s pace . all this is for no purpose other than to be a way to make me feel better in the book . so far , i have spent the last three hours on my knees trying to think about what to write down . i ' ll have to let you go , because you know i love writing ! i was hoping that i might write a few more reviews but now i find it hard to finish the book .|0
this is the worst of the toxie series by far . the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can see that most people have a bad taste in movies . this film has been based on japanese tv , which could be worse . but it goes beyond that . i have never felt like this at any time . i was n't sure whether to try and enjoy the movie as if i had been doing so before , or if i would need to get a real job to pay bills and keep the kids from getting into trouble for being out of their mothers ' way .|0
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. Kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. This role was like many he had made already,One can see why he was a big star for so many years.He filled this role easily like a well used glove.The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a fine actor Robert Walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress Jennifer Jones).Robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films.|1
"Did people expect ""Jurassic Park 3"" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil."|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C&W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, creepy former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave.|1
David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over.|1
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show.I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she once again kicked butt. It was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys.|1
i was really beginning to enjoy this show . it just started out slow and it was n ' t given the full impact of the plot . but i had been to the theatre a lot in the years after my father went to hollywood for his film . it is very entertaining . the only point that i like to remember is when i watched him perform . as a young boy you could almost believe he was a man , but on the whole , he looked like a man in his prime . there were moments that made my mother cringe at times , but they always ended well .|0
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. The acts is so awful nor the plot. The story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, you name it! 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so below average film.|1
it ' s unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera - work and busy characters at all . just because it ' s a bad movie does not mean it ' s an effective one . i can ' t tell you how many times i ' d had this movie made , but this film didn ' t look half bad . it actually appeared to have been filmed during its time as an amateur noir movie , and is very well loved . in addition , there are quite a number of humorous scenes which never fail to amaze me .|0
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape.|1
robert mckimson ' s ' acrobatty bunny ' is one of the director ' s finest shorts . although the circus - based setting may be very good if you really know what it ' s about , this show would have been nice if you knew the main character , a man in his 60 's who was only 18 years old with an undefined career path and a long history of womanizing to boot . this is such a ridiculous thing that i could have easily laughed out loud had i known what he was up to all these years . i think i just got tired of listening to him for five minutes .|0
this was a modern tv classic ! the story goes like this , bob has a girlfriend named alicia . he loves her because she ' s beautiful , smart , kind , funny , brave and very smart . they move to new york city in just four days . that is when alicia is kidnapped from her house by the police . we have no idea where or how she got away . there is no record of her being living in new york city on this time of year , so we ' ve never heard of her until recently .|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by Bodrov Sr.'s hackneyed and confusing script, which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. Most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited.|1
a middle aged man , robert jordan , set in his ways , takes on a boy scout troop after some bad things happened . this is one of the most disturbing situations that have been played out so far and has caused me to lose interest . i was just as shocked as you all were by it . i am sure many would disagree with me on this ' film ' but we do know for a fact that no one has done this before . i just hope it was worth getting involved in , even if it will cost me my job .|0
i wanted to like this one - the situation was rich , and the setting unusual and interesting . but if it did n't come together , then maybe i 'll just go for it . i will see what happens when you 're a celebrity . ( 2 ) my name is susan , and i live about two blocks from my mother 's house . i went to school with my father as a kid , so that 's where i saw him on his way home from work at the end of last year . he works at a hotel in las vegas .|0
ben affleck , about to be married , is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the most famous movie stars in the world . there are other pictures of it , too , and they 're not all good . but i see that this is a lot more fun than expected . at first , i thought it was gon na be quite entertaining , but as far as i am concerned , it 's just awful . if you get the idea that i have no interest in any of this or anyone else , i 'm sorry .|0
this movie was terrible . it is not something that people should have to pay to see . it looks like we need to give this movie more credit than the rest of the film . if you really love this movie , you would appreciate some reviews or critiques from critics . the acting and editing is great . it is a shame that no one else can do this because the characters all seemed so unconvincing ( which is saying something ! ) . but i will admit that this film is rather good as well . also , i just want to say thanks to the editors for making this movie worth watching .|0
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The oldest son has just comeback from Vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie.|1

This movie was alright. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.Right away two French boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, along with that, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they're in Paris, the fashion capital of the world.|1
Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you.|1
sorry to say but was disappointed in the film . it was very very rushed , as i suppose you would not expect such an ugly and dirty thing to have been printed on a public library website . this movie was one of many movies that had come up on my inspection list so if you are still looking for someone with an interest in history or history , then perhaps you know something about it . i have no doubt that this film is the first of its kind ever made . it really makes no sense to me ( and probably because it never has before ) .|0
"At the beginning of the movie, Ramgopal Verma says that ""Sarkar"" is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic. Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. Amitabh Bachchan plays ""Sarkar"", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home."|1
I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. I am 35 and he is 17. He liked it and I did too. It still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on TV. But obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would have continued for all the seasons.|1
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion! I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role!|1
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. Sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, OTT and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.There is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on.|1
a couple of years before scream spoofed the slasher / horror genre with savvy , self - conscious young things knowing every trick in the book and yet being able to watch the movie without feeling embarrassed by it . i also loved this dvd . it makes me feel so alive ! when you watch all of these movies they take your breath away but that was nothing compared to seeing what happens to them after they let go of the moment . i could just not stop watching them . i was really impressed with how good the movie was .|0
I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!! !I did buy this film for a dollar and I've seen much worse for much more! !This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. Eight grand!!! That wouldn't pay for half a minute in Hollywood!! Nevertheless ---- This is top fun film making. If you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. These are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing.|1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I seriously don't think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not.|1
Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe. The music from award winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.|1
"I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some dialogue snippets:Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): ""You see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, the other fills. It is so with the world. At present, you are full of power. But you're spilling it, wastefully. And Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket."" Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past."|1
i enjoyed it . there you go , i said it again . i even bought this movie on dvd so we can see how a lot of girls in the ' 70s do it . if you buy this film , please take a look at some of the scenes , and then tell us what you think . i know it was hard for you to believe , but i have had to watch it myself many times over the last five years . they really did an amazing job . this movie is actually very good .|0
"With a name like ""10 Commandments"" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark-made film. Remember ""Noah""?? That was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had ""some"" truth to the original story. However, Menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated."|1
YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous.|1
This is no walk in the park. I saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt like I'd been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded.|1
does anyone else think that ` ` reba ' ' is basically a ripoff of ` ` roseanne ' ' ? just look at this movie . my dad and i go out every weekend , and it 's great for me , but the rest of our dates were so boring that i stopped talking to them . all i remember about the movie is what i saw on the screen . now you know why i did n't say anything . i never had much to talk about , and i was mostly disappointed that i never got to meet any of the girls i went out with .|0
Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love.|1
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.|1
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah ) , each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key, noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. Aided by her , anything but enthusiastic, male friend, the two of them reach the end of their quest , but with a price to be paid.|1
"I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre.It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful.The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims ""Bunnyfluff!"" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!"|1
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I've liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies but I'm afraid that having the other characters call him Chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris.I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film.|1
this is a great little movie , full of interesting characters and situations . while not in the same class as most of the other film trailers , there is a good deal of information about it that we do n't get for many hours because it just comes up too much . i think you will find the plot is similar to the rest of your school . the main character is a boy who seems to have had some bad experiences . his name is paul haverford . at one point he looks like he might have been taken to a real movie , but the ending is very different .|0
i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me , but i think i have an idea : one of the characters is a nice guy . i want to catch him and put him in his place . then i can finish my book , see how long it takes to make the film , and take it to the editor . that is if they still have them on tv at all . this would be interesting . i was looking forward to watching this movie once , but now i wonder where it got to . there are three other things i could give you about this show .|0
Everyone knows that late night movies aren't Oscar contenders. Fine. I mean I'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and figured I'd get to some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the info on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave it half a star. To be fair, I did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious.|1
"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books."|1
This movie made me so angry!! Here I am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. The scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must I go on? There are porno movies out with better dialog than this. I understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. This is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning.|1
"trite and tiring , the one - liners almost made me cry . my 4 year old left the room and ended up going out of the house . when i realized this was his only chance in life to make an impact , i could n't stop myself . i called a friend at school but he just laughed in my face . he said it was all right because it would be too much for him to listen to me talk . so we both went to see a movie .

"there is only one word to define the whole movie , that is : awful . how ` ` mostly martha stewart "" is used . a lot of the scenes are so bad that it takes my breath away . but this movie is great . as you can tell , i have just been sitting on the sidelines with my hands on my knees and my legs dangling over the edge of the sofa . when i was younger , i thought i would do well at school . but now i know that it will be a disaster . this movie has had an enormous impact on most of the kids in this class ."|0
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch. With such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. The excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. The photography in Empire Falls was lovely.|1
this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie , thought of two or three funny lines and made them laugh . so it did go that far . i ca n't even imagine the amount of effort it is costing to get the film to run like this . they are really making an effort , but how can anyone make fun of these people ? maybe they were trying to save money by playing the most popular tv show on television . after all , in this movie , one of the funniest comedies on television is going to take place with a guy who has been given a great title .|0
` ` chupacabra terror ' ' is saved from a ' 1 ' ' by the presence of canadian cutie chelan simmons as the only female lead film on the show . i would have thought that if it was anything more than a one - shot series of action movies in general , it would be obvious that they are all bad . but it is pretty clear that the reality television channel is good , and you can not really judge how good . the movie starts off slow enough that your friends might enjoy it . there is some comedy and some comedy in the script , but nothing like this .|0
i love this show . i watched every episode last year . i bought the dvds . and i tune out every time i watch one . when you spend your time watching a film with someone else , you just ca n't avoid watching it . i 've never felt so alone in my life . this is an empty place in my heart and i hate myself for it . i can understand how people might look at me . i mean , hell , they 're all trying to find a reason to hate me anyway . but this is the closest i have come to feeling sorry for anyone since i was a child .|0
this is the worst movie i have seen to date . 85 minutes of utterly bad acting , ( half a year ! ) , all for nothing . it was such a great movie and i hate it when people get upset over one thing that they can not do in other theatres . you are so unfair to anyone who watches this . i just love it . why does the film have to end like this ? i really need to take a vacation . i ca n't wait until summer break . i would like to see my friends at the beach .|0
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. The characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems.|1
there were many ' spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s , and although this has a strong role in some of these stories , i believe it was written in the late eighties . as you might expect , the movie was poorly made but not terribly bad . at one point , a man walks in wearing a dark leather jacket and black jeans who looks nothing like the type of gangster known for being an evil serial killer or serial killer . however , the characters are all too similar , and they seem very alike .|0
"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. It came no wonder for me that this is admired by most American viewers and hated by Europeans. This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.You have been warned. It doesn't even have ""guilty pleasure"" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.I wish I could enter negative values, admins?"|1
first - nick - 623 , pearl harbor was bombed in 1941 , not 1942 . they did n ' t have to predict the result . there is some evidence of a plot to blow up fort sumter , but it isn ' t that simple . most of the movies are made in 1942 , so how does this lead me to believe that there is any connection between the attacks and the movie ? the truth is i do not know what the real reason for the explosions is . as an amateur actor , i have only seen about three movies of this type before .|0
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. You can, however, see how far she has come.The one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s.The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting.|1
I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The acting is good and the story line was OK except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.The film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. It has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for Ash Christian I thought it was good.|1
i ' m sorry but i ca n ' t agree that this was a good movie . yes , it looked good on dvd , but i can ' t believe anyone would want to watch that crap . and there is always the possibility that someone will get into a car accident ; or they could get killed in an accident . what i can say is that i actually have seen this movie several times over the last ten years . i ' ve never really wanted to watch it . i watched it every day since i got back from florida until my mother left me about 15 years ago .|0
Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through.|1
all the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced . that is their main justification to take it out of theaters and do the whole thing in front of people . what 's the point of a film when you do n't really have an audience ? ( 2 ) the acting is pretty bad , but not that bad . i watched a lot of tv during my time as a teen . after all , i did watch a lot more television than i ever saw in my own life . still , i ca n't figure out why the actors can do any better than this .|0
The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love.|1
while the prominent and over use of the play - like format is in total operation throughout the film , it is impossible for us to imagine that these two characters would ever find their way back home . i will tell you one thing ; they have not made a single effort to come up with a good name for how to do this production . some of the names we read and see on the cast are very different than any of our other movies . many of the people in them seem confused as to why or how to act in this film , and some even appear completely uninspired .|0
"What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works' themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim ""strangling the boy for the purity of his scream"".You can't fault Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality."|1
I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort I managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on like this but I think you're getting the point......nothing happens ever in this movie.|1
"this film is all right , fairly silly and to be taken lightly . but what i ca n ' t stand about is the overall story . i can ' t help thinking it looks like this movie was made by an older person . there isn ' t many people on the bus who could have seen this movie , if they thought they were being filmed by one or both of them .

i ' ve seen various hamlets , and i ' ve taught the play . as i watch jacobi , i ' m surprised to find my mind is wandering off into a fictional world . there are many strange things going on but that was the worst one i ' ve ever experienced . what is wrong with me that i could be so stupid as to follow a movie without seeing any of the characters in it ? if you read all the movies you wouldn ' t believe this movie was worth filming in the first place . i couldn ' t even imagine an action flick like this !|0
for a teenager who has never read austen , this adaptation might be fine . but only for them . if it is done with the wrong characters and the right plot , i am not disappointed . i am looking forward to reading every last word that is written and i want to see what kind of person can make the novel look as though it had a happy ending , which it did . there is just too much to tell about the story . when i was a kid , my mom made me watch an entire movie in hopes that i would enjoy some of the stories .|0

"Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film ""experts."" it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he has done."|1
the mario series is back , and in my opinion , better than ever . galaxy is the most creative movie that i have ever seen or watched - and what a waste it is . there are lots of interesting stuff , as well as tons of other boring movies . i am actually looking forward to this movie ! when i came on this show , i was quite impressed by the acting ability of the character , and the script itself . but now i want to check out the second half of the film . the plot is simple , and it has an engaging ending .|0
this movie was sadly under - promoted but proved to be truly exceptional . entering the theatre i knew nothing about the actors except they had great acting ability and an incredibly good performance . i could n't help but wonder what they saw in this movie , how did they react to it ? for the most part , the actors looked like normal people . that is one of the reasons why i loved it so much when i watched it . as a writer , i know my work is not often praised , because i have spent more than half of my life working on these movies .|0
A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part.|1
"Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed ""The Guardian"". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible."|1
` ` landscape after a battle ' ' opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather short order , it gets worse , and when you think about it , it gets worse . what do you expect when you live in a foreign country and are surrounded by troops ? they are not going to give us the benefit of the doubt , that is obvious , but they have nothing to do with this . i mean , look at those people , all armed and waiting to strike , just like any other civilian .|0
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the CPUSA was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). The troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the KGB did, and presumably, what the good patriotic Americans were fighting. Yet the FBI did them and didn't bat an eye.|1
OK, this movie, was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion.|1
i saw this movie last night on hbo & did n ' t expect to get hooked - i usually fall asleep in front of it . this movie was totally messed up . it 's really a horrible film . it is one of the worst movies that i have ever watched , but if you watch an awful movie it is worth watching . the plot is completely out of control and i just wish my mom had n't shown up . there are so many characters ; they seem to do everything possible to save me from myself . i hate this movie .|0
"This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the DVD at the video store and think ""why not"". Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) at how good it was and how much I enjoyed it.Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it."|1
i caught this movie on local t . v . at about 4 : 30 a . m . i did n ' t have expectations for it , i didn ' t even expect to see this in print . if it ' s any consolation i didn ' t expect that this movie would be just as horrible as the last one . and then there was the video itself , but not really . who could tell what was going on over there in the movie - all of the dialogue was mostly bad , and the actors seemed rather inept . you can ' t say i liked it .|0
"HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in ""The Big Green"". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Police Academy"", ""Cocoon""). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie."|1
"A bit ""the movie in the movie"" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the ""real"" one.As any Cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. Can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it."|1
"The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of ""Drake & Josh"" fame, personally I'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier) and the ""Rick Punchers"" joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom."|1
"Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed ""victim"" messing the whole set until she finally ""die"". Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina."|1
i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about jefferson . this film was one of the worst comedy films i 've seen . it just keeps on getting worse and worse , all the way down to the fact that the actors are in serious danger of being murdered by assassins from the same terrorist organization as they were trained to eliminate . if you want to see a bad show like this when you have no idea who they really are , you need to get your head in the game or you will lose your mind .|0

everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor , and when i first saw it i just felt stupid . but even in a world where robots can not be played , i had a similar feeling . that is one thing about robots - they all have different attitudes and opinions . however , their programming is so consistent with humans ' that you can imagine that they would not understand the real plot of the movie . if the characters were really smart or at least sensible , then the script would have made up for most of its faults .|0
I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off.|1
i remember when this show came out . it was originally advertised as a mini - series . at the end of the episode the director and producers did n't have enough time to explain what they were making for this particular movie , so we had to watch it in order to figure out what made it tick . here 's where you get an idea how ' s on the other end of the spectrum : someone is trying to buy a book from the same vendor , and they ' re not doing a good job . the plot is very different from anything i have ever seen .|0
i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and i must say that i never felt more in love with those movies . it had been one of my favourite films ever , and i just wanted to watch it . if you want to see how a girl goes into the bedroom with her underwear on , then by golly this is what i would call ' good ' . however , i found it strange at the time , i was not prepared to do this for free , so i did a quick google - search of the movie as a teenager .|0
for me , reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film - - and of horror cinema , in the way that it is presented . i do not intend to leave this story with any regrets . i have no intention of writing this film in any form , unless you can think of any way to make a movie similar to the ' thriller ' that i have seen before . these films are about people who are lost in a time - long struggle against something bigger than they know or care to admit .|0
it ' s worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film . three main female deities - - wise and one of them in particular - were the only ones who existed , and a few others are actually very old . but what is interesting about the movie ? i ' m quite sure that most of the words were meant to be bad , but how can you know if it ' s really true ? i found this particularly tedious due to the amount of time that i spent trying to make my story sound convincing enough to keep everyone happy .|0
Right up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Too bad too, because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot.|1
"So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the ""Carnosaur"" trilogy, ""Pterodactyl,"" ""Raptor Island."" Then I flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie SciFi placed in its glamorous, Saturday prime-time slot. Some movie I had never heard of before called ""Raptor."" I was pretty excited. The movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a Velociraptor."|1
"There are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind ""The Ransom Of Red Chief""! Even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler."|1
"Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book ""Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman"", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married!"|1
"Wealthy businessman's daughter, who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath, discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by daddy (whom she affectionately refers to as ""Darling""); worse than that, she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live, leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's screenplay (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot, which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk."|1
although i rarely agree with filmkronikan , i have to say that this film while not awful , just did not hold much merit . it seemed to be an attempt to put the audience into a mood of enjoyment , and there was no real basis for producing such films . i can tell you now that the plot of this movie was not what it appears to be . the theme is based on a story that was first introduced at the end of the 20th century . the characters are all middle aged men and the dialogue is similar , except in the cases when the actors fail to make any sense at all .|0
while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography ( i thought a more purposeful approach would be better ) but i do not think this is possible . to say that it ' s easy to enjoy a good movie is an understatement , and no one in their right mind would play this movie because there is so little emotion involved in the process . i was hoping that you could use this film as a basis for your criticism of the premise , if you are a reader or reader of the author . this movie is rather amateurish .|0
this movie was made on a relatively small budget ( 10 - 20 million dollars ? ) with almost no promotion at all . but that does n't stop the fact that the first thing he saw when he walked into the theater was one of the most famous actors in recorded history , who i know could have been better suited for the role . it is clear to me now that the script is very amateurish and totally ineffective . i do n't see how anyone could pull off an acting director such as these . why were the actors not allowed to give their own voice ?|0
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. Isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?I also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around Southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion.|1
Y'know, it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...Anyways, it's been a long time since I've watched anything Muppet related, but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character.|1
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth. Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash. Then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set. And to make matters worse, EVER heard of stereo? If the camera switches, the sound always stays centered.|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. A bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.It's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex.|1
a total and absolute waste of time . bad acting . bad story . predictable . simple . pathetic . it was the worst damn movie i 'd ever seen in my entire life . if i could have moved a quarter of the world to see this movie with me , i would have . unfortunately , i do n't trust anyone . so instead , i am sitting alone on an empty road , watching the most amazing movie i 've ever seen but not feeling anything at all . i am too consumed by the fact that there is something very important that i need to share with you before we go to bed .|0

driving lessons from the writer of the critically acclaimed films , mrs . brown and charlotte gray , jeremy brock brings his wife and two children with him as he travels through a series of places in france , australia and the philippines . i think he ' s exaggerating the amount of time it takes him to get to this place . it could take weeks , years even , just for him to really get here , especially if he does not know how to drive ( which he probably does not ) . however , that ' s not why we are meeting here in the first place .|0
i loved this movie but then again i am a big cronenberg fan . if you have not seen a few movies in your life it is nothing to look at . there are no romantic comedies and none of them are any help either . the only thing that really makes this movie interesting ( besides its being a bad movie , as such ) is the fact that some of the actors are actually good actors . i thought that would make things a lot more exciting and interesting , but instead it gives me a headache . i was wrong .|0
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. Apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst.|1
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of Christ or something, I mean Halloween isn't that important is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?|1
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because I'm telling you, its just awful. The acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. And the werewolf? Its like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is that bad.|1
a special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles . i have read some of these stories to find them fascinating . so why not go back to your time when you were a child ? because the movies were terrible , too bad the characters were more than they appeared , and if you had seen some of those movies at one time do you know what a mistake it is to watch an action - adventure movie ? no , let me get this straight before you laugh . the movie was horrible enough as it was but the plot was horrendous .|0
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And a more off-the-wall storyline too!A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed.|1
a moderately interesting start , some pretty scenes in sixteenth - century japan , and a promising idea . but the execution is so bad that it causes quite a ripple among the characters as if they were about to become part of a plot line . you can learn more about these things when you sit down with your agent to review the film . ( although i 'm sure you would not have paid any attention to the first part ) . there are lots of places like this in south america where the movie does not end well . none of them are even close to the real story .|0
Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through.|1
This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig having been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. However, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided.|1
nbc had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of ` ` the ten commandments ' ' and ' the seven commandments ' in one of the oldest - most modern films of its time . i 'm not talking about the movie itself , but it would be nice if someone else could do this . i know it is really good and the film has some great plot lines , but it still makes me want to cringe at what it could be doing . however , there is one thing that i am quite sure of . this movie sucks .|0
i was sorely disappointed in this movie . twice i was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were funny . but the worst thing about the film is that i could see my parents and they just stood there , staring at me with wide , unblinking eyes . i had seen these kinds of scenes dozens of times and i do n't know why it never made much of a impression on me . the only thing about it that really surprised me was the lack of any comedy . not that the acting was horrible , but the act was lame and boring .|0
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work.|1
i am the sort of person who never , ever watches animated movies , but i make an exception for those that do . if i did , this is the moment where i really would have hated to watch a movie that was not so bad . this movie was just great ; it was fun and good entertainment . however , in the end there was always someone who wanted to go through with the film because it seemed to them like it could be pretty funny . i mean , how long does it take to get all of the action and comedy ?|0
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley. Yet there is one moment, typical Wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the Indian wife of Gable. She has gone to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Nada. One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema.|1
This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc.|1
this movie surprised me . the box is misleading , the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the dialogue were completely wrong . in fact , the only thing it gave me at all was a feeling of utter lack of empathy for the poor man . i was not sure if they were making it up to cover up their own inability to appreciate the real actors or whether they really felt sorry for people who suffered from uninspired portrayal of them . there was nothing that would have made it worse than having to sit through such a horrible production .|0
movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning . motion pictures are works of art , but this series was a waste of time ! the only person who saw the first films is me . it was not long before i had to go back to watch them all . even if i have seen this movie over and over again , i know nothing about it . also , there is no point watching it every day . now that i have an opportunity to talk with my family , i ca n't help but be bothered by the idea of watching a movie for free .|0
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls.|1
Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong.|1
i was expecting ` ` born to kill ' ' to be an exciting , high - tension film noir . instead , it is very disappointing . the script is as predictable as a movie , and i have been impressed by the ability of this movie to change the direction of its plot in a way that would make one believe they could actually get along better on their own . this movie is not nearly as dull and boring as the one i 've seen over the past couple of days , but at least these are good stories . there are only so many ways to make movies like this up .|0
dr . marnie bannister ( magda konopka ) is a horribly disfigured woman . when one of her colleagues discovers a suicide note taped to her bedroom wall , it is with some surprise that we learn that her husband was murdered in his own bed and has no reason to be alive . there are no witnesses who could possibly have seen him do this . the only evidence of any murder in this case would be an anonymous letter - or , more accurately , a videotape . i suspect that the story will end up being just as unoriginal as the actual crime .|0
the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and the feeling of total dependence . if you want to hear about a girl who falls asleep in your arms because she did n't sleep properly or because she was scared that somebody might see her and try to kill her , then this movie has better things to look forward to than spending an evening in bed with one of the most successful directors in the country ! it all comes down to having two characters who are just like each other .|0
"During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: ""Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? ""So, my comprehension of this movie, was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it.These are the things I found in ""Four shades of brown"". In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:1."|1
why are there no good reviews ? because this film is hysterically bad . set in a japanese prison camp in world war i , the story is about a young girl who comes to the united states with a broken heart and does not want to die . when she discovers that she ca n't save herself , she finds it impossible to get help from someone else . she starts by being beaten up , raped and forced into a sex - filled brothel . she finds out that her fiance has a gambling problem and is looking for a way to get some money from his brother .|0
This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... I am in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius-. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to come by.|1
another lame attempt to make a movie ` ` gritty ' ' and ` ` thought provoking ' ' - whatever the hell that means . it is not my favourite , and as you can see i was quite disappointed in the whole genre of science fiction . but i had to agree that it did have some interesting elements ( what would n't ? ) , especially this film where the protagonist turns into a monster who runs away after being caught trying to escape with his head on fire . the most interesting part of it all was how many people could be killed in a movie like this .|0
"In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything ""real"" about this legend need to grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. You guys seriously need to grow up.The fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't do it either."|1
"this movie tries to be more than it is . first of all , the acting is horrible . you ca n't help but wonder what makes people do such horrible things and why they do so much . second , how can anyone believe anything that is supposed to be good ? i really like this film , it was made by a man named bob miller . i think it was based on some old american film called "" the war "" in 1949 . it does have one thing wrong with it : the ending is utterly unfunny ."|0
"It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no ""Look at me Kimmy!"""|1
i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off at the beginning . i felt so bad because there was such a disgusting story , and then i saw the plot of that movie . it was like watching some terrible horror flick , all messed up and horrible . the only good thing about this movie ' s ending is that it got me laughing . i did not think this movie would have come to life in theaters . no way . i do n't care how much it cost , but it didn ' t matter .|0
This film is so 1980's and that is what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. Reagan in the White House telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. Young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead.|1
this film is a nightmare ! the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as if you were awake , but it is not real ! you see the world through another person 's eyes . you look into your own mind and you are disappointed . then you have to come back in reality for a second time . well , you have been tricked . the plot is terrible . we just watched it on television . there should be an end to the story . i would like to hear that movie one more time . i want to watch it again and again .|0
stephen sondheim ' s sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with an uncompleted set of songs , a new album by a different director . i had heard some of it but did not enjoy it as much as my mother and sisters . in fact i was too tired to hear any of this music at the moment . there were too many dead ends for that sort of rubbish . i got so tired of listening to this stupid film that i decided to just watch it ( see if i could stop it ) .|0
mixed group of ` ` experts ' ' ( explorers , divers and scientists ) venture a mile underground and go another fifty feet into the sea before they find a rock in the bottom . these ' experts ' also find a rock that was just lying around for a couple hundred years . after searching for almost twenty years they finally find it again . i have a friend who goes down to the sea sometimes when he gets tired of watching the ocean waves . he said there was a lot of debris floating all over the place .|0
"I love this movie. Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called ""big fat liar"". Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. I don't think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is."|1
I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed. The special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. A typical unimaginative slasher flick.It's hard to believe, make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots.|1
i really liked the far cry game , nice graphics , good level - design , interesting and clever enemies , above - average overall . i was in a bad mood because it seemed like there had been no progress with my characters at all over the past few weeks . i do n't want this to be an example of that kind of ' love 'em or leave them ' thing . i mean , look at this movie ; you can tell by the way it is presented that one of the greatest movies ever made was the last one .|0
"If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up, I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out ""the reason"" and gets involved in ""the game"" by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a riddle fanatic, and also gets entangled in the game."|1
Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain!|1
I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen.|1
if you want to see a brilliant performance of mikado , played to perfection with expert timing and panache , you would be shocked . i saw it on my way home from school one weekend when i was talking to this chick that came to see me . i got the feeling that she was here for something else but decided to skip out on her movie . i thought maybe she could give me a tour of the building . she is quite beautiful . she had dark hair that curled just a bit . she has a great figure and the cutest little breasts .|0
no music . no stupid masala . a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on what we are hearing here today , is pretty convincing . not only that , but it really does n't work . this movie is so much more complicated than anything anyone would ever see or feel comfortable making . i mean , why should someone choose to make a film about their childhood as a child when there is nothing wrong with their childhood ? it just seems to be at its worst . my parents ' main problem is that they do n't know what to expect from kids nowadays .|0
This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, Tobias Wolff.Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, I won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself.|1
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi,Don Cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.The movie opened in 2 U.S. theatres in late April 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007.We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off.This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill.|1
this is a truly terrible sci - fi / horror film from 1957 . in fact , despite ed wood , jr . and his dreadful portrayal of dr. frankenstein , he has been the hero of this series for over a century . at one time i had expected something quite worse ; now i think i may even be enjoying it . after all , we are the only remaining survivors of the holocaust , which makes this movie as bad as they were . but then i started seeing things that i had no interest to witness before .|0
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart, and I think this is one such work. The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art.|1
"*****Spoiler or two, not that is matters******Two things stand out about this movie. First is it's been titled both ""Bruno"" and ""The Dress Code,"" and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.Second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. The adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in."|1
I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film.|1
well , i ' m an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such argento , fulci , and all the others . but if it ' s not you , then do you know who might be out there ? i ' ve read about them , but they ' d never been in any kind of serious trouble until a couple of years ago when a friend of mine decided to watch the film with him . anyway , i watched it . it is so boring that i just ca n't figure out why anyone would waste their money on that movie .|0
a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original - - and while this film is about a woman who wants to be a broadway starlet but ca n't get into any theatre in the world without a costume , i believe she will find herself just fine . i would like to see some of the acts ' movies on television that are based on this film . there are quite a few of them so i feel i might like to watch one or two . if not for the constant stream of people talking to me , i am sure i could actually enjoy it .|0
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her great fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection.|1
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.If you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't, BTW), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's.|1
ok , if you are a fan of mystery science theater 3000 and love to mock movies , then you may be reading the wrong part of it . there are lots of times that have been called suspense fiction in this movie , even as a child . unfortunately for the characters , none of them really understood the plot , or could have had a clue what they were saying , let alone how they came to be there . after some time i decided to play along by trying to find out why everyone seemed so fascinated with these things .|0
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. It uses every cliché in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.It is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie.|1
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not Europeanbut a sleaze Americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. This installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.Now what I find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.These sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre.|1
this was a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a mature adult who lives on an isolated road in the middle of nowhere . i remember my mother trying to teach me what it was like to be able to look into the eyes of my father at any age and learn that they were blue . she taught me that there are two types of people in this world - good , bad , beautiful , attractive , and most importantly , untainted by anyone who would harm them .|0
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three. )Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story. )No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here.|1
"like a lot of people , i loved the original ; ` ` american graffiti ' ' was one of the great movies that i watched in high school . it was just too much to take in . i had to write my life story down and stick it onto a computer screen or i would lose most of my credits and have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to watch a movie . when the film begins , you ca n't believe it - it 's as if there is nothing left inside but a bunch of pictures which seem to go on forever .

big spoiler right here : this film is b ! a ! d ! but enjoy , it ' s good , and i ' m not much of a theatre person . i like to think that i ' d be better than the other kids in the neighborhood if i had gone out more . i hate to see anyone else do the acting , though . we don ' t have any actual talent to speak of , as there are no actors in this film , so let ' s try to keep up with them .|0

"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment."|1
after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have fallen out of the window . i could n't believe what i was watching but it was a great piece of entertainment , even for a tv show . when the story begins on the same page as the other episode where the actor is being tortured , the actors get annoyed and start throwing rocks at each other . the act ends abruptly with the actor losing his temper and hitting the villain in the face before getting into a physical fight with the villain .|0
I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.I am grading this not even as a regular film,but as a T&A film,and this is the worst,lamest,crappiest and most awful movie i've seen.the acting,story and music are all terrible,not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the T&A connisuer.it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost!|1
At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free his no good brother Claude Akins from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman.Russell kept law and order in Laramie the same way that James Arness did it in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time.|1
"this movie , although well shot and superbly acted , was awful . i felt as if i was watching a movie in which no one really paid attention because they did n't care about any of the words on the screen , or the overall content . when i saw the movie it was like someone had dumped acid on me and now i just could n't stop breathing . how could such an awful plot ever come into existence without some pretty good acting ? why are people so bad ? where is all of the emotion that would have made this movie "" perfect "" ?"|0
i watched this movie tonight and i do need to say that it is horrible ! i expected it to be a comedy or something else but it was very bad ! i can understand that they would have had to take a really good look at these characters , who are probably in the process of being forced to get married . after reading this , i decided not to watch it for the rest of the movie . i tried to watch it but could not stop watching it . there is just no end to what i found out as the movie goes on .|0

soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling . it also starred joe estevez , gregg thomsen , and robert lopez . however , there are a lot of other movies that we might like to watch , including the little mermaid . these films were not very good when they were first made , but they have been in my family for a number of years . i am sure that none of them could make it through this movie without a small bit of talent and help . i hope you enjoyed them , so please feel free to check out the rest of the series .|0
van sant copies hitchcock ' s masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets : a walkman , and nudity from the fifties , which is an extremely bad film . the scene is so much worse than any other film that i will tell you that i did not have enough imagination to even begin to take into account all the weird things that occurred there . the first one of course had nothing on this movie . the second one actually took about 20 minutes to plot . it started with a bunch of men trying to kill each other over a woman 's body .|0
` ` garden state ' ' is another of these ` ` indie ' ' - type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for a film made at the age of eight . i think it 's hilarious how those people do this sort of thing all the time and try to look cool when really they are just hoping for something new to happen . you can see where i am now ; i 'm in a very bad frame of mind . every one of these people must have had something to say about their careers , but none of them were able to say much .|0
"While it's not ""perfect"", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! ""The baby swallowed the watch"" was always my son's favorite line.Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall."|1
i watched this mini in the early eighties . sam waterson proved himself to be a great actor . in fact , he is just one of the few people who really gets my sister involved in anything . she loves her role but she still feels it is unappealing . we all love our roles too much . there 's always been something that keeps us alive . sometimes i like playing this part for the characters . sometimes i just love being on the stage . maybe because i have to do this scene over and over without any real skill or inspiration from my character .|0
"nbc should be ashamed . i would n ' t allow my children to see this . i definitely would tell my children that you were not responsible for any of this , and if i had seen it again , i would have thrown them into the deepest pit in the dungeon ! "" a lot of lights were on tonight . some of them were very low . most were bright , and some of them were just dim . the whole theater was full . people were staring at me , but i paid them no attention . i was too upset to be impressed by all the drama ."|0
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. The characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.About an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh ""oh, that is really stupid."""|1
i saw this movie on television as screamers and loved it . i heard an interesting story about this film . i do not believe that there are many like this out there . one of the worst , if you will let me put it mildly , is the movie ' s title . for the first time , i have a reason to dislike people who actually make films ! i know this film has some great moments - such as having sex with a beautiful woman and having sex with her . these movies were never very good but they were certainly entertaining enough to keep me from being totally consumed by my own thoughts .|0
this film makes several nods to various science fiction films . the prologue reminds me of the one for the movie i was watching at the beach last week . the characters are much more predictable . there is a woman who seems to be getting into trouble and a man whom she knows but ca n't really identify with . this movie is just too boring for a young boy to watch , and the premise is so bizarre that we can not imagine what it might be like to see it on tv . by the end of the film my eyes begin to get heavy and i close them for a while .|0
i was looking forward to the guardian , but when i walked into the theater i was n ' t really in the mood for a movie , and so it was made up . my friends said nothing about it until the next night when i took them all by surprise by acting like a child . oh yeah , you probably saw this movie many times over the years , but even before that i would have thought it was stupid . we sat there listening to some crazy talk on the radio while watching bad movies . as far as the kids were concerned this movie was just one of those hollywood horror flicks .|0
A young man, named Danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named Bix, who agrees to tag along with Danny and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the town creep, Jesse (played by a perfectly casted Jack Elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie.|1
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. I did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. Am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings.|1
Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all.T hey (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead! He better be put on a lead and stay there!|1
Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact, I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death.|1
the tv announcer who introduced this late one saturday night said it should have won oscars . quite a statement , i must say . but if you are not looking for a show of strength , please think twice about taking that crap ! well , i was going to take some pictures of the video when it was made , but i guess it went away because there was nothing new to film . i had to work myself into the ground to try and watch it . here goes nothing . let 's hear the story from the first person on the cast to see if the movie has been approved or rejected .|0
your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . even with all that is left , it 's a wonderful film . and the characters are great . they do n't know what they 're doing . i have to say , i had no idea this film was such a waste of time . how could people sit through an entire day of this ? why were they so dumb as to listen to the original script ? there should be a law in which every movie starts out pretty much the same way it does for each person involved .|0
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. I didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all.|1
The series does not start as it means to go on. Although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. The first ever episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and Marina Sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. Seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually.|1
"when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie , but it did not . the actors were all wrong , and i think the director wanted to make sure that we had something funny to say about this movie because he knew what was going on . i asked him if i could watch some of the film , and he responded that there were many reasons why this movie was called "" comedy "" in the first place , and none of them were interesting enough to justify the budget ."|0
"My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: ""If I were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I couldn't imagine Hell being any worse. Jim Varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). Now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a Varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. Not a laugh. Not one."|1
a rather mild horror movie ; if not for a couple of sex scenes , it could easily have been funny . in fact , i am glad that i found the movie so funny . the plot was pretty bad , really bad . there are no characters at all , apart from a group of people dressed up as zombies and some of the funniest things i have ever watched . i mean what the hell is this movie ? i ca n't believe that this movie had to be shown like this . this movie is probably one of the biggest blockbuster films of the past 20 years .|0
` ` ghost son ' ' is lamberto bava ' s best film and , at the same time , also his worst one . but he was very good in this book . i will tell you where he got that great movie . as a boy he played a small child who would sometimes sneak into the garage of a house to steal candy from a cookie tin . i think it was an unfortunate accident . anyway , while this is an excellent film , the main reason we were sent to this particular trailer was not because of some stupid plot line , but because of the quality of the film .|0
i have to say this is better than most syfy outings , but that is n ' t saying much . the plot is not as bad as others of our kind ' s made up . when a group of men come to this town and look out for these two women , we know their story . in this case they are going to get kidnapped and tortured . if they don ' t get rescued at once , they can only be captured or killed . it ' s an easy choice . the woman is dressed as a middle aged woman and the men appear to be police officers .|0
i cant go for long describing this tittle , simply because i do not feel strong about it . i can relate to the horror that is being portrayed in this movie but the plot is much more ridiculous than the reality of it . if you want my opinion , it is one of the longest movies i 've seen in a very long while . even though it was n't as good as the film , the overall effect was great . the characters were all so funny and well - dressed that i almost thought they could have been an actress .|0
move over manos . back off boogens . it does n ' t take a baby genius to know that malibu beach is one of the most beautiful places in the whole pacific northwest . i 've always heard that the ocean is made for sand and sand , but there 's something wrong with that . not only has the sea looked so clean on the movie screen , it looks like someone had just washed all of the sand out of its surface . after watching this movie about two hours ago , i could n't believe how fast it got started .|0
i just watched this , an early harold lloyd short film that featured his ` ` glasses ' ' character on kino . it was about a man in his forties who he met during a party and they ended up staying together at a hotel in los angeles . by the time they had made it home , he had already lost weight . he spent three weeks trying to find out how to move around in new york because he was so nervous about the journey . one night after dinner , he woke up feeling uncomfortable in bed and saw himself in the mirror .|0
I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable.|1
"the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the movie , so i think you 're doing a good job . "" "" okay , i 'll get to it , but i really need to ask you a question . were you at the theater with any of us when the dvd was on ? "" "" yes . i was sitting in the back row behind them , and i did n't pay attention to what they were watching . i also noticed that most of the action seemed to be very bad ."|0
the material is poor . . . . the script ' s dreadful . . . . the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what i imagine to be the worst sound . i had a good friend in los angeles who could make it up for me but she could also write an awfully good movie that took a lot of effort to produce . i felt as though there must be some flaw with my acting that made this movie even worse than it actually was . i would not have been able to find the film so i decided to look for something better .|0
this new movie by jeskid is awesome ! check it out and you ' ll be amazed . the story of the film is incredible and the scenes are so well scripted that a small child could just sit quietly in his seat and wonder what would have happened if it was n't for a very good friend who gets to watch it . now , i ' ve been watching many films and this one seems to be quite boring and boring . not because it contains no interesting stories but because they don ' t make any sense . i hope you enjoy them as much as i enjoyed watching these last two films .|0
We've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. In fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on June 25, 1945.The war on Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a Nazi spy ring was helping out the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater.|1
"probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurts it the most is the hero . he ' s got loser in him to go along with everything , which just sounds more and more lame . the characters are all big on heroics , but this guy really wasn ' t bad . i bet he won ' t even read a good romance novel . maybe if he hadn ' t died of cancer , we would have known where he was so we couldn ' t get in his face . there don ' t seem to be any redeeming qualities in him ( not even his inability to do "" anything useful "" ) ."|0
As the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the X factor? This question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law).|1
note : after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the television show . a few hours ago i had thought it would be interesting to see how many characters , plots and plot changes can be committed in the same movie . it did not take very long for us to get some good ideas from each other . you are my favorite story writer of all time . even if you are trying to be funny there is still an element of humor to your work . however , i am getting tired of people talking about the movie as if it were a historical event .|0
For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result  Petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).Overall, The Mad Monster is one dull and poorly made Poverty Row thriller.|1
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: I'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is the ""other"" lead guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band."|1
historically awful . scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity . one can not keep track of the number of times that someone has used this movie to have their head blown off . i ca n't see anyone going through the motions of having any fun , because they all seemed like morons . it was a really shitty movie and as soon as i watched it , i wished i had seen it on another person . anyway , here 's how it ends . first off , if you would like to know anything about movies , you should watch this movie more often .|0
this movie made me so angry ! ! here i am thinking that here ' s a new horror movie , which i actually enjoyed . this is the worst movie i ' ve ever seen in my life , and it has yet to be released . i wish i had an opinion but i don ' t really have time for that sort of thing these days . after about a half an hour of this , i just decide to go with what i saw . i sat down on the old couch by the tv and tried to take a deep breath .|0
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that he pines after. In the same unfinished château he built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group.|1
( warning - contains mild spoiler ) a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of the plot . the movie is supposed to be good - but it makes me forget what it was made for in the first place because i can barely remember what it used to look like , let alone say anything about it on the screen . at any rate , it is an odd ending to a bizarre horror flick . the characters all appear to be alike except for their features . the ones with the more interesting facial features are very unfunny .|0
until today , i thought there only three people , including me , who considered heaven ' s gate ( 1980 ) . one of them was an ex - girlfriend of mine , and she told me to go for it . i loved her from that point on , and even though it might have been pretty hot , what i felt for her in particular was nothing like what i feel for you . this is just my way of giving a compliment . the next couple of days were fun . we watched a lot more movies and had dinner at the diner .|0
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. My aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.I also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.This film clearly falls into the garbage category.The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director.|1
I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc.|1
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. The shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.The central performance from Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.The cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films.|1
there was a recent documentary on making movies , that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about the movie . but i thought they were trying to impress each other with stories of their past . well , at least it could be fun . i have been to so many movies , and in them i can understand how people who are so far from hollywood got hooked up with films such as this one . you ca n't find any reason to go to any of these kinds of games , because the film has absolutely no idea what it is .|0
seriously engaging , intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best . mean , gripping , moody and captivating . but she was also very , very pretty with big brown eyes that sparkled , a slight dimple in her left cheek and a sexy smile . when he had first seen her on stage , he was not sure whether to be annoyed or flattered . then the movie took off like it was on tv . as far as his mind was concerned there was only one thing that could have been more memorable than this production .|0
there are no saving graces in this dreadful , stagey , boring snooze - fest , which brings to mind ` ` the first horror movie of all time ] ( and i can understand why they chose it . the movie is not terrible at all . the title is just awful . i think most of the people here are trying to say that it is as bad as the ones from the other planet . i will agree with them completely . i think it was worse for my friend , but he seems to have been hit on the head too badly to be concerned .|0
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom.|1
in watching this off and on for a few seasons , two things come to mind : one - wondering whether i could be trusted with such information . and two , wondering if he had enough experience to be able to do what he did over the course of his short career . also , when someone asks you what you are doing at a party , or if you really want to make an effort , that seems to be your biggest concern . there is a good point about this , but i think it 's just too boring to be much fun .|0
"following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood . the plot has many twists and turns ( some of which i will share with you later ) , but what does it really matter in regards to any part of the movie other than the actual character ? if you were to ask me where the film had been cast , i would say that it was filmed in america or canada . if you want to hear the worst of the film , read this story : 
 for the sake of your child , stay out of it ."|0
"i love sandra bullock - she ' s one of my all - time favorite actresses - but this is a movie that she should have paid more attention to at her first show . it was a great film , and i had no doubt that it would have been as good as this one . i got an invitation from a friend of mine about the sequel to this film that was on the way out of theaters by the name of robert mayer iii . i read this movie three times and it almost killed me . i thought it would be over soon .

"This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the ""author"" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too."|1
it ' s a shame . there ' s an interesting idea here , but it gets completely lost in a confusion of logic and reason . so let me explain : how long have we been together ? i know it wasn ' t a great start to this story , but it didn ' t feel like it was even remotely important . what i don ' t get about this whole story is how it got started . if you want to go off to college with someone else who has spent most of their life in the streets , then go for it .|0
the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman . she is very young and naïve and completely clueless about what she really wants . she gets a job in a restaurant and goes shopping , and then meets this guy . they fall for it immediately and soon start falling in love . they spend their summer together and move into a small house in upstate new york . they are married after only two years , and then go back to live together . i do not know if the relationship is going to last too long .|0
Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation Robicheaux is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers? ?, What a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected. it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time. Another FLOP, i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1:42m of wast-full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence.|1
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. He hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure by a long shot. You can't tell that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow-motion, though.|1
"There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn't actually started watching it.To begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out ""Look there!"""|1
the actors can not act . all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character . channing tatum is one example . he has a very high opinion of his acting ability to be portraying characters that have been in the movie before him , but no matter how hard he tries , it seems to always fail . when i heard this story , i began to get suspicious . at first i did n't understand what could possibly be causing the problems . after reading this book , i had to ask myself , ' why would anyone play channing tatum ?|0
"Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight."|1
This isn't exactly a complicated story. It's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. Claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. Those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. With Goya's Ghosts this doesn't apply.|1
stunning blonde natasha henstridge is the young , not - so - grieving widow in the mansion on the hill , telling her story to the audience as she speaks . what a waste of talent and money it would have been if this was only a movie . but that is just the way it is . the reality show is too hard to believe . one thing i can say for certain : i am very much in awe of this little scene . i mean , really , there must be several hundred people watching this movie , and no one knows how to handle it .|0
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible.|1
Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up.|1
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! Awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth!|1
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.)|1
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects."|1
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (luscious brunette looker Katja Biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the Mabutos. Director/screenwriter Jess Franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache.|1
this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen . i ca n ' t believe that the writer and director did n ' t see this movie when they were out with their wives . why did they choose this movie instead of the other one ? how can something like this be so incredibly stupid ? ! ? i know a whole lot of people in this town thought this movie was too bad to live . but it is not as bad as it looks . let 's try to have some fun here for a minute and see what happens .|0
i ' ve been a fan of larry king ' s show for awhile , i think he does a terrific job . but this was just about the only time i ever saw larry king in person . i thought it would be funny to see them in action , but as they all appear to be in their late seventies or early fifties , i could not agree more . when you are watching these shows you will find that many of the original movies did not make it into the film . after reading this one i decided to try my hand at getting a better idea of the story .|0
this is a forgotten classic of a film , and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for ` ` gummo ' . there is no such film anywhere in that film , even though it has been released for years . i had to buy this one just to see it with my eyes . i am very good at this job and enjoyed every moment of it . however , as we speak , the movie is ending and will not be made again . this was actually great fun , as i have been able to relate to many other writers .|0
"A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as mad. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals)."|1
"this terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame , fake - looking bird puppet which is quite amusing , and i love all of it . you can watch the movie in the same way as we will watch a movie when we have the time , but there are two main points for it to take place . the first is that the audience has not yet learned about the fact that "" moovie "" is another term for the production of horror film . if you live long enough with your children and learn how to hate the movie , it might even make you sick ."|0
even by the lowered standards of ' 80s slasher movies , this one stinks . the usual gaggle of oversexed teens is really nothing more than a joke . they just take their cues from each other or try to do something nice for the kids who need it . i have never heard such an exaggeration . i had to see this movie in high school and watched it several times with my father after the first time . that 's when i started to develop a sense of humor . then i lost it . now , i will never understand how people can not love this movie .|0
being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club ( this also includes apes / chimps and orangutans ) . as a result , it seems to be a complete waste of time and energy . some people ' re just going about their day minding their own business while others are doing the same stuff . unfortunately for the monkeys , they have no idea how to behave and all of the action in the movie is very short lived . there is so much that you would never believe if you had seen it firsthand .|0
for a moment , let ' s put aside the cultural aspects of this movie , even if it is a rather poorly written one and not particularly realistic . but when you are watching a movie that does not really have any character in it , it will make you laugh because there is no music to be heard or anything . at first you get a sense of how far off - putting this movie can be . i always wanted to see a good movie , but never could figure out why we would want to watch a show like this on tv .|0
the movie opens with charlie ( jeff daniels ) , a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood park when he gets attacked by a zombie . after taking some shots , he decides to join the rest of the crowd and spends the evening watching the movie . as soon as the zombie finishes its meal it collapses onto the ground . while this movie is very interesting i think it is also rather silly . there should be an action movie where one of these guys could have been killed by a zombie that had tried to eat him . what do you know ?|0
In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree.|1
"imagine if you will : four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in southern arizona . two teenagers are kidnapped ( or at least one is ) , they are taken to a place where they were shot and tortured by some very powerful men , and they find their way to their parents . that 's all it says . i 'm not sure how bad it would be , but i hope it was bad enough to satisfy your interest because i really did not get any feedback from them . 
 "" i do n't know why you wanted me to come here ."|0
Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius.|1
i ' d like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie : # 1 angelina jolie sex . the story is as follows : after a short period of time , two women find each other and they can not stay apart for one day . while this film is good , it is very boring . there are no pictures of her or any other girls that appear to be interested in her sexually . the main character is a girl with blonde hair and brown eyes . all she needs is a couple of glasses of red lipstick and some lip balm , and you could make a ton of money .|0
this movie is not the scariest of all time , but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick where some idiot gets involved with something that might be worth watching ! this is really fun and i feel like i am in the best mood i have felt in a long time . i can see why the producers would give me a two hour break for this film . however , as you can imagine , this movie makes me feel rather nervous because it was supposed to be my show . instead it took me almost three days to get here and even longer when i got back .|0
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration.|1
"It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I have seen the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fits very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character being a gun toting, badge wearing, pair of butt cheeks, shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or ""guilty"". So far, the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, play's the sobering retort to assy's A.A. antics and random ""I've got a hunch"" leads."|1
i am very impressed by the reviews i ' ve read of this film - generally well - read , thoughtful and informed , but also a bit boring . it does take me about 45 minutes to come up with a decent sequel to the book ( i still ca nt believe that it was done without my being able to stop ) , but it is quite good . there are some funny scenes which make it seem more interesting than it actually is , like the characters were made from different materials and they all had the same name . for instance , the title of this movie was pretty funny .|0
"I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised how good of a movie this was. I know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. It maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the morality play was a good one. I liked the realism which was along the lines of ""Unforgiven"". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it."|1
Sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film.|1
this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies . it may have been considered racy in its time - and the story is quite good , too - but that was not the main reason i selected it as a standalone horror film to watch on the internet . of course , i do n't actually see anyone watching the movie from the point of view of their actual eyes , but i would be happy to suggest you try to read about it on one of the cable news sites . if you ca n't tell what an episode is really about , imagine how much fun these people would be in a movie .|0
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison.|1
the 1998 version of ` ` psycho ' ' needed to be set back in the 60 ' s , rather than present in 2000 . this movie is not based on what a person does or says in it but rather how they act . if someone really likes an action - film , they can go to one of the movies at the store and read about it there . if they want to experience some real violence ( such as murder , torture , robbery , rape , murder , theft , murder etc ) , they have to find a way to pay attention and watch it with interest .|0
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. It's just that there is nothing of interest in this film. There are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle.|1
this is a very modest , very lovely movie with a great score by hoagy carmichael and frank loesser with little to no theme . what makes it interesting is the first few minutes . in fact , they make it pretty good . as i say , there are only a few other scenes , but when you think about it it , this movie has a really big impact on people 's lives . i was able to write down a few of the highlights so that i could give them something to pass the time while i am waiting for the next movie to be released .|0
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott(Marshall Thompson)has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott(Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil. On Dan's second flight, he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm.|1
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around, or that they are all the same.Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. But more important this is a great film.|1
"not the best plot in the world , but the comedy in this movie rules . kelsey grammar is wonderful and i can say that if i ever need to see another one of her comedies again i will . 
 "" it was a great movie ! i would never have missed it for the world , so let 's get back to reality . what did you do today ? "" "" i worked at the university with some friends . i could n't find my seat on the plane . i wanted to go back there to try to make things better ."|0
"this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman . her parents are killed by a man that is responsible for murdering her mother and older brother , and her father died while saving his life . this is where you get a really bad vibe . however , you must not be too impressed by this movie if you are going to understand what the author is saying : "" one of these characters was an old lady and they loved each other with all their heart . after all , they have n't been together very long - just under 2 years ."|0
"Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it! )I do wonder, however, how a certain... um, finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though--especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question!"|1
i know that the original psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake , especially a shot - by - shot remake . this film has to be made in the late 1900 's or ' 69 or ' 30s because it has to be taken very seriously . if you are reading this , you have probably learned a lot about your character over the past two years . let me introduce you to all the people who will be seeing this movie . as i said earlier , the script is one of the few films that i have actually watched .|0
"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking ""surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on"", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far."|1
"without john rhys - davies , i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie - meter . but in this story , john rhys is acting funny , and not very funny , like he 's a little boy trying to make a joke , or a teenager who has just been told his first love is coming home again . he does n't act like a kid who has just been told it is "" real "" and he wants to be seen as someone else . well , here we go again ."|0
good old jess franco ! the always - reliable choice of director in case you ' re looking for undemanding sleaze , shameless filmmakers who do not have the money to do anything . if you ' ve met my father , then you know i ' m right . the worst film i ' ve ever watched has been one of the worst movies i have ever watched . the main characters are a lot worse . it ' s as if the actors were having some bad luck . the dialogue was mediocre , the words were lackluster , and they all seemed to think their plots were totally out of tune .|0
"an on screen caption informs us that it is ' the caribbean sea , may 1891 ' . a small lifeboat is lowered into the water by a team of soldiers . after being dragged down in the water , i watch helplessly as they attempt to revive a man who has been lost for nearly six months . this picture was taken only two weeks ago and there was nothing like it .

"by far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7 + . kids who watch this cartoon will most likely think that it was a funny movie but i know better . no one likes to watch it . there is only one theme of this book that makes you laugh and i have seen at least 2 different horror movies since i first started reading it . if you are an actor you will find these two scenes are much more interesting . the worst is the "" big bang theory "" which , of course , does not work . the main character ( he ) is a real moron ."|0
it was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year ' s best family film . there were at least a half dozen other comedies that i have ever seen in the past , and they all looked like they were out of date . we did not actually see them until the last one was released on the 24th october 2004 . although i am an avid fan of horror movies , i never expected to spend the weekend at home watching this . i spent most of my time at work and was shocked when my mom invited me to watch something with her friends .|0
Why would anyone make a film like this? Why would anybody invest in a film like this? Why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? Why would any theatre show a film like this? Why would any TV channel program a film like this? Why would any critic bother to review a film like this? Why would anybody watch a film like this? Why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. This is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible.|1
"ugly women - of - the - cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight - movie barrel , combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls - in - the - shower cliches . he 's a very good actor . i have to give him props for that . if i had been in his shoes , i would have felt like this too . "" "" thanks , "" i tell him . "" i appreciate that . but now you 're getting the hang of this thing , and you 've made your mark . do n't waste any more time ."|0
No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original.|1
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity.|1
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy.|1
awesome movie ! great combination of talents ! i ' m a huge fan of david duchovny and he is outstanding in every aspect of his movie . the best part about this movie ( as far as i can tell ) is the dialogue , the dialogue , the timing . it was very much like one of those old - school romance flicks . when you come across that movie , it makes your blood run cold . you find that there is an emotional connection between the characters , both of them being actors and all . well , it ' s the same thing .|0
low - budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of ? no , not that i could tell . but it was definitely bad for business at the times . in fact , it was really terrible for business at the times . what are they gon na do with this stuff ? the only people who were doing this were my sisters . now i feel like i may be able to turn this over to someone who actually knows something about it . i think i may have just solved an old story .|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie. I thought that since I'm young and it was made so long ago I wouldn't like it all that good, but after I saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it to liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco was treated during the Early 1900's, by the Germans, French, and even the Americans.|1
normally i do n ' t bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i read and re - read . the book is a huge deal to many people who have seen it , and so we are not interested in how much it costs or what it has done to make it popular . you may find this book more interesting than anything else . but let me warn you . there are only three things that matter in this movie . two of these are the main characters being used by those actors .|0
aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in rockport ma , which is a beautiful town where there are a number of interesting places to look and see . one of the most exciting things about the film was how the characters were treated by everyone they met . as i read the reviews i began to think it was just a big load off my mind . what would be the point in wasting all of my time looking at the same movie over and over again if not to pay attention to everything that goes on ? besides , i really wanted to see this film .|0
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. There never is the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years of age. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie.|1
"some movies you ' ll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow . some you ' ll watch for a couple of days . but it doesn ' t have to be so bad , it just has to be . "" i got the feeling that he would never understand why i felt this way - how could i possibly feel this way about another human being ? i ' ve never been interested in anyone before . i was too afraid to even like any man . and yet i still had sex with someone who actually liked my body ."|0
Unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible.|1
this is probably the only film i ' ve seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are good . in fact , a lot of the actors that have played in this movie have shown a very different view of the way things work . at one point there seemed to be such an air of sadness and suffering about them . but that wasn ' t all . for example , what does it matter if they actually do love their friends and family or not ? i really couldn ' t figure out whether they really loved themselves .|0
wow , kiss the bride was n ' t that bad , but it was n ' t that good either . it sure made for an interesting read . not that this film was any worse than what we have seen from the beginning of this movie . i just can not believe a woman would leave her family behind to be with a guy who has nothing in common with her . oh , and she is single . how could someone like her ? . . i mean she has a beautiful body , but that does not tell me why she left her family .|0
Very good film. Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.|1
this woman is a terrible comedian . she ca n ' t crack a joke . she has no real character . her jokes are so awful and mean that it scares people to death . you can see that from here . every time you think about the fact that i do not have much of an idea how to act in a comedy , someone else will start laughing as well . i try very hard to be nice , and pretend that it does not matter . i really just want to enjoy my movie . unfortunately , i am never able to make out what it is about .|0
ok , it was a ` ` risky ' ' move to rent this flick , but i thought i had nothing to fear . as the show progressed , the tension grew and i knew that we would soon have no choice but to give in . the acting was so good , the audience seemed to really believe that we were making a production of it . i did not enjoy it , and i did not agree with any part of it . i even went as far as to go into the movie because i thought it was terrible .|0
*SPOILERS INCLUDED*Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay a homage to Hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie.|1
I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'.While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made.A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations?|1
a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean island . to get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto a ship bound for guadalupe , with one of his ' special ' passengers in tow . the next day he receives a large reward for saving him from a bad trip to another part of africa . unfortunately this does not take into account how much treasure there is in this region and what kind of creature it is . when you are trying to find something , it will be hard enough to find an explanation for its location .|0
Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars.|1
"Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in ""Danger Signal,"" a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment."|1
thank god i did n ' t buy this movie myself ! i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of the library because it was more than 50 years old , but i swear if i saw it i would have never let it be read . at least not in public . then again , as far as i know these movies are made by no one else that knows anything about what went on in my world . when i turned it on there were only two people and the first had to die - the director and the production assistant ( whom i think is the best ) .|0
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently, I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) , the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days.|1
one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with ` ` only for big fans of the lead actors or to show off to their viewers . ' that is how i feel about it right now , too . there are a lot of things i love about my movie - it 's good music , but it does n't have the same high quality as the old movies . the story is just too boring and the dialogue too dull . you ca n't really appreciate any of the film . the plot is just too interesting , and even if you can , you have to look back and see what was behind it .|0
thank god i have fast - forward . i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls . he starts out as an american hero , and after that he gets kidnapped by a demon from the nether regions and tries to escape on foot . one day he does manage to get away but not because of his own self - destructive behavior . the next thing he knows he finds himself in a very dark place . the worst part of it all was he was never able to find out how much he liked it at first .|0
fortunately , i have n ' t seen this film in a movie , big screen , just on a small screen with nothing else to watch . it is more fun to watch than to get an idea of what it looks like and how it can be done . so i went online and started browsing through the internet for something that looked like a real movie . maybe i was going to enjoy watching this movie but now i think about it : if you ca n't read a movie you 'll probably end up being disappointed and bored out of your mind and would rather watch a movie than watch it .|0
this representation of the popular children ' s story on film is pretty pathetic to watch . i know it is n't very exciting , but i really like the idea of being part of one of the kids ' shows . i would love to share my experience with a few other kids and see how they respond after the movie . unfortunately , that does not work out well for me . there just is not an option to stay in the background any longer . i am sorry to tell you that some of the things i write about are horrible .|0
alain resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . in addition , this short story line is made up of two characters , and both scenes take place in different parts of europe . for those who enjoyed the film i will give you an idea of what really happened at the beginning . i was there once , so it is possible to understand why they did it . the movie was not as good as i first thought it could be but it certainly was n't horrible either . it was definitely a fun one .|0
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault.|1
the brave one is about a new york radio show host named erica bain ( jodie foster ) . her life has been filled with pain and loss . she is very upset that her husband did not return from his mission in iraq . she hopes to be rescued by someone as successful as dr. scott , who is working with the doctors on some kind of experimental drugs for this type of cancer treatment . it is a beautiful night and we are at a restaurant having a glass of wine , when i notice a car pulling in behind us .|0
synopsis : the sequel to the acclaimed silence of the lambs , hannibal is a big budget production that totally loses its plot . for the longest time there was nothing else i could do but sit and let the movie continue . then i heard the music and i got up and left . i had to drive over here because i had no plans to watch this movie . i sat in my living room until about ten thirty and watched as it played on the cable box . the movie was actually quite good , if you know what i mean .|0
the story told by the cranes are flying is not , admittedly , all that original . young lovers are never quite sure what they should call themselves until they meet a beautiful blonde who tells them to get out of their car and come over for a drink . it seems that the actors ' first attempt at making this movie is unsuccessful . however , in a few days the characters begin to realize the futility of trying to make something happen . after watching this movie with some enjoyment , i started to feel more confident when i saw the other half of the film .|0
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. It unintentionally shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy OR the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience.|1
It`s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I`m psychic ?!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time .|1
"Let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it ACTUALLY TRIES TO COME ACROSS AS A SERIOUS MOVIE. From the terrible acting... ""I knew it, I knew she was possessed! ""...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. I am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. This may just be in a class all its own. The kicker is that supposedly some Cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation."|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, go up to an Arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover there's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is, after a certain dog lashes out, anyone could be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show.|1
"there are actually some good reasons , why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching a movie . and that 's exactly what they did . it took me forever to find the one that was the best in the film , so i decided to try it out on my friends ' parents . no big deal , it all works out quite well , and we go back home to watch it every day . "" paul is sitting at the edge of his recliner staring vacantly into space . he looks like someone who has been asleep for months . "" wow ."|0
got to confess right up front that i did n ' t watch this entire movie . i missed the first hour , but since then i don ' t think i made much effort to watch it . i watched the whole damn thing and could ' t tell what happened afterwards because i ' m so tired . i just wish it hadn ' t taken such a long time . i ' ve always loved my films but never really enjoyed the one that i ' ve seen . this one was actually quite good , although not as good as the last five .|0
i ' ve discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise . a christmas classic , it ' s one of my favorite movies in the whole world . not to mention i won ' t be able to watch any more for a month ! i will admit that i actually have an appreciation for this kind of stuff . if only i had done some research earlier , then i can ' t think of anyone who could get me out of this hell hole . i still don ' t get why people want to do something as horrible as this .|0
"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then ""Prosper Merimee's"" well-known story about ""Carmen."" I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes."|1
"i ' m a fan of the old sctv show from the late 70 ' s and early 80 ' s and john carruthers is one of the leading figures in this film . "" "" he ' s even more famous than he ' s appeared in the past , "" i commented . 
 "" true , but there are n't that many people that can get away with it . still , we have to make sure it never happens again . not because we don ' t like him or love him , as you all seem to think , but because he has such an impact on my personal life ."|0
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque.|1
This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. There are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device.My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. The product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement.|1
A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this. Honestly - just don't bother. A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this.|1
"There is a point in the film where the female boss of the ""death machines"" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive I think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. Except such is her delivery that it sounds like ""leatherage."" At which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The boss lady had to do the talking as the ""death machines"" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does."|1
"the plot for black mama white mama , revolves around two female inmates , at a women ' s prison in northern alabama , who have been brought to the united states of america to live with their family - friend and co - worker , usa . that makes me a little envious of this story .

some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and / or dead as this one is . so why did i agree to go there ? if you think the reason was for my death then maybe you 've been reading a lot of fiction . however , that may have been because of what i just read and it had a good story in it . yes , i saw the story written after the first chapter . yes , i even saw the story of a person who died from cancer .|0
28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history.|1
"Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a ""crypto-zoologist"" (fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: nonexistent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to trap a Chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Grecian cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to. I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either."|1
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as I remember it being.The story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know throughout was, TO DO WHAT EXACTLY?|1
this film was n ' t good at all . i was able to catch it at a film festival and did a decent job , if you are a fan of crime films , i am surprised that you have any idea of what they are about . in fact , i do not think anyone is going to tell you anything . it is like the movie is supposed to be funny but nobody knows how to joke around without sounding like a child . there is really no fun in it whatsoever , other than to make you laugh when the comedy is over .|0
"just a few words : it ' s a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he was n't here , i might have been having flashbacks to that old movie in which the guy gets kidnapped by a zombie and has to stay with the couple for several days to make sure he ' s okay . then the movie changes to a man being murdered by the zombies while his girl is at the hospital . "" i ' m sorry , but i really don ' t see how you can watch this . i ' m not very fond of this show ."|0
way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes , hit each other over the head with clubs , and tried to kill their rivals in the street ! but this time they did not do any of those things . why are there such a big thing like that ? who knows what these men might have seen during their long lives . all i know is that some of them must have seen a film or movie about it , which i can tell you was n't very enjoyable , but it was better than watching one of these horrible shows .|0
empire of passion starts out deceptively - that is , if you ' re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie . the acting is bad enough , but the film itself is pretty lame . as the story thickens , even in the midst of some of the funniest scenes , i still feel this thing is just not right . i do not really know why we have to watch this movie for such a short period of time . perhaps it is because my dad does not want to watch this . or perhaps he was just being an old man .|0
When this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. Soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. Episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat.|1
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into.|1
"The Love Letter (1999): Starring Kate Capshaw, Tom Everett Scott, Tom Selleck, Ellen De Generes, Gloria Stuart, Blythe Danner, Jessica Capshaw, Alice Drummond, Bill Buell, Erik Jensen, Margaret Ann Brady, Walter Covell, Patrick Donnelly, Lucas Hall, Christian Harmony, Christopher Nee, Breanne Smith, Marilyn Rockafellow, Sasha Spielberg, Jack Black.....Director Peter Chan, Screenplay Maria Maggenti.Based on the novel ""The Love Letter"" by Cathleen Schine, Director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big box-office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements."|1
when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry . it completely blew in my opinion of the film , making it a little less interesting . this is the kind of movie where you just know that you must make your way around to the front and watch it . well , it did n't take long for me to figure out what this meant . i was supposed to watch this movie because i would rather watch it at home than go back to my boring life on a beach . but as i sat there thinking about the film , i realized i was really enjoying it .|0
"Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie ""Paul Renauld"" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim)."|1
as someone has already mentioned on this board , it ' s very difficult to make a fake documentary . it looks and acts like it ' s going to be the worst movie of all time . in the same premise , you can ' t imagine anything bad happening to your favorite films . it ' re just that bad . but the film is worth it when you ' re having fun and looking at the right parts . let ' s see if anyone else has ever been interested in watching a real movie . well , let ' s see how good this one is .|0
i ' ve waited 9 years to watch this film , simply because i never saw it advertised on tv . i ' m afraid i didn ' t enjoy the show , and that ' s a shame . what was the point ? anyway , we are here , now , to do a special shoot with a movie of two men who have become lovers . they will spend the next six years making up romantic stories to tell their children . there is not much to look forward to unless you know how long it takes someone to make up a story .|0
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor england . the writing directing it is based on the anglo saxon story of the great danes who were captured by saxons in the viking war . it seems that there is some controversy about which king edward iv is the son of an earl , whose father is now king william of northumbria . this is a big shock to all of us because we have known of him since the beginning , and he has become a legend in many a village .|0
"duncan roy ' s writing and direction is really , and regularly , below par . actually it sort of stinks . this film is about the man who wants to kill his mother . i hope you do n't mind me saying this but , although it ' s a little odd that he would write in this script as an "" original "" , it ' s also just plain weird . it ' s like reading someone ' s life story for the first time and finding out they won ' t even remember what happened ."|0
"there is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting , plot , effects , continuity , etc . "" "" but it does n't do anything else in this movie ? "" i said .

"the horrific production does n ' t qualify as a ` ` film .

the canterville ghost ( 1996 ) . the director made this too sappy a production . maybe it ' s the generation that don ' t understand the reality , because if they don ' t , then they ' re stupid . there is nothing romantic about this film , except the way people act while they are looking into the camera . not to mention that it ' s so sad . the movie didn ' t seem to be much better than the rest of the genre . i have seen movies like this many times but rarely have any interest .|0
This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. This isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. It's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing.|1
i watch a lot of movies - dvd , features , and classics , you name it . the night is still young , and the only reason i even think this is a film is to make my mother feel guilty for having an affair with a friend of hers . i always thought she would have married someone else , but not this time around . she does n't really like people . i never liked her . i just could n't stand her . there was no way i could tell anyone what she did when she went down to the subway after being accosted in the street by a drug dealers .|0
This film was really terrible.However , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed at that for a long time.There were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that I found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end.|1
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. This movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" - 1941, and ""Heaven Can Wait"" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. The closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment."|1
i do n ' t know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad . it was great but not nearly good enough ! i loved it as a child , but i never really enjoyed it as much as i did at my old age . the main thing i love is the title and the plot . it 's kind of cool that we had to create a story for our fans to see in person . all you needed to do was make an example out of them by throwing a bunch of questions in their faces .|0
this is the worst movie that i have ever seen . at first i thought that it was going to be a great movie , but for some reason , it just was n't . as the movies go on , it goes from terrible to depressing to downright creepy . i found myself in front of a horrible scene with the worst character i have ever seen and my opinion of this guy turned out to be one of the worst . when he enters the film , his attitude is not even humorous , and he is acting like he is trying to make himself look better .|0
i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four - years - old . i had half - day kindergarten for the first time , and i always thought it was one of the more boring episodes ever . at first i would like it to be interesting but after about an hour and twenty minutes , i just did n't care anymore . even with the television on , it was really loud and i ca n't say i was too much of a fan of it , which is saying something given my lack of musical experience .|0
now i ' m a big animation fan - - love svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so - n - leave in my opinion . this time , it went much faster than the first two . i would have been offended if i had n't been so happy at seeing that he was making an effort to be more upfront in his attempts to win me over with his comments . i ' m really impressed with how quickly he put together the story to make this movie play out in such a fashion .|0
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic.|1
"The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I've seen in a long time -and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This piece of work seems to have been made ""under the radar"" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust. film making.At times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. But the stunning aspect of the film by Alex Frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction."|1
Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India.|1
conquerer of shamballa shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want . i had no idea such a story was still out there , and this has the potential to be hilarious . if you enjoy it , you can buy it at any discount store and do some research on the subject for future reviews . if you do n't have the time , i thought perhaps you 'd like to see one of these in the new york times . i have been saving this film for years and now i need to see it for myself .|0
When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I figured that I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I found still very amusing was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part.|1
there ' s nothing much to the story . a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she had bought the tickets , and then starts crying as she watches a guy die in his own house by his own wife . it happens so quickly you might think the world was coming crashing down on them at that point . anyway , i am just telling you this to see if you really believe it ( which it is ) . but let me tell you something else : after the fact of this incident , i want to ask how it could have happened ; why are people acting like this ?|0
"for anyone who has ever sought happiness , ` ` half empty ' ' is a must - see . this original cross - cultural series is actually very funny . i am surprised that even you and your family still have the ability to get along with my son .

This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was I wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive other than they both take place on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.This movie will not hold most people's attention. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud.|1
"This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. It is easy to see why ""Fire"" has caused riots in India, but tragic nonetheless. A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world, not just privileged westerners."|1
Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema. Here is one good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to the producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who in reality, is the son of the producer of the film. Hence, he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so.|1
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned.|1
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer on Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, ""From A to Zzzzzzzzz."" The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to ""civilize the savages"" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something."|1
"I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster. It is officially the only movie that I've wanted to undo watching. Let me start off by saying that I like ""B"" Movies. I consider ""Ice Pirates"" One of the best comedies EVER. I'll also note that I'm a writer and that I've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.Evaluating the acting: If I was going to pick a bright spot I'd have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this."|1
"When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought ""god, this is horrible!"" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs."|1
i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen . why is that their are always more white than black , especially after a certain age ? i really can not understand how any girl who wants to have her soul ripped out when she dies and does n't get her soul back lives as a human being . since then it 's been a long time since i 've had the chance to ask myself why they chose this movie , what makes these people think they have the right to decide where their soul goes ?|0
This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down, then moves back up into place again. The sound is crackly, and occasionally fades out then in again. In another scene, the camera man is just visible in a mirror.Then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent... which, believe me, went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer.|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist.|1
"I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounded intriguing!! This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The ""monsters"" needed more face time. We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more ""Oh Sh--"" moments. The photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. There were too many close ups. But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers."|1
the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest - scenes felt flat and uninspired . . . i really did not feel much like writing anything about the characters . there are a few times where i think this film is totally ridiculous , but it just keeps on going for no apparent reason other than its boredom . so i will let you have your fill of the film . . . . here it comes . well , at least i thought this would be boring , but this is something different . it is as if everything in this movie has been made out of a box .|0
this is a magnificent , and in many ways impressive film . i saw it on tv as a little girl . i wish i could go to it for more but i do n't want to go . so i just let it happen . there is nothing wrong with doing this , because it makes the movie fun . but what if i find out about someone else doing this ? why am i doing this anyway ? no good can come from that movie , and even if you are not a movie star , you should still be able to do your job .|0
Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face.|1
. . . i ca n ' t believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie . . . this is such a slow - paced show that i thought it was a complete waste of time . . . well , for the most part it is . . . only about 5 stars remain , but they are very nice and make you feel so comfortable in their presence . at first it was just fun , but as the film progresses i realize some of the scenes do not make sense . we should all try to enjoy this movie on the way home .|0
"Oh, my. Oh, this is a *really* bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.What does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. ""Oh, s/he died? Huh... Figured they would"" was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who."|1
although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast , ice - cream , i scream is a great film and there are a few people in the audience who want to see this film and feel some kind of appreciation for what it represents , and they want me to go out to the cinema or something like that . it 's not even about the sex , however . no , it 's because of the woman who lives next door ! when i saw her last weekend i just thought she would come home on monday night to spend the night in my guest room and be alone .|0
This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea.. However, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one.|1
now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non - spoiler review . bone eater hits its mark for being a decent guy at first but soon finds himself in a situation where he learns that he was an idiot . after reading this film , it seems like the only sensible course of action as to why bone eater has not gone off the deep end . no wonder he is so upset . after all , he is supposed to be on the same team as the others . his job here is just to see whether he can pick up a few pieces of his old man 's family business from the wreckage .|0
` ` river ' s edge ' ' was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 , and for a year that was the first time i looked in it . the characters were extremely realistic , and there was no real resemblance to the script . the film did not look like anything we would find in any other version of this film , but as i watched it with my brother , i decided to watch it more often . the only reason i liked it at all was that it made me feel good about being a writer .|0
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US.Anyway, this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy...)Why: Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. (Examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends.|1
not really worth a review , but i suppose it ' s my duty to warn you all - especially since this is so highly recommended and i can ' t believe that any one of you is going to enjoy reading this . there are only a handful of items on the list at this time , and they ' re strictly for the purpose of trying to keep the book in some form or another . unfortunately , the story seems to be coming out of nowhere . most of the entries are fairly generic , like the ones before , with a few lines here , and there .|0
"the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career (""there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"")."|1
"""A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being. His work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days. His latest creation is a (spoiler omitted), but side effects from the process (spoiler omitted),"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. ""Embryo"" opens by promising: ""The film you are about to see is not all science fiction. It is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb."|1
i was amazed at the quality of this film , particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - in fact , i was shocked and stunned by the movie . but i did see a similar scene when i witnessed this film on the television last night . an elderly man , who has had a difficult time trying to live his normal life for several years , is sitting on the park bench , enjoying the early morning rush hour . the scenery is so vivid , so different from the rest of the city . it is as though we are looking through a pane of glass into an alien 's world .|0
this was it ! i would have never expected the ending if i did n ' t already know the behind the scenes . so when you look for something like this , you must be sure that everything is in there . it is one of the most original works ever produced and it is not just based on an unproven premise by anyone who wants to see it . i do not even want to say how long i watched it ( it really does not count ) because the only time i can find a moment or two to enjoy it is as a spectator .|0
"This one was truly awful. Watching with fascinated horror, I kept on asking ""why have they done this?"" That is, taken all the scenarios out of ""The Day after Tomorrow"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Twister"" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it."|1
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed?|1
'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but was unable to finish it. I'll review this film version solely on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.|1
Well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even French, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. Lamo. It is also not that bad, not their best. I am A big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is OK and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again.|1
We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. I've seen that Junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID! !|1
before you watch this movie - clean your ears , take away the make - up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to put her fingers in her mouth , and get a good laugh out of it ! just watch this movie because i am going to be forced to do this on my first night back . it would be nice if we could all get along . so here are some things i learned from watching this movie that i think you should have seen . one of the main characters is a teenage boy and he goes off with his best friend when they leave school together for the bus .|0
by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it ' s forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin . i mean , not that i expected to see this movie . i knew of no better actors or directors but i had n't expected this to be so bad . after having watched this movie several times , i saw that it was really good . as a friend of my mom , who is actually very good at this type of movie , i decided to go over to her studio to see what sort of movie she wanted me to see .|0
well the previews looked funny and i usually do n ' t go to movies on opening night especially with my kids . there is no reason to take this personally . in fact , i felt a little weird watching the film . the plot was fairly good as it turned out but it did n't feel like one of those movie clips you see on cable . i had to admit though that while the movie was quite entertaining , it certainly was an awful movie . there was something really creepy about having to listen to the woman who claims she can talk to animals .|0
"********SPOILER ALERT************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this ""film"". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (Note, the scottish camp director...). ? And who does the shopping for the bog creatures?"|1
hilarious and low - budget comedy at it ' s best . this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self - referential humor is one of my most enjoyable reviews . while i can not imagine having done a better thing for this movie , i was surprised by how poorly it managed to portray its overall role . the characters were all obviously very young , but in fact they just barely fit into each other ' s brains . the plot could have passed as a teenage boy ' s first movie , or even a teenager ' s first movie , and that would be disappointing .|0
a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a dog . the guy says he is hoping to be a farmer , and i find it impossible to believe that there are any decent fields around here . so far i have seen no animals , trees or anything at all - just piles of trash which can only be taken as rubbish . i mean , this is a big waste of money and time ( and resources ) . i really thought this movie was going to come out as a success .|0
"I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I purchased and read the book ""Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds"". And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight."|1
frank sinatra starred in this odd little short from rko that is now in the public domain . the film is based on something that only recently happened , and even then it seems to be very small . if you are a fan of glenn miller you would find this movie quite intriguing . i never liked glenn miller myself , but he has been an incredibly talented and talented character in this movie . when glenn miller was acting , he was a good looking actor who got himself into trouble . he was a bit more charming than glenn miller , but not as nice .|0
valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart : i would say this is certainly the best movie ever written . but the most disturbing fact is that it was never written as a comedy . if you like , you can watch this film on youtube . if you hate it ( and i sincerely doubt you ) , write a review . for someone who does n't read horror fiction , this movie is very entertaining . we do n't even get a chance to have it on dvd so we had to take it away from all of us and buy it .|0
"i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up. (got introduced to the doctor by way of John Pertwee)as well as ""camera copies"" of doctor who sent to America by UK fans to their US counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the CONs, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it."|1
I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. I don't get the idea, why that kid died? ?Is a cliché, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.LOL.I don't understand what is the connection with the movie... And is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.Nothing new in this movie.|1
"I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really too bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. Why Joe didn't just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode where the ""message"" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end I was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and I won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse."|1
there are movies that are leaders , and movies that are followers . ` ` meatballs ' ' was a leader . it would have been easy for him if he had just chosen to go about his business like everyone else . the problem is that he did not pick on anyone else . he chose people who fit his own profile . he could have gone off on his own , or he could have made friends and stayed in his house . but the only reason he went out after dark was because he liked to walk alone at night . the first thing he did after midnight was see the stars .|0
"This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. ""I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin."" ""We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad."" ""It is nice when we all screw each other."" Lots to talk about! Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions."|1
If there's anything worse than this movie I don't want to see it. I remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blast away any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.|1
I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny.|1
Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games.|1
"GOLD RAIDERS (1951)A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, who I've always enjoyed as the ""third Stooge"") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting."|1
I've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast the plot hardly matters. An astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. His body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. But how did they get there? And where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in Maj. John Corcoran's body? IMDb lists the runtime for Night of the Blood Beast at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes?|1
this piece of crap is actually the bomb , as in bottom of the barrel . i ca n ' t figure out how someone could be that good at it . i hate to say so , but i thought you should know that these movies were one - hundred percent real and they looked a lot like this movie , only bigger . when we first saw this movie , i thought it would be an awesome cover for the movie , but i was wrong . i mean , seriously , there are no words to describe what has just happened .|0
I've seen all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.|1
this was my late wife ' s favorite film . i ' m sorry she did not live long enough to have seen this book , and if you like this , it is a great one for us . i can ' t believe the quality of this movie which is so horrible ; it makes no sense on paper . in fact , its almost impossible to imagine anyone going to this movie unless there is absolutely something wrong with the director , or worse yet , that he ' s just trying to convince someone to watch this movie .|0
"MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a ""light, sports comedy"" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. (Some of the superficial ""sports comedy"" results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how ""basa-boru"" is played in Japan.)"|1
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.|1
"since i ' d bought the dvd , i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of dread . and it didn ' t help that the film was made in the late 1960s and early 1950s , which wasn ' t very nice at all . my dad is an indie rock fan and spends most of his free time talking to me about stuff . i thought it was pretty cool how things went . it ' s not really something i normally want to watch , but then again , they were two years apart and we didn ' t get to see each other often enough .

everything about this movie was bad , the acting was bad and the plot was bad . and were is a good portrayal of bad movies so bad that if you just want to have it done then do it for your own viewing pleasure . in the last half - hour you have not seen a decent movie since the early 1970s and now here you are at 6 pm watching one that seems to hold no interest for you . who makes a movie like this ? ! what is the point in making a movie like this ? can a movie even be a movie without having something else to add ?|0
i like dark humor and non - pc stuff , but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself in their eyes . the other half of this book was written by my best friend from our college days who took an interest in writing stories when i was four or five years old and had to be told every day by his friends ' moms . i never really wanted to read anymore than i needed to , but what can you expect ? there seems to be so many things going on in this world that they just forget to mention .|0
the final entry in the on the buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in wales . all of them are extremely good , and there is no doubt that this movie is one of the best ever made . when i was young it was a big deal for me to read the first few lines , but it has been a long time since i cared what others thought . this movie is something i wish i could control , and maybe i can even bring it to some people 's attention . if you like this movie , i want you to buy it here in london .|0
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his directing style is usually non-existent.|1
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. But i'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst.This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer.|1
this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life . to know it 's based on a woman who could have been killed by one of her husbands ... god , that was awful . so horrible that i wanted to run away and hide in a room where all the other films had been destroyed . but i did not . i stayed . i made it through . if you like these movies you will love this movie . i hope you will understand why this film does not do what it is supposed to . it just is not .|0
this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm . we had never seen the film , even though we have seen many movies in our time here . it is something i really wish i could write . when i first saw this movie ( about a year ago ) i was not sure which one it was . i remember being intrigued by the actor who was acting and was supposed to be a star , but then my mind went blank . while watching the movie , i thought that there was no point in trying to guess what it was about .|0
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, do not see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. It's a chore to watch!Set on New year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film.|1
this movie was definitely on the boring side . the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice , though the director was kind of lame and a little too old for all the movies i 'd watched in the last few years . if you like someone , go see him . but even so , it did n't stop the disappointment that accompanied the fact that i was never able to get a chance to talk to him again . he just kept hanging around looking for someone to take over his life . i do n't really know why .|0
i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now . the acting is atrocious and as such i can not do my job on the premise because of the script . this film is based on actual events from the very first night back at the university of maryland . these were the worst nights of my life - really bad days . while i was trying to stay up , there was a high pitched sound that came from the bottom of the hallway leading into my room . i thought it sounded like an earthquake .|0
"This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to ""explode soon"" from all the crazy happenings. There was, in fact, nothing in the movie to make that line relevant."|1
worst movie ever seen . worst acting too . i can not imagine a movie worse then this . nothing like this ever existed in my lifetime ! what kind of a person does this ? why would anyone want to have an evil movie star look like this ? oh no , this movie is n't bad , it just looks good on the screen but you should know better . there is something horrible about this film . let me try and describe it . yes , i did see this once . it was a scary movie , very scary .|0
i just saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and i have to say that i thought it was a bit ridiculous , but when they put the movie on youtube it was pretty funny . i love movies of the greatest quality ever , especially the ones in horror films , but this movie has been very disappointing . the acting is really crappy . the character is too bad . the dialogue is not good or consistent enough for any kind of comedic event . the lines are horrible , the characters are awful , and the plot is hopelessly lame .|0
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people encouraged the Fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie.|1
this wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny , entertaining , sweet and memorable ( especially the part about someone being kidnapped ) . the film also has characters that make me feel good in an annoying , uninteresting way . i do n't have a lot of time to dwell on it , so i will only talk about the movie as it happens . you see , i was there at the time when the story began . the first two days were very boring , or so they tell me . i did my best not to be bored but the plot was just too bad for me .|0
i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school . i thought it might be amusing to watch how the kids at the top of the ladder got to go down into the ground . i found that it was rather good , although i did not really care for the whole film . as it turns out , there are a lot of people going down into the earth because they can not reach the earth . i know this because i watched a few films myself - some were interesting , some were boring , but all of them were pretty boring .|0
the mission to see the movie ` ` the cave ' ' was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing it on a horror film when i was in school . we could have been having some fun , but for some reason i found myself wondering what his friends thought about the movie . were they even friends or just acquaintances of my father ? oh , yes , let 's not waste any time ! first off , why did he buy this film ? how did he know that it was an adult film ? what was it about ?|0
this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book . as written by rafael sabatini , this movie was so dumb that even though the characters were smart , they never really got it right . i 'm sure you will find no fault in the story at all with the content . if you want my opinion , this film is a bad idea . i have only seen a little bit of this movie and did not know anything about its genre before reading the script . i guess when you have to spend a couple of hours studying a movie like this , what can you do with it ?|0
when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie , you can never be sure if it will be worth the effort . i had to get this one right so he would stay on camera . there was a huge fan club going around town and i loved what i got . i was always amazed that they even managed to film this movie . i did have a few friends in high school who still wanted to do this because it has been their idea since they graduated high school . we watched these movies together for just about all of 3 hours .|0
ty cobb is , by far , the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live . his baseball career was no less than 5 minutes longer than mine . it is not until later that i began to read the rest of the book . at that point i was a bit scared of him , but did not have the will to stop and question this guy 's behavior . he tried to keep me on my way to the movies , and after several hours spent on the streets , he had me back in my room . i was in a rage , and so was he !|0
i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick , and i ' ve always been a sucker for comedic plot lines , so i suppose this is how it went on the first time . not bad , but i would have given anything just to see the last scene . after that , nothing much happened . i ' m a very good actor , though , so you should get used to me being an idiot . the ending did not really help me think about anything except my life . what was i doing ?|0
"The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry ""Rain"" Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time."|1
"yahoo serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets drunk off the beach . but i thought this was going to be fun . "" well , it did n't work so we had to take a break . anyway , i 've been here for about twenty minutes . i ca n't believe i am sitting there with my friends in a restaurant , listening to some old lady who has lost all her marbles ( at least not as bad as she says ) and drinking more than normal ."|0
mickey rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a building in mexico and then explodes into a hundred pieces . it is very strange that people can go on with their lives after spending so long trying to protect the poor and homeless from being murdered in a city . this film is one of many popular films i watched over the past two years . i really like it , but now it has a bad ending . i am going to have to watch another one .|0
with its ww2 timing , falling in and out of love , and easy on the eye kira , this movie is so good i wanted to write a review at my local post office . however , for some reason i just felt like it was way too early to be writing something like this . what a terrible idea . i mean , how many times have you seen this movie and it still sucks ? it is one of the worst books i have ever seen ! there is nothing worse than making people believe that your life can be better than it actually is .|0
Not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them.|1
"A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. The tagline for this movie should have read ""Come see how f*cked up our characters are! They're stoned! They're coke addicts! They're a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter?"|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts.|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year, until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis , maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens.|1
good film . i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale . £2 . 99 seems like a good movie . i really do not know why you are complaining . it will be very educational if you have one of those videos , but what was i thinking ? no , i can see the difference . instead of making a great film , we are going to make it a disaster . my point is that this is horrible . it looks like every film ever made in the country has seen better days .|0
thankfully you do n ' t need a lot of ` ` book learnin ' ' to understand where this thing ' s going . . . if you have n't ever heard the saying that all writers go out and kill themselves to avoid the boredom , here 's your chance . first off , you should know that one person who can be an editor is really someone who lives in a fantasy world , but most of his books are made up of fantasy as well . secondly , he spends less and less time watching movies because he tries to save money from the theater .|0
